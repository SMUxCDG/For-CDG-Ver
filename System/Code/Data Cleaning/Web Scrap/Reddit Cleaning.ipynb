You may remember other posts such as the [monkey stealing bread from the North Spine bakery](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/n7njyx/monkey_brazenly_stealing_bread_at_north_spine/), or the other [monkey stealing cup noodles at Crespion halls.](https://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/monkey-steals-cup-noodles-in-ntu-then-scales-railing-to-open-it?fbclid=IwAR2MCPku30-HVB5bZRbpg-F1AanRS-2gJhcgjejscNj7w_d0kwE_y39pvHY#xtor=CS1-10)\\n\\nThroughout last semester, there have been several occasions where these macaques have invaded students\\' rooms by sliding open the mosquito net and causing havoc inside, digging through plastic bags and ripping packets of food, defecating on the table, etc. (of course I\\'m complaining because I myself kena)\\n\\nJust talking to friends who stay in the NH halls area, it has basically become a \"norm\" seeing someone\\'s room get raided or seeing monkeys camping the Cates food delivery drop-off point table.\\n\\nThere were several occasions where the monkeys would even appear at lift lobbies on upper floors of the halls to dig through the rubbish bins. The issue had escalated to the point where these monkeys were completely unafraid of people (would invade rooms even with people inside, would attempt to open bags at the NH playground even with adults and children there)\\n\\nUp til now, I still get updates that these monkeys have continued to wander common areas of NH halls.As for what have the school has done about it, they set up the \"long-tailed macaque committee\" to address this issue. Their first few actions were to change regular rubbish bins to monkey-proof bins (basically a bin with a latch that monkeys would not be able to easily open), and to set up signs in common areas that tell you not to provoke monkeys and to keep your windows closed at all times.\\n\\nThe tough part would be that with how tiny the NH rooms are, closing the outside-facing windows cut off so much air circulation that it makes staying in the room difficult if you didn\\'t have air conditioning (even with the inside-facing privacy window open).\\n\\nI imagine that one of the fastest and most effective solutions would be to install locks on the mosquito netting panels so that they would not be easily slid open. (Due to the design, even something simple such as jamming the window tracks with a long removable object would theoretically work). Yet hall administration has yet to do anything significant about monkey room invasions apart from hosting dialogue sessions and \"monkey walks\".\\n\\nI believe Earthlink (environmental club) have been trying to address some of these issues to escalate to administration recently, but for now we have still been brushed off by administration to \"hide any plastic bags from view\" and \"keep all windows closed\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TLDR:** monke messing with North Hill Residents, admin says suffocate in your rooms'},\n",

       "    'comment': 'With regards to the NTU shuttle buses, I get the impression that the university management as a whole does not treat them with enough importance to run the services in a coherent manner. It appears that the management is happy to let students rely on the SBS Transit buses 179 and 199 plying through the campus, and the internal shuttle is mostly an afterthought.\\n\\nA key problem I have with the system is that **none** of the routes have a proper terminal to start and end. The closest you all have to a terminal is a haphazardly paved patch of land near the Graduate Halls where the buses park. This \"terminal\" is located not quite along the route but in between bus stops, so buses have to end at Saraca (Blue) or Hall 10 (Red) while starting from Opp Hall 10 (Blue) or the Grad Halls (Red).\\n\\nHowever, the route doesn\\'t have a formalised start or end, so the bus drivers have to exit the \"carpark\", drive multiple rounds (up to three!) before terminating, to ensure that there is service across that gap. Anyone who understands bus bunching can tell you that having each trip be three rounds long will cause the buses to bunch up and the timings to be terribly irregular. The driver cannot guarantee that each of the three rounds will take the same time to complete! In contrast, at NUS where I\\'m based, the buses travel one round maximum and layover at a terminal that is along the route. So the departure times at the start of the route are always guaranteed to be regular - if a driver is fast and early, the break ensures he departs the terminal on time instead of too early, while if he is delayed along the way, he can speed up to reach, and subsequently depart, the terminal on time instead of late. Not to mention that if the drivers get more breaks, they\\'ll have an easier life and hopefully drive safer.\\n\\nThe timings are also not coordinated, and appear to be based on when the drivers need to change shifts to drive for other contracts outside campus, so I\\'ve encountered the situation where I get \"kicked off\" the Blue at Saraca and the next three Blues are all terminating too. Would be far better if the Multi-round trips overlapped properly.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I think the management does not look at shuttle buses with the same seriousness as we do at NUS. I used to blame the choice of Tong Tar as an operator, as I generally don\\'t have a good impression of them with their choice of off-brand Chinese buses (nothing against China but really? Step entrance Zhongtong Sunny?) and very cost-cutting \\'chapalang\\' image, running with half the fleet being random coaches some of which bear advertisements for other shuttle services.\\n\\nBut I realised that RWS8, which is also contracted to Tong Tar, has a proper, exclusive, wheelchair-accessible fleet (also Zhongtong) bearing RWS advertisements and having working destination signage. In fact, the better buses in the current NTU shuttle bus fleet (Yutong) are hand-me-downs from the previous gen of RWS8! So with more investment, it\\'s possible - Tong Tar evidently just doesn\\'t see NTU as their most valued customer, I wonder why... (Meanwhile at Sentosa, ComfortDelGro Bus sends over buses that were used at NUS first...)\\n\\nI don\\'t really know if all of this (the decision to invest more into internal shuttle) is within the control of Transport Admin or HAS or someone bigger, but I would encourage everyone to push ahead on these problems while being understanding of the constraints. I hope that one day when the constraints are overcome (like maybe there\\'s an opportunity to construct or modify somewhere into a proper terminal) then a change will really be made to take advantage of that loss of constraint, and that change can only happen if students do think about these issues and voice them out. Don\\'t give up guys!\\n\\n\\\\-The ISB Man of NUS'},\n",

Since university ranking does not look at teaching, it just gets ignored.

For students who take ureca, we are made to attend workshops that do not benefit our research areas at all (eg our projects are mostly interpretation with little to no data involved yet they force us to attend data cleaning, data sorting workshops in order to pass ureca). I’m not sure if the administration even knows this or just assumes every student has to deal with data in their projects. Even in the template and guidelines they give us, it’s obviously skewed to the sciences. Aim of study, methodology, results and impacts - these are not how a humanities paper is written. Even our profs (loveliest faculty members ever) are aware of this and are resigned to us having to skew our papers to fit ureca’s requirement. Also, it’s a known fact that it’s much harder for humanities fac to get research grants/tenure, which is honestly a wasted opp because any one of us will tell you that our profs are really passionate and genuinely want the students to do well (which is why I was surprised when I heard about fac from other schools just plonking theory on their slides and reading off of it during lecture). Humanities profs are ones that really care about student wellbeing, they go out of their way to find us opportunities when they hear about our concerns, or if they know that a student needs help say, finding a job etc. I honestly find the lack of support for the humanities disappointing but I guess it’s also the same in other countries where the arts and humanities are seen as non essential and disposable.'},\n",

I took an EEE machine learning module, but all we got from the prof was a big bunch of messy slides of pure theory, and he would simply read through them during lecture. And the prof uploaded his slides (about 50-100 slides per chapter), in a format where we couldn’t use Ctrl-F function (????). I have no idea why that restriction was there in the first place. I had to email in to request for the slides to be uploaded in a Ctrl-F-able format. The worst part was that the quizzes and final exam were based on memorising content. There was no coding involved in the entire module.\\n\\nI took an MS module that was based on pure memorisation as well.

I have had lecturers who make their own slides, with some using self-written OHP slides.\\n\\nBut the majority of Engineering Lecturers, put in as little to no effort, by using these template slides provided by textbook publishers, and reading off the slides every time. \\n\\nMany of the issues that NTU is facing now, started appearing from Su Guaning's time, and continued on during Bertil Anderson. The whole notion of how NTU is a teaching university changed somewhere from 2005 onwards, with relentless prioritisation given to research and making teaching duties an add-on responsibility. Nothing wrong with that. But for a self-proclaiming World Class University, that aspires to attract Undergrads, they need to put much more effort to anchoring back NTU into a student-centric University.\"},\n",

The Hive starts from level B5 to level 3, 8 floors in total, and has 3 lifts servicing the whole building. There\\'s a few entrance points for the Hive but most common is the one at B4 and B5. However, I\\'ve come across various times where lessons are held on level 2 or level 3, which is at the very top, but when you enter the building from level B4 or B5 and attempt to take the lifts you instead end up taking the stairs. The lifts are ancient and move very slow. Whenever we attempt to take the lifts, they are either full or move very slowly, which is why it would be faster to just take the stairs. My friends and I have concluded that NTU only invested into the design of the building and not the lifts. Before anyone says strawberry or entitled, think \"Would you want to go climbing 6-8 flights of stairs for your lessons while carrying your bags and laptop, especially when most often your rushing to your next lesson in Hive from another building.\"'},\n",

The management was terribly bad at handling and reacting fast in Mar/April last year that staff had to come to work everyday despite the govt informing of WFH arrangements. The solution to them was to segregate the office and separate each team but we were still seeing each other for meetings in the same building. It really depends how good each of the schools' leadership were and that their policies differs. Some staff were made to work alternate days but others were made to come everyday. The lack of quality and empathetic leaders, and the outdated mindset of staff who have been too long in the company and refuse to make catalytic changes, along with elite circle of Profs in their own clique, are some of the reasons why the administration has failed in some ways and it translates to an unpleasant experience for all.\"},\n",

When the pandemic happened, my batch was asked (ordered) by the program officer to come back to Singapore else the internship will not be credited. I am an international student (the only international student in that batch of China internship program) and I do not have another home here in SG. A week before I came back (i.e., right after we are ordered), I wrote an email to HAS if I could have a hostel to stay in once I reached Singapore. No reply from HAS, and the program officer said she will check with HAS. I have sent few emails to HAS before the departure date from China. Till the departure day, I received no response from HAS. I was anxious as it was quite hard to even rent a room outside of NTU at that time. I came back on the 1st of February and the pandemic was not as serious as in March. Hence, I was not issued with a SHN. Even though I was not issued with a SHN, I went straight to the quarantine facilities in NTU (Graduate Hall 1, GH1) as I had no place to go. Within the two weeks stay in GH1, I emailed (no reply) and phone called HAS (The officer said she will see what she can do) numerous times. The 2 weeks stay came to an end and HAS had yet to get back to me. I asked the quarantine officer if I could stay a few more days in GH1 until HAS get back to me and the answer is no. I was left with no choice but to rent a place outside at a shady HDB (The owner did not register me at HDB and the unit itself is compartmentalized into 8 rooms) (I did not know that the owner had to register me at that time). However, I am still glad that someone agreed to rent me a place considered that I just came back from China. The best part was after I moved out from GH1, the quarantine facilities officer called me, saying that I have a bill for quarantining myself at GH1 (S$530++). The room at GH1 was great but the food supplied was terrible (sometimes with uncooked chicken). I did not complain during my stay in GH1 as I thought the stay was free. I raised this issue to NTU management and I just got a reply saying that he will look into this matter. :/\\n\\nThis was a very bad experience of mine with NTU (especially HAS).\\n\\nHowever, my school's management (and lecturers) are decent. The overseas program officer has no plan or suggestion at all on what's next for students like me but SCBE's course coordinator responded quickly and advised me on what I could do next. CAO also helped me a lot at securing a local internship. (If I am not mistaken, Ms. Ho was the person who handled my case, thanks Ms. Ho).\\n\\nOverall, I have close to zero issues with SCBE's lecturers as they are often helpful to the students. They take student's suggestions into considerations for their teachings and decisions. Most of them are very happy to offer extra hours to help students with their assignments and projects.\\n\\nOf course, there are still some mods that gave me bad experience (Unorganized notes and bad teaching, i.e., lecturer reading 1-to-1 whatever is written on notes w/o further explanation). My worst memory was a mod (Engineering Math) from a lecturer from SPMS. His accent is so bad that I gave up attending his class at all after the first lesson and studied entirely myself from the Internet. To be fair, I don't completely put the blame on the lecturer as he was trying his best too (but still...). These issues are still manageable for me (as I know where to search for the study materials) but I don't think my peers are happy with those lecturers.\\n\\nThese are the things that came to my mind for now. Will add on if I remember anything else.\\n\\nSorry for the bad English :X.\"},\n",

NTU does suffer in some aspects but much better than NUS in my overall experience.\\n\\nI had to switch schools because I was in engineering and I wanted to do psychology. I can tell you that ntu is a lot more caring towards its students than NUS. What makes me say that?\\n\\n1) Ntu Dean and head of department cares more than NUS. When I wanted to transfer course, I got rejected twice. Later I found out from my student advisor that it was for \"KPI reasons\". My only other option was to go to ntu. Not only that, I had to take leave of absence for health reasons. Not once in my nus course did I hear anything from the Dean or professors. In ntu they actually arranged a meeting with me to see how else they can support me and assist me in returning to my studies \\n\\n2) Ntu cares more for mental well-being than NUS (I can\\'t say for physical because both wait times are abyssmal). I got an appointment much faster and they actually called to see which counsellor was best fit to my situation. Nus just sent me a last minute email expecting me to turn up in 1 hour.\\n\\n3) professors care more about you in ntu. In NUS, profs were often \"I didn\\'t teach this segment you go find the dipstick who did\". Granted this wasn\\'t their job but ntu profs were still willing to go through even though they taught different segments of the course. \\n\\n4) The admin staff were also more supportive overall. Email responses to staff (and profs) didn\\'t take three working days.\\n\\n5) Internship ntu staff were also amazing. I got a no-allowance internship on my own and so there was no need to support me. But they found a scheme which allowed me to get some allowance in the end.\\n\\nOf course they aren\\'t perfect. Before my transfer I had to submit some documents. But due to my leave of absences I didn\\'t have (nor do I need) certain documents.\\n\\n1) the admin staff in charge of admissions kept asking me for said documents (6-7 times) and I kept responding if it\\'s needed since I didn\\'t have it. He said he would check before getting back to me. He didn\\'t. And he asked for it AGAIN. \\n\\nGranted I know these are my experiences, but I just want to highlight that I personally find NTU felt much more amazing than my experiences in NUS.'},\n",

       "    'comment': \"I'm an EEE student going into my 4th year from AY2021-2022. You're absolutely right.\\n\\nThe modules (in engineering at least) have outdated content. For some of the core engineering modules, I can even use lecture notes and tutorials from year 2010.\\n\\nThe pedagogy is also extremely worthless. It encourages students to cram theories and spam tutorials to pass exams. Because most modules don't allow cheatsheet at all, we're forced to memorize formulas needlessly. \\n\\nThe practical component of the modules is either nonexistent or insignificant, so we end up producing engineering graduates who can't use oscilloscopes, write code or use solder. It's just a token inclusion into our curriculum so NTU can show that their curriculum is holistic.\\n\\nI've looked through the NUS curriculum and I still regret not choosing NUS instead. Even though EE may not be the forte of NUS, their modules are so modern and interesting.\\n\\nAnd don't get me started on how bad the social environment is. EEE is a dumping ground due to low entry requirement, and it's reflected in the students' attitude towards academics. For example, I've had a group mate who started to work on their part of class presentation at 7 am when the class was at 10 am, because she went drinking with her hall friends overnight. The majority are just here to cruise through life, so it's also extremely difficult to find people who want to go above and beyond their curriculum and partake in events like hackathons.\"},\n",

The S/U tool is meant to be used to allow people to take modules that they might be interested in, but not confident of doing well.

Two bus stops between them and I'm supposed to teleport over in an instant. We literally spent the whole year being late for that second class and nothing was changed despite many complaints. This happened to quite a few other people in my year.\\n\\nAnd when it came to money they were so cheapskate on many student activities and always were finding new ways to charge us for stuff. The craziest thing is during my time there they made record profits, bought two additional (and unnecessary) campus buildings in Central London and then had the gall to try and fire more than a hundred research staff! The backlash was so huge they only ended up firing less than half of them but it was still messed up.\\n\\nI also think almost all uni online grade checking systems are crap.

Is housing not a basic need? How tone deaf can the administration be? Yes, I get that hostels, to a certain extent, are a privilege but this is more nuanced than that. It came with a promise and a responsibility for taking care of our students yet they fail to note that part.\\n\\nIt is even more ironic that they caused this big fiasco in the name of covid and fulfilling the 2-year guarantee for freshmen. Nothing wrong with using halls as a marketing tool, but something is definitely off when you're sacrificing your current students / breaking other promises just to keep their own promise to someone else.

Changing the duration of the quiz at the last minute, giving shitty slides with ramble-y and technical lecture videos and super vague grading criteria for projects etc. To make things worse, his quizzes are all in MCQ but done online, so there was a whole lot of cheating going on. i emailed the Dean about this but all i got was 'sorry for your experience, but it has already been marked fairly.'\"},\n",

Again as a student or employee, I am inclined to interpret it as better management -- I was there for a year and it was truly different, even very different from the public universities. Is it just because their endowment funds are larger and thus they do not need to act niggardly and thus have better management?

Fine, I'll just move them to elsewhere to sell, same polluting manufacturing process, different place to turn it into money.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>if we reduce the need to travel to work, we can also reduce the consumption of fuel, plus much more, such as a reduced use of air conditioning in offices, and a reduced wear and tear of tires.\\n\\nI'm not sure if WFH will really reduce energy usage overall, working at home using laptops with wifi still uses energy, nothing is stopping people from using air-con at home, sure energy usage in office will fall but wouldn't that make it a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>such as buying less clothes, going vegan, and not going for cruises,\\n\\ngoing vegan - so if we stop importing meat, does that mean we have to import way more vegetables to make up for the shortfall in nutrition that we formerly get from meat?  then what will happen to the demand for vegetables? Will we need to import way more vegetables to keep prices stable?  Will our food supply be less resilient if there are disruption because we counted out meat as our option? Also will cold storage be an issue? Frozen meat can last for months but not every vegetable can be frozen, chilled vegetables can only last for days before no one will find it appetizing. And how will the F&B adapt? Only veggie burgers available in fast food? How about restaurants? Hawker centers? How will they have to change their menu when they have to take out all the meat?\\n\\nnot going for cruises - 1 less option for people to have fun, cruise companies will exit Singapore since there is no money to be made here which means fewer companies to tax which brings me to the next point ...\\n\\nbuying less clothes (or things in general) - one consequence of buying less things is getting less taxes, whether is it from GST or businesses, how big of an impact will it be on Singapore's budget? I don't know but I certainly hope it doesn't affect the way we fund projects that mitigate effects of climate change in the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLook, I know you are worried about the way we live as Singaporeans is affecting the climate and I agree the way we live isn't sustainable.

But what I can do is reduce my consumption of meat and gradually to move to \"energy efficient\" meat. For example, instead of having meat for my lunch and dinner everyday, I can slowly change to meat to one meal a day then slowly change to meat 3 times a week. At the mean time, I move from beef to pork and chicken, as they are less energy intensive to raise.\\n\\nLifestyle adjustments can be as simple as choosing to purchase more long lasting clothing brands than to support brands that engage in fast fashion (Like H&M and Zara), and try to make your clothes more long lasting like turning them inside out and put them inside a wash bag before washing them in the washing machine. Or avoiding taking using single use plastic like straws, utensils, plastic water bottle and plastic bag. \\n\\nSome nice to own items are bo bian, like laptops and hand phones because we use them beyond entertainment. We can do simple things, instead of upgrading your phone every year, make it every 2 to 3 years. Laptops, just make sure you do device maintenance every 6 months, like cleaning the fans, this can drastically increase your laptop\\'s usability.\\n\\nTo be honest, I\\'m fine if the cruise industry is reduce or stop being supported given how much pollution they produced. Unlike smaller nations which depends on hoards of tourism from cruise, our main breadwinner, is still banking, services and high value manufacturing. We also don\\'t earn much from them, especially their main source of profits is gambling and we already have two very profitable casinos here.\\n\\nWe can adapt to a certain extent, but the animals and the environment cannot. The IPCC has already stated this a Code Red event, that can threatened human survival, I don\\'t know about you but if eating less appealing food and reducing consumption versus the potential collapse of human civilisation, I would pick the former.

You are basing your assumptions on the fact that everyone goes to the CBD to work, which is clearly not the case. As you said yourself- Jurong is a heavily industrialised area, and it will become even more populated with workers in the future when the port of SG gets moved there. And the comparison of Tuas to Punggol is not justified as well. Air pollution in Punggol is a result of our neighbours to the north, not our own factories. [There are no major manufacturing plants in Singapore, meaning that a vast amount of air pollution is caused by transboundary pollution.](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/industrial/2019/11/06/is-there-industrial-pollution-in-singapore-2/) This isn't a problem with Tuas because the region of Malaysia that borders the western side of Singapore is relatively rural compared to JB and Pasir Gudang.\\n\\n[Additionally, NEA constantly monitors the air around Jurong/Tuas and have found that ambieng air quality there is normal, and any weird smells are not harmful.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/parliament-smells-emitted-from-factories-in-jurong-industrial-area-not-harmful)\\n\\nI agree with you on the basis that Tanah Merah golf course is not a good place to build BTOs. But not for your basis of it being too far from the CBD. The 50000 workers at Changi Airport or the other few ten thousand people workers in the surrounding Loyang Industrial Region and Changi Biz Park would love to live in this area because it's so near. Rather, building BTOs at Tanah Merah Country Club is unviable because of one main reason. It's directly in the path of Changi Airport's runways and thus any BTO's constructed there must be super low. Additionally, the noise pollution caused will be unbearble just like you said.\"},\n",

Just because its a prime location for housing doesn\\'t diminish its ecological value. I would like to also point out that a HDB environmental baseline study found that \"Dover Forest is home to at least 158 species of animals - including critically endangered ones - and 120 plant species\", thus making it a \\'prime location\\' for conservation. Please consider its ecological value (along with its potential landuse/housing value) before committing to a decision to clear the forest.  \\n\\n\\n2. I have asked my conscience, and it told me that a housing ballot is not the best way to promote social mobility. Targeted measures for lower income groups such as HDB grants and subsidies are a much better way. It is wishful thinking to assume that the lower income groups will magically be able to ballot successfully for these hypothetically highly popular housing flats, given the huge demand by non-lower income groups and even the more well to do demographics. Also, by extension of your logic, Toto/4D is a magic bullet for social mobility (ask your conscience if this is right).  \\n\\n\\n3. Conservation of forests is non-mutually exclusive. Conserving Dover Forest will not necessarily cause Clementi Forest to be cleared (although I admit it may have some influence), or vice versa. We can both care about Dover Forest and Clementi Forest, as well as Tengah, or any other area of ecological and conservation value. If you keep plucking the lowest hanging fruit you will eventually have a fruitless tree.  \\n\\n\\n4. I\\'m glad that you are trying to apply your understanding of physics and the principle of conservation of energy, but it is not as simple as that. Did you conduct a study on the travel patterns of the demography of Dover? Did you consider the proximity of their workplaces (and the potential Jurong CBD)? Did you conduct a quantitative study on how much in terms of energy costs you would save by building BTO in Dover as opposed to Tengah/Tuas, and whether this amount would be significant enough to offset the non-tangible value of ecological services and residents\\' perceived value of green spaces? Without these, you cannot definitively conclude that \"saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes\".  \\n\\n\\nI propose a simple thought experiment: assuming the trains run on a constant schedule, how much energy/transport costs do you save if you board the train at Dover instead of Pioneer, given that your destination is Raffles Place?  \\n\\n\\n5. I don\\'t know enough about the property market to comment on whether or not the value of private homes in the area will be depressed over time.

       "    'comment': '>**1. Why don\\'t we stop importing foreigners?**  \\n>  \\n>First of all, if I\\'m not wrong, purely foreign households cannot buy HDBs, so stopping the import of foreigners isn\\'t going to make any difference in this case. Maids live with Singaporean households, and foreign workers live in dormitories. So they aren\\'t exactly contributing to the spike in the domestic public housing demand, are they? **(Mic drop)**\\n\\nThis is absolutely incorrect. Foreigners do contribute to demand for public housing. Let me explain why.\\n\\nFirstly, not all foreign workers live in dormitories. We have roughly 1.7 million non-residents living in Singapore and only about 300k people living in dormitories. Obviously, most foreigners (workers, students and dependents) do NOT live in dormitories even if you take away the foreign domestic workers (around 230k). So, the remaining million or so non-residents living in Singapore have to live somewhere. Even if they cannot buy HDB units, they do contribute to the **demand** for it.\\n\\nSecondly, whole HDB flats can rented out to foreigners. In fact, HDB\\'s [own statistics](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/renting-out-a-flat-bedroom/renting-out-your-flat/rental-statistics) do show that the number of whole HDB units rented out increased from 15,137 in 2009 to 48,195 in 2019, **more than tripling over the last decade**. The implications for this are that there are almost 50k Singapore households who no longer live in the public housing but hold onto their flat to earn rental income while living elsewhere. This means that there are 50k possible **spare** units that could have been released to the HDB resale market but the owners (who, may I remind you, are already living elsewhere) have not decided to sell them because they are subletted out, most likely to foreign workers or students. In effect, these HDB units are used as **investment properties** and the owners are acting as **landlords**.\\n\\nIf you restrict whole HDB units from being subletted or reduce the number of units leased out, you reduce the demand for HDB units for use as an investment property. The owners/landlords are likely to sell them away and increase the supply of HDB units on the resale market market, lowering their resale price and making them more affordable to resident buyers (citizens and PRs). One way to reduce the demand for HDB flats as investment properties is to do something about Singapore\\'s non-resident population.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>**2. It is a way to promote social mobility.**  \\n>  \\n>Many people do like the lottery effect, which such rare BTOs provides, for it is the only easy shot for such lower-income people to achieve social mobility.\\n\\nThis assumption that lower-income people go for BTOs in mature estates is... highly questionable. BTO units in mature estates are priced substantially higher than your average BTO in a non-mature estate, usually beyond the reach of \"lower-income people\".'},\n",

       "    'comment': 'I’ve addressed the masterplan before. There are numerous plots of land in equally prime areas in the vicinity but they remain empty for almost a decade. No matter how hard you try to justify the reasons that we need space for housing, it doesn’t address the fact that these plots of land have been empty, unused for years. \\n\\nSure they are planned for housing. That’s the keyword. It’s only planned on paper and nothing more. One of them has even been reallocated from residence to become an expansion for an industrial park. This means that there are no solid plans for residential use at all. It’s merely an earmark. (If you deal with HDB and other agencies you’ll find this is a common practice - announce first, plan in detail later, in this case even a decade later nothing is planned) So the question now is: if you tear down a forest while there’s still available land, which do you use first? The vacant land while your forest is destroyed? Or use the forested land while other land remains vacant? Either way you spin it, it will all come back to saying that there is _no urgent need_ for the land to be repurposed for residences. That has been the core reason of this debate. If we really need housing spaces that badly, sure take the forest down. But if you take time to understand how the government agencies work and pay attention to the deeper details, you’ll see it’s not the case. \\n\\n“We need them for emergencies like covid temporary dorms”\\n\\nYes and no. We can see from the covid response already, not a single one of the plots of land in the vicinity were used. Instead they look towards large exhibition areas, vacated HDB blocks that haven’t been torn down yet, etc because it’s cheaper to repurpose them. And if this argument is true, we should just open up a new category “emergency use” instead of allocating it for residences. Because we have to be prepare for emergency all the time right? This spare land might as well be permanently left empty. Just like how you can leave a forested land permanently under nature reserve and leave it the f alone.'},\n",

Some of the replies haven't be exactly polite and constructive without being aggressive, but don't be disheartened!\\n\\nI do find flaws in some of your arguments that I can briefly touch on. We could continue to have more in-depth discussions if you are willing to.\\n\\n>**It is a way to promote social mobility.**\\n\\nThis is a rather huge claim. Social mobility is really a huge issue. Having a bunch of new houses from establishing new residential estates will influence that is really questionable.\\n\\nAnd simply owning a good value house doesn't necessarily mean one can move up the social strata. There are so many unpredictable factors at play to lead to that eventual conclusion that without any substantiation, one would not be readily convinced.\\n\\n>**Saving this forest destroys other forests**\\n\\nOne forest is not necessarily mutual exclusive to another.\\n\\nDevelopmental plans are specific to site conditions, such as topography, soil types and stability, nearby infrastructure, height restrictions, GPR etc. All of these might not be the same at another site and hence a certain kind of development might not be suitable elsewhere. This claim might be true for some, but to generalize it for all forests is again, a very huge claim.\\n\\nBoth this and other forests could be destroyed, or both could be preserved, the fate of one isn't always dependent on the fate of another.\\n\\n>**Saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes.**\\n\\nFirstly, not all people work in CBD. Secondly, the trains and buses will run regardless of whether some people from an estate use them or not. Lastly, how significant is having a new estate on the general commuting patterns islandwide?\\n\\nLooking at the above,  I would say maybe your claim is valid, but most probably not significant   at all to be considered a benefit.\\n\\n>**Preserving this forest benefits the wealthy; destroying it reduces class segregation.**\\n\\nAgain, this sounds like a really huge claim. I don't deny that this could be a rich problem, an opposite of the NIMBY problem, but you are creating a false 'us vs them' argument here.\\n\\nIs it really only the wealthy benefitting? There are also not so wealthy people living near. To what extent can one curb class segregation simply with establishing a new estate?\\n\\n>**Environmental and heritage conservation, they are often in conflict with each other.**\\n\\nThat's a false dichotomy. Environmental and heritage conservation can always come hand in hand. It is highly context dependent, on what kind of environment impacts and what kind of heritage.\\n\\nFor example, Botanical Gardens. One could argue that heritage is preserved through the preservation of certain trees and historical elements, while the environment is also conserved because well, it became a park.\\n\\n>By destroying a part of the forest, you maximize the number of Singaporeans who can enjoy the lowered temperatures that the forest's remaining sections provide.\\n\\nI'm afraid that's not how Urban Heat Island works.\\n\\nWith reduced forest size, the capacity to absorb heat by the forest is greatly reduced. And also now on the original forested land, you have concrete which traps way more heat than any other natural material. So would the forest's remaining sections really still provide lower temperatures to the surrounding? I highly doubt so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs someone studying and working on urban planning, it's nice to see people like you trying to understand things a little deeper. Don't be too demoralized by the comments ! Keep it up!\"},\n",

If it is able to sustain it, then the animals living in the east side should be capable of making do with what remains in the western section.\\n\\nSecondly, what you mention of animals other than migratory birds making use of the forest connectivity, that concerns me. From what I know, there aren’t any eco links that bridges the forests together like the one along BKE. And I don’t think animals are smart enough to make use of overhead bridges. I may be wrong, monkeys can be pretty smart. But if those animals do make use of the connectivity, wouldn’t there be a lot of roadkills between the forests by now?\\n\\nAnd now, last point on urban heat island effect. That would be an argument for saving bigger forests like Tengah, Simpang, or even Clementi over Dover, since bigger = better. Dover doesn’t really have a lot of depth to it. Of course, that’s based on an assumption on my part which I would like to challenge: what is the minimum forest size where the urban heat island effect is considerably alleviated?'},\n",

But I can speak in terms of probability. The probability that a workplace (even if it is not a CBD) is nearer to a person is pretty high in Dover than in Tengah, in terms of travelling time. Perhaps Tuas will be closer to Tengah than Dover. But one-north, Ubi, Jurong East, and Tampines will be closer to Dover than Tengah. Perhaps not by a lot, but by some. You will need more fuel to get to those places by car. Of course it’s worth noting that if you work in Pasir Ris it’s unlikely that you choose to live in Dover.

       "    'comment': 'Hi. Some of the arguments are much stronger than the other. Especially the one on transport. Let me address your concerns.\\n\\n1) I will define prime location to be a location which holds a certain level of convenience and prestige that most Singaporeans do not get to reside in. Generally, that means that while there may be other prime locations that aren’t near MRT stations, those which are near MRT stations and aren’t on the far ends of Singapore are prime locations. Dover is a prime location. You have exclusive landed properties up north affording a certain level of prestige, and easy connectivity to the city down south.\\n\\n2) BTO as social mobility is indeed a joke. But as flawed as it is, it is still a mode of social mobility. If we have less of this, we must not forget to have more of something else. Lower-income people stand to have a chance to benefit from it. By the way, in this case I define lower-income people very broadly, it is people who cannot afford landed properties. This includes middle-income households living in 5-room HDBs or small condominium apartments. Maybe I should have cleared the miscommunication out. Those people would be relatively poor compared to those owning freehold landed properties.\\n\\n3) Clearing Dover forest provides zero guarantees but it provides more reasons to support whatever that is left. If we try to conserve everything, we will end up conserving nothing. The government will just proceed to chop the remaining trees and ignore the pleas because there’s no sense of which to prioritise and which to not.\\n\\n4) Even if we assume that people work elsewhere, like one-north, Ubi, Paya Lebar, or Jurong East, the effect of the commutes average out such that an average commute from Dover is shorter than that in say Tengah. Of course, people tend to live closer to where they work. But that’s not always the case. There are people whose workplace is in the wrong end of Singapore, in relation to their place of residence. And for those kind of people, living closer to the CBD or Circle Line is beneficial to them.\\n\\n5) It is all the more a reason to support the destruction of Dover forest because the rich benefits more from its preservation. And society stands to benefit from less class segregation if a more diverse class of people live there.\\n\\nNow to the second part.\\n\\n1) In that case then I’m sorry that many Singaporeans with a foreigner/PR parent like me are to be blamed for being not true-blue enough.\\n\\n2) The argument still applies even if not everyone works in the CBD. See above.\\n\\n3) I guess you have a point? But still, we know that it will eventually happen.\\n\\n4) If you consider them to be exceptions, then man there are plenty of exceptions to make. Commonwealth. West Coast. Circuit Road. Tiong Bahru. Clementi. Toa Payoh. Boon Keng. Each has its own story, and hold memories to many. En-bloc destroys entire communities and causes a cultural genocide, especially when it comes to HDBs.\\n\\n5) To determine whether this argument is bizarre or not I will need to ask you the minimum forest size where there is still a significant urban heat island effect on the surroundings. If it is larger than Dover forest, then that’s not a reason to preserve Dover forest. If it is smaller than Dover forest, it is justification to axe certain parts of the forest to maximise the amount of people who can benefit from such an effect.'},\n",

After all, it’s just difficult to focus on many plots at once. While the spotlight is on Dover which hasn’t even started deforestation, we have deforestation on Tengah, Gali Batu, Kranji, Lentor, Yishun, Punggol, Tampines North, Bedok South, Lim Chu Kang, et cetera. Indeed those places have been irrevocably changed and will never turn into what it used to be again. But there’s still places which shouldn’t be taken for granted, like Simpang. And we know that many of those parcels of land falls near an airbase, and will not be utilised to the same degree as if Dover is used instead, given lower gross plot ratios.\\n\\nThat’s where I’m coming from when I say, “saving a forest destroys another forest”. Not that it’s mutually exclusive, but that the public has a really small attention span, and concentrating too much or tunnel-visioning on one forest when there are other bigger, more ecologically and environmentally useful ones out there being neglected and secretly demolished, won’t help to combat climate change in the most optimal manner. All that is would be virtue signalling, and that’s all.

Surely that means we should try to conserve each and every single individual of that species? These species are already at risk of extinction - which is all the more reason why we should ensure its diversification in locations, by maintaining its numbers/presence in dover. We don't want a situation where we have all of our endangered species concentrated in one or two locations, like the nature reserves. Not only does it severely limit the gene pool and promote inbreeding, once a disease strikes, that's it for the species. So yes, I daresay that the loss of Dover may *potentially* result in the loss of the endangered species.\\n\\nYou might say to just relocate the endangered wildlife to other forested areas. Well yes, but how sure are you that the animals will be able to adapt, reproduce, and thrive successfully in their new habitat? And again, this links back to my point abt diversification of gene pool by having the species be spread across various territories.\\n\\n>The area being explicitly marked for development dwarfs Dover forest’s size, yet I don’t see anyone getting as agitated in wanting those areas to be preserved.\\n\\nSimple reason, there wasn't the media hype, wasn't reported in mainstream media outlets.

Admittedly aside from people jumping on the bandwagon, there are also people who care just enough about conservation to defend Dover forest, but not enough to find out abt other issues that's not reported as widely. I can say in all honesty that I'm the latter, so I wasn't aware of this before you pointed it out. Still, it's a step forward in awareness.\\n\\n>And by preserving Dover, we increase the pressure to demolish and develop those plots. Is it really a better option?\\n\\nWho knows?

It also serves as a stopover point for migratory birds on the East-Asian Australasian Flyway, according to the NSS, meaning it's important for allowing raptors like sparrowhawks as well as smaller passerine birds a place to recover after a fairly arduous journey.\\n\\nThe flora found there isn't too commin either.

In fact, as some other commenters have mentioned, this is , at least to a certain degree, the result of the bandwagon effect. \\n\\nThe disproportionate amount of attention on this specific plot, which undeniably has relatively less value compared to other forests, made this whole 'conservation' thing very questionable. Not that there are no environmentalists out there truly concerned, but how many amongst all those who commented truly care about nature? \\n\\nThen again, it's not necessarily a bad thing. More attention on one can bring people's attention to the wider topic and other areas (hopefully), and spark debates and discussions, which is evident here in this thread of yours. \\n\\n>  That’s where I’m coming from when I say, “saving a forest destroys another forest”. Not that it’s mutually exclusive, but that the public has a really small attention span, and concentrating too much or tunnel-visioning on one forest when there are other bigger, more ecologically and environmentally useful ones out there being neglected and secretly demolished, won’t help to combat climate change in the most optimal manner \\n\\nI see. Indeed. With land scarcity around, choices are really limited. The balance between development and conservation is very intricate, and people are spending their whole lives dedicated to it. Maybe it's possible to have no forests cleared in Singapore from now on, but the costs, the impacts, the price of alternative solutions, are we capable of handling them? \\n\\nUrban planning, which could also include the public transport planning which you are interested in, is really complex. More often than not, it's about trade-offs, sacrifices, compromises. Everything comes at a cost. Ultimately, the discussion should not be simply about how bad one decision is, but rather, what are the pros and cons of this decision versus another, what is the value of this land use versus another. Truth is, nothing is truly equal in this world, somethings naturally have higher value than another. \\n\\nYes there is irreplaceable value in a secondary forest, but how does it compare with a primary forest?  Yes the land can be left as it is and develop somewhere else, but how does it compare with developing here instead? \\n\\n**Always plucking the lowest hanging fruit will inevitably result in having no fruit at all in the future, but not plucking ANY fruit right now and you wouldn't even survive to see tomorrow.**\"},\n",

It is doubtful that they even nest there as the EIA records them as flying over the patch. Grey herons make huge nests high up in the tree and it would be extremely obvious if they were there. The smaller birds listed were listed as being seen flying over the site. As for reptiles and amphibians, green crested lizards won't magically go extinct if Dover forest is destroyed. Asian softshell turtles may even be someone's unwanted pet. If destroying Dover forest means less encroachment on nature reserves, it is a sacrifice we have to take. The ideal scenario of course is no more encroachment anywhere from now on and instead a focus on forest succession (Dover, being part of the nutirent poor Southern Ridges and an abandoned rubber plantation, can never succeed into a mature secondary forest like in the CCNR and will instead become Adinandra belukar forest like in Kent Ridge) and connectivity (even so, Dover's position barely connects it to anywhere given the relatively poor biodiversity of the Southern Ridges) but let's be real URA would never let that happen.\"},\n",

There are some basis, otherwise I wouldn’t be quoting sources here and there in the main passage. Anyways, with regards to my opinion on transportation, my stand is derived from what I observed in a few datasets from the LTA Datamall API a couple of years back. People who live further away from the city commute further, on average. Did some basic calculations with the carbon footprint of an average public bus, train or private cars and how many big trees there are in Dover with Google Maps. The data is probably fairly inaccurate, but the numbers doesn’t look very good for me. I don’t have the resources myself, but it is what it is.\\n\\nAnyways, it is easy to disprove a point. It can be difficult to prove a point to the point where there is no way to rebut at all. That I agree. Otherwise, we won’t have people who have to spend their lives in fields like geography and urban environment. That’s why when I see opinions of biologists and urban planners in here, I take their opinions much more seriously. Because they know a lot more things that I don’t.\\n\\nAlso, the last paragraph is a terrible misrepresentation of what this unpopular opinion is for. It is a straw man argument.

       "    'comment': 'Which is why people pointed out the fallacies in your arguments. \\n\\nTo me personally, once you refer to the lottery of getting a BTO, I feel you immediately lose credibility. There is a supposed backlog of applications for BTOs. Why would Dover magically solve this? It hinges on the idea that some people will get it and thereby become enriched because they can sell for a lot after MOP is done.\\n\\nBut that isn’t social mobility. It’s literally a lottery. You have no way to ensure that the BTOs will go to those that actually need it. Also, those really poor? They actually can’t afford BTOs. So you’re still ignoring that subset. What you’re actually trying to promote is a lottery for the middle class. \\n\\nHave you even been to the area? If you see the responses about the large plot of land in Ghim Moh, I know exactly where that is. Why would you want another large forest to be torn down and become a literal field? \\n\\nAnd this idea of everyone wanting to live centrally is also flawed because not everyone works in the city centre. I know a doctor couple that loves living in Upper Bukit Timah (so not the expensive part) because their clinic they work at is in the west. That also applies to other people who work in the West. The same thinking would also apply to those that work in the East or any other part of Singapore that is outside of the city centre to be honest. But it’s easy to forget that because most younger ones seem to want to work in the city centre, which I suppose makes sense, but ignores reality.'},\n",

Do we allow people to speak freely or have fear that they will be hit with governmental interference such as POFMA, do we really want our Constitution to be amended easily (because that is how it is right now) and do we want to allow people who are “different” to feel as if they are not prejudiced against. \\n\\nIt’s not as if the Govt can ignore the bread and butter issues like the economy and jobs because that would constitute a complete and utter failure on their part. If they didn’t even handle that, they would be in trouble. But just handling those issues alone constitutes a passing grade in my book, not a good or great grade.'},\n",

They do not take into account the other factors and hence seem like a very simplistic overview. It may sound good listing them out, but you need comparisons. \\n\\nWhy did they build this, was it built before the need arose or is it just fighting fires constantly?\\n\\nHere are some things to think about.\\n\\nPioneer generation package, 9 billion. How much has been disbursed? \\n\\nSame with merdeka generation package. What is the comparison?\\n\\nChas card for chronic illnesses. How much do you think someone gets from this? For a chronic illness, you would spend somewhere between $600 to $3000 a year on drugs, consultation, treatment, etc As a diabetic, i looked into this, i can get $28 for the whole year.\\n\\nHospitals & polyclinics are still overcrowded, tried to get an appointment at a polyclinic lately? Or a hospital bed? The fastest wait for my aged parents was 12hrs, this was in feb this year. How long have we had a shortage of hospital beds? Since before the last election.\\n\\n$8 heart surgery... i needed an mri scan, used my medisave. You can only use $300 for a scan that costs $1300. Specialist at sgh, $400, cannot use medisave. The battery of blood & urine tests, cannot use medisave. Getting results of those tests, $100. Cannot use medisave. \\n\\nPaying to get your test results....think about that. I get an annual check up at my gp, all in $200 plus. \\n\\nGST, many countries with gst do not tax basic goods like rice, flour, bread, sugar, oil. We tax everything. And its not a flat 7% tax. By the time you buy something, how much tax has been paid?\\nDistributor brings in product x for $100. Gst $7.\\nDealer buys it for $150. Gst $10.50\\nConsumer buys it for $200. Gst $14.\\n\\nEducation - we spend millions on foreign students. But we don\\'t have enough for our own students? We have things like the pocket money fund, raised from our citizens, but the govt pay for foreigners? We don\\'t have enough places in local universities for singaporeans, so instead of making more available, we bring in FTs to plug the gaps? That does not make sense. Could the courses not be enlarged? Could more courses be offered? \\n\\nTransport - the govt studied HK\\'s MTR system before building our own mrt. \\n\\nThe mrt was built to handle a population of around 3 million. It was also built without any plans to cater for our current population. \\n\\nHK runs 8 carriages per train, 5 doors per carriage. 40 doors\\nWe have 6 carriages per train, 4 doors per carriage. 24 doors.\\n\\nWhich will move more people? Can we add carriages to the trains now? Lengthen the platforms?\\n\\nBangkok also built a similar system, which is currently underutilised, they planned for 8 carriages & 5 doors. But currently only running at half capacity with 4 carriages.\\n\\nWho planned better?\\n\\nLRT - more firefighting. Poorly designed, poor quality, plagued with problems.\\n\\nAll that aside, no maintenance. \\n\\nAll the points above, where was the planning? \\n\\nSure, its not easy, but the govt is the highest paid in the world, as many have said. Does real madrid aim to be in the top 5? Man U? \\n\\nI was a pap supporter, i believed in them. But they\\'re just  trying to live off their glory days now. \\n\\nName 1 issue in the last 10 years that they solved, and did so well, that made you go \"wow\". \\n\\nNow can you think of any issue in the last 5 years that was badly managed?\\n\\n Too many things have gone bad, the pettiness, the fixing of opponents instead or problems, the \"i can, you cannot\", i can bring up the past, but you cannot.

The Supreme Court has to constantly change their interpretation of the constitution to keep up with developments in society). The question is are all changes valid and proper, and what is the right balance in parliament to ensure this. \\n\\nHence, Singaporeans have to decide what type of balance do they want. Do they believe that the ruling party will make valid changes to the constitution if given a supermajority, or do we need to have stronger opposition MPs to ensure that only necessary changes are required?

It means that Singaporeans are staying at home more, and doing what they need to do around their immediate neighbourhood.\\n\\n> \"This is not the time to use our public transport to get to the other side of Singapore for your favourite hawker dish.\\n\\n> \"When the Transport Minister had to suspend ERP (electronic road pricing) and COE (certificate of entitlement), and discourage the use of public transport, you know the situation is serious.\"\\n\\n> LTA told The Straits Times the demand for public transport has dropped by around 50 per cent since the start of the Covid-19 crisis.\\n\\n> The elevated set of safe distancing measures, including full home-based learning and the closure of most physical workplaces, that kick in from today till May 4, \"is expected to further lower ridership\".\\n\\n> Nominated MP Walter Theseira, an associate professor of economics at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said the anticipated further drop in ridership should be enough to allow safe distancing on buses and trains to happen.\\n\\n> With this, public transport operators will not be able to recover costs, he added. \"It\\'s clear that with these measures, train operators are going to need subsidies, and for buses, Government will see more losses.\"\\n\\n> In cities which have implemented \"lockdowns\" to combat the pandemic, public transport ridership figures had plunged by as much as 90-plus per cent, according to Israeli mobility app company Moovit last month. Two weeks ago, New York City cut back bus and train services as ridership plunged by as much as 90 per cent.\\n\\n> Meanwhile, Nominated MP Yip Pin Xiu suggested staggering school hours when home-based learning ends. This, she said, will avert the \"large crowds in trains and buses\" in the morning and when schools end.\\n\\n---\\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)'},\n",

Too little demand, they're better off taking taxis. Too much demand, (there should just be) a regular bus service.”\\n\\n> \\n\\n> NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM FOR ON-DEMAND BUSES\\n\\n> On-demand bus services exist in various cities worldwide, with varying degrees of success.\\n\\n> Kutsuplus, which began operating in Helsinki in 2013, ended operations after two years as the authorities deemed it too costly.\\n\\n> And in January Chariot, - which operated in various US cities and was owned by carmaker Ford - announced it was closing shop.\\n\\n> However, local start-up SWAT - part of the Goldbell engineering and transport group – says it still sees a future for on-demand bus services.\\n\\n> The firm has existing projects in Singapore, Australia, and Vietnam, and is expected to begin operations in Indonesia, The Philippines, Japan and China in the coming months.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> SWAT was one of two firms participating in the LTA's on-demand bus trial, with the other being United States-based Via.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> “With increasing congestion due to rapid urbanisation and infrastructure limitations, we believe that on-demand ride-pooling in buses is the way of the future,” said SWAT chief executive and co-founder Jarrold Ong.\\n\\n> He added that such services can provide efficient public transport in areas where traditional fixed bus routes are not viable.\\n\\n> The most successful roll-outs have been in providing first-and-last mile connections to train, metro and trunk bus lines, he noted.\\n\\n> Mr Ong noted that while SWAT’s primary focus is on working with governments to provide its services as part of public transport, as well as with companies for employee transport arrangements, it is also exploring other areas such as the use of autonomous vehicles.\\n\\n---\\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)\"},\n",

This measures the distance travelled before a train fault that lasts more than five minutes.\\n\\n> It is now time to extend the focus from immediate fixes to also include longer-term sustainability, he said.\\n\\n> On longer intervals between trains, Mr Khaw said there is scope for this during off-peak hours, and that he will encourage the rail operators to experiment with such measures in their train lines.\\n\\n> Matching of supply with demand \"should lead to better customer service\", he said.\\n\\n> Citing the example of Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR, which have train intervals of up to 10 and 14 minutes respectively during off-peak hours, he said: \"By adjusting train frequencies based on commuter demand, they optimise the use of resources.\\n\\n> \"This also reduces unnecessary wear and tear on the system that drive up downstream maintenance costs.\"\\n\\n> Currently, SMRT and SBST trains arrive at stations every five to seven minutes during off-peak hours.\\n\\n> Mr Khaw noted that longer intervals between trains is already the case for the Changi Airport and Tuas West Extension lines.\\n\\n> It is the same for bus services.\\n\\n> Cost-efficiency is another key area of focus, Mr Khaw said, adding that new efforts and initiatives by SMRT and SBST have led to total savings of more than $25 million.\\n\\n> One such initiative is an SMRT-developed simulator that allows the train operator to more effectively repair their tracks. SMRT said the machine, which was introduced in 2018, can reap about $70,000 worth of savings a year.\\n\\n> Train operators have, in recent years, expressed concerns about higher operating costs.\\n\\n> Related Story Vivian Balakrishnan explains what planners are doing to keep costs of transport system down\\n\\n> Related Story New rail facility in Tuas aims to reduce MRT line testing closures\\n\\n> In July, SMRT Trains reported mounting losses on the back of higher operating expenses. In the 12 months to end-March this year, losses hit $155 million - almost double from a year ago.\\n\\n> Spending on repairs and maintenance accounted for about 71 per cent of rail-fare revenue, up from just 45 per cent three years ago.\\n\\n> Meanwhile, SBS Transit\\'s Downtown Line has registered losses of $125 million over the past three years, while its train division also lost tens of millions of dollars.\\n\\n> The Transport Ministry had said that such losses were not sustainable and that higher fares would be needed in the face of rising subsidies for public transport.\\n\\n> Beyond cost savings, Mr Khaw said train operators are also looking to boost non-rail revenues.\\n\\n> The Land Transport Authority recently outsourced the rights for retail and advertising on the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) as part of efforts to improve the line\\'s financial sustainability.\\n\\n> This marks the first time non-fare businesses, which are currently run by MRT operators, have been outsourced.\\n\\n> The move is expected to bring over $164 million in concession fees for the LTA over the 16-year concession term.\\n\\n> Mr Khaw said: \"The two appointed non-fare operators are expected to bring in significantly more non-fare revenue per rider as compared to today.\\n\\n> \"Given this promising outcome, LTA is exploring how we can expand the outsourcing framework to other train lines.\"\\n\\n---\\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)'},\n",

       "    'comment': \"Singapore is obviously reactionary by the standards of the democratic socialists or Marxists. However, the Singapore government actually owns large swathes of the economy, which does count as 'social ownership' in Marxist and democratic socialist thought. In policymaking, the Singapore government often uses that market power as a lever. The government, however, embraces capitalist thought to reduce overreliance on welfare (maybe a little too much, but nowhere quite as bad as in the US). \\n\\nI think the fact that many policies are actually rather leftist is often ignored by the local populace, and is a really good observation that you made. The largest single source of government revenue, and hence the largest source of social policy funding, is actually not even taxation anymore; it is from government-linked corporations like singtel and sovereign wealth funds!\\n\\nTry putting that into a political alignment compass/spectrum. A government that funds social policy using socially owned means of production (leftist!), but also via a glorified hedge fund (state capitalist?). Singapore can even be argued to be slightly more socialist in this regard than, say, China after DXP but before the 21st Century, where the populace has essentially zero control over the means of production. In Singapore, state-owned enterprises do bend to popular pressure as the ministers need to remain electable, especially for companies like SMRT.\\n\\nOn the other hand, attracting foreign companies and promoting local startups directly via government grants seems distinctly capitalist. I think the Singaporean system is really rather unique and often (but not always) takes the best ideas from various sometimes contradictory schools of thought. I do really like your thoughts on the book! It really has always been kinda obvious in my mind that ideological purity isn't a desirable trait at all, and I don't understand why so many leftists and libertarians insist on it.\"},\n",

This isn\\'t like looking back at Winston Churchill (even though technically LKY did in this book) or Abraham Lincoln or even Alexander Hamilton - you are talking to a people who were within two degrees of this history playing out - either they lived through it themselves *or* their parents / older relatives did. For instance my father was in the second intake of the National Service (NS) that this book mentions - and that means that I could - and did - ask my father about his experience colored by the specific happenings in the book.   You have the benefit of being able to get to a ridiculous number of primary sources even if they\\'re not educated or computer-literate (which is... rare, given the impacts of the policies that LKY implemented). Goh Chok Tong, for instance. For reader comfort (especially if your reader is more familiar with complicated policies being simplified down to one person), I understand this tendency, but I would warn against *yourself* as the writer making this mistake.\\n\\nI also think that the character of the Singaporean people (both at the time and in the present) plays a very large though to-Westerners invisible part in the book - and it\\'s absent from this review. It\\'s mostly contextual, and that focusing on his policies and looking at numbers is, while valuable, in a way missing a very key point. LKY was very, very aware of his people\\'s character and ways of thinking, in part because he shared some of it himself - it\\'s in some of the quotes you mention, even. And so he and his ministers were able to reshape things around key levers that almost all of his population shared, even with the general diversity and race - there were some key commonalities that have come ahead now to define \"cliches\" and/or in some ways memes now in Singaporean culture...especially in the boomer generation, which is the generation that was born into and lived through his reshaping of the country.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to publish to Western audiences, I think it would be worthwhile to learn a bit more about this aspect - if you\\'re making *any* recommendations, say, for America to learn, you need the underlying context, too.\\n\\nEdit: I do really appreciate the research you put into the numbers and the observation of that continuous tinkering around the policies that LKY and his cabinet did, though - that\\'s a *very* good observation and useful for recommendations, because he doesn\\'t outright say it in his book - he\\'s a very paternal figure in a lot of ways, laying down The Law and all that.'},\n",

My impression was that people would retain more from the second option\\n\\nThat\\'s certainly fair enough - for a comprehensible read it\\'s a much easier thing to do and write about, *especially* given that - as someone else mentioned on this thread - LKY taking much of the credit was very much a public relations policy...especially to politicians in the West, hilariously enough... *because* it was easier for people to deal with him and his very blunt...LKYness as a known quantity, while allowing him to slip certain things by using his ministers when they were wheeling and dealing. Which I suppose indicates another point of his remarkable leadership, and his ability to delegate. On the other hand, there\\'s already a lot of scholarship about LKY, and not so much about the other very important leaders, so I\\'m not sure that narrowing the focus that much more is that good a thing - from a recent Western source at that (recent as in whenever you publish this). Perhaps a brief introduction at some point about those other leaders and/or in an appendix, and then simply mentioning those names as influences underscoring LKY\\'s leadership?\\n\\nNote that there is a significant if qualified reaction against LKY in Singapore culture - you can see that on this thread itself - so any attempt at glorifying him to a Western audience is going to run up against significant backlash from Singaporeans (which, given our diaspora, means it\\'s going to pop up on your reviews), especially those from a younger generation and/or those who resented his policies from the older...and more from those who *left* - even I left for a reason as much as I admire LKY. I think - so imo only - that presenting a more rounded picture would be good for a deeper dive, while focusing on LKY\\'s primacy is good for a brief summary or \"A Westerner\\'s thoughts\" kind of approach. While a good middle ground (again, imo) would be to acknowledge the success of the PR policy of LKY leading above and beyond *while* hinting at and leading to scholarship *about* those other figures. \\n\\n>  One of my biggest takeaways from a policy standpoint was the importance of evaluating policies not in an abstract, idealized context, but with a clear view of the actual cultural forces on the ground.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, there\\'s the benefit of a *lot* of primary sources you can hit - while obviously at the moment Singapore\\'s borders are closed and for good reason, there are any number of biographies - Goh Keng Swee, for instance, published a biography as did Rajaratnam, which can serve as a point of comparison as to underlying cultural attitudes in terms of what accords with LKY and what *doesn\\'t.* \\n\\nOn the other hand, you can also look at what forces drove the coolies out of China, for instance, and what the kind of people that came over look for; while a lot of the policy in the book is high-level politicking with some minor coverage of the results, there was also a culture that came together out of the \"melting pot\" of a lot of races mixing together in close quarters; the predominance of Chinese (which impacted the race riots and the Malaysia situation or were impacted by it). It\\'s more useful to look at mainland Chinese culture around the turn of the 20th century, since that\\'s about when and where the culture of the first Chinese immigrants started from. Look at, perhaps, Roots, by Oliver Chong, an autobiographical play that was specifically about someone tracing back their roots to a small village in China; and what that would imply.\\n\\nI definitely have *thoughts* and *opinions* on this and starting points, and this reply is getting very long - would you like to take it to PMs?'},\n",

I keep it in my backpack; in a secret compartment unreachable from outside (some may argue to never keep your valuables in your bag; but like I've said it's in a super secret compartment not accessible from outside, and I also look after my bag at all times)\\n\\n\\\\- In iBanking, you can lower the threshold that'll trigger a OTP alert and also when you'll receive a notification.

Lucky that account is my \"spending\" account so usually only have ~$200, but at that time i had around $660 and $630 was gone. I reported to OCBC and they did give my money back (after like a month+), except the $100 liability. Maybe next time the card you bring to travel overseas can be linked to a separate account with only $100+ in it. Still can use to buy some stuff when you run out of overseas currency, and when you need to use the card for big purchases can transfer from your other account. More troublesome but at least if you really do lose the card, the loss is minimal.'},\n",

And it has only been recently implemented across banks in Singapore last year in 2017. Whereby Banks here are also now trying to do away with 2FA via SMS when trying to log in to your internet Banking. I can see why Banks are rolling out these changes quietly without much elaboration because that's when customers and cardholders all go nuts knowing that the SMS OTP has always been their last and best line of defence when it comes to safeguarding their money.\\n\\nthe best part is seeing comments scolding the bank for making unnecessary changes like these and don't fix what is not broken and doing this is not user friendly and makes life difficult for them and they want it to be revert back to SMS else they will take their money out and put it with another Bank.\\n\\nall I can say is, I'm not sure if this move from SMS to device based 2FA prompt and OTP is something mandated by the MAS, if it's not, and any of the Banks that I'm currently banking with were to tell me don't worry they will not be making this move, I'm definitely taking my money out from them instead. \\n\\nAnd other than banking, please also migrate your other online accounts from SMS 2FA to device based 2FA instead (if that site supports it). You can start it off right here with your Reddit account. there are many device based OTP generator app out there and the best part is that you just need to choose 1 and it should allow you to add your various different online accounts like Google, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, AWS, PayPal, Discord, LastPass, Dropbox, Snapchat and more. \\n\\nI'm personally using the Microsoft Authenticator because I'm using a Samsung S9+ and the Microsoft Authenticator is the only one that supports unlocking of the authenticator app via Iris.. on top of the usual PIN/Fingerprint offered by others.\"},\n",

Another S$4 billion will be spent on bus contracting subsidies over the same period.\\n\\n> \"While these investments are a necessary part of the Government’s push to improve the public transport experience, they raise operating costs and impose a heavy cost burden on taxpayers,\" he said.\\n\\n> OFF-PEAK TRAVEL REVIEW\\n\\n> The PTC will also review the findings of the Free Pre-Peak Travel and the Off-Peak Pass trials.\\n\\n> The council will assess if the tiered fares to incentivise off-peak travel should become a permanent feature, Mr Magnus said.\\n\\n> \"The concentration of travel within a few hours each day is resource-intensive and inefficient. A more sustainable solution is to spread out travel demand across the day.\" he said.\\n\\n> \"The council is therefore evaluating travel patterns to determine how a differential fare mechanism can best help smoothen travel demand in Singapore.\"\\n\\n> Mr Magnus highlighted that Singapore’s rail fares are among the lowest in Asia, and considerably lower than those in Australian, European and North American cities. The council has also got feedback from commuters that fares are affordable through focus group discussions, he said.\\n\\n> \"We must, and will, continue to keep the voices of our commuters firmly at the forefront, even as we consider the rising costs. We will announce our fare decision in due course,\" he said.\\n\\n> [Source](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fare-review-adds-to-rising-costs-of-public-transport-magnus-9325772)\\n\\n---\\nv1.1 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md)'},\n",

Whoever presses the button first would get the car. Uber would not have cars available in that area, and no one can get a car.

However, I don't agree with that as uber markets itself and acts like a public transport taxi service but at the same time uses such predatory business tactics. If they want to market themselves as a taxi alternative, then play by the same rules with regulation of drivers, cars, availability and fares. If they want to be private car hire then market themselves as that. That's a reason for regulations to safeguard interest of the public with regards to public transport. Looking back to the days of unlicensed taxis in the past, I would say that a dose of regulation is good for this industry. If free market was in play for public transportation, then your bus and mrt fares will be 10 dollars cause who's going to compete with them? You might understand their business model and identify them as not a public transport, but is it the fault of the commuters not understanding that, as uber has marketed itself as a taxi alternative and not a private hire alternative. \"},\n",

If essential goods with not much substitutability are based on demand and supply alone, things that are essential such as transportation will be priced out of reach of people of certain income.

       "    'comment': 'For anyone who is going for any Kpop events organized by IME in the future.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOn 5/8/2017, my sister queued up at Alexandra Post Office from 8am to purchase 4 VIP tickets for Seventeen Diamond Edge in Singapore. Ticket sales started at 12pm, and the counter service at APO managed to secure the 4 VIP tickets, and charged us exactly $1248.00. \\n\\nHowever, for some unbelievable reason, he didn\\'t manage to get them to print!!!! Why??? Nobody has a clue. So they had already taken our 1k+, but we didn\\'t get our tickets.\\n\\nUnderstandably infuriated, I called Apactix and Singpost to question: why couldn\\'t the counter service officer do a SIMPLE and frankly elementary level skill of printing 4 tickets? I was then advised to send them an email including the receipt and our Apactix account number and they would get back to me.\\n\\nA week later, Apactix\\'s customer service officer Cien contacted my sister, and told me this, in their words:\\n\\n\"We will refund you the tickets in full, and give you 4 Cat 1 tickets, as all the VIP tickets are out of stock.\"\\n\\nI double-checked with her, in my words: \"You will refund all $1248, and give me the Cat 1 tickets? So essentially I don\\'t have to pay anything?\"\\n\\nShe replied, \"yes. Can I have your address so that I can mail you the tickets?\"\\n\\nI gave her my address and forgave them for their mistake. After all, it was an honest mistake.\\n\\nFast forward 2 weeks later: no tickets have appeared. I\\'m confused; you told me that you would mail them, and then I don\\'t see any tickets in my mailbox? So I Facebook-messaged Apactix, at which they replied that they would get in contact with my sister.\\n\\nTurns out that the tickets got lost in mail! Apactix did not give me the option to choose what sort of mailing (keep in mind, these tickets are worth in total $992, they LITERALLY sent almost $1k worth of goods in NORMAL MAIL). So they told my sister that she could go down to collect the tickets at Sportshub, which we were fine about.\\n\\nShe went down to collect the tickets on 5/9/2017 at Sportshub, got terribly lost for an hour, but yay she finally got our tickets! And so we thought the saga was over.\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t.\\n\\nToday, 6/9/2017, my sister received a call from Apactix. She was very confused, and passed the phone to me.\\n\\nThey told me, to my ears, without any joking spirit at all:\\n\\n\"The Cat 1 tickets you have are of paid value, and you will have to pay us the $992+ (incl booking fee).\"\\n\\nWhen I heard that, I almost started laughing.\\n\\nSo firstly: your customer service officer told me, with her own words written above, that the tickets would not be charged to me. Secondly, you had TWO WEEKS to get back to me about this, for not only 1 mistake, BUT MULTIPLE MISTAKES.\\n\\nAnd now I\\'m expected to pay? \\n\\nI asked to speak to the manager, Clarence. Who then proceeded to tell me, with his own words:\\n\\n\"This was an honest mistake from my staff, and I apologise, but you will have to pay in full. If not you have the choice to cancel the tickets.\"\\n\\nI replied him: \"Clarence, frankly, is your sorry worth $1000?\"\\n\\nHe could not reply me.\\n\\nSo let me repeat this story:\\n1. You don\\'t educate the staff who are selling your tickets on how to utilize the system, leading to me losing out on the tickets that I wanted.\\n2. Your customer service officer tells me, which I confirmed twice with her, that I will be refunded in full, followed by being given 4 Cat 1 tickets without any extra charge.\\n3. You send my tickets worth well over $900 in normal mail, without giving me the option to choose what sort of mail I want, despite the tickets being worth almost the amount of a diamond, thus losing my tickets.\\n4. You wait 2 weeks to tell me that I am expected to pay IN FULL for tickets that I was given as a concession for not being able to get my VIP tickets.\\n5. You don\\'t even offer me anything, except a few simple words of \"sorry, my staff made a mistake\". And you tell me I can just simply cancel my tickets, even though I\\'ve waited MONTHS for this concert. Appalling, really.\\n\\nAs I reiterated to your customer service manager, your line is NOTHING. When people in hospitals make mistakes, it costs lives. They pay hefty amounts of money to the people who\\'ve lost family members. And you? You can\\'t even give me a good reason. \\n\\nRest assured, I will be filing a report with CASE. I sincerely hope no one else has to deal with this business again.\\n\\n---\\n(Posted on APACTIX Facebook) \\n\\nMy real life account of what happened with APACTIX, and IME, who til today have not responded to any of my queries. Do NOT support these people!!!!! They care absolutely nothing about customer satisfaction; it\\'s almost comical to see how terrible they are at their jobs. '},\n",

       "    'comment': \"> I'm sure there are equally fulfilling vocations in various different forces but for SPF I do agree that being an NPCO is a life changing experience. \\n\\n\\nFirst off, getting into SPF itself is already pretty cool. Like SCDF, once you finish training in SPF, you're put on the ground and you work alongside the regulars who are the same 'vocation' as you doing the same thing. So there's a lot more equal treatment and people really feel like part of the team.\\n\\nbut as for my take: I'm presenting the general view. (also NPCOs get promoted to SC/SGT regardless of qualification) but just comparing the other big ones in SPF like SOC or PCG. \\n\\nSOC: training, more training and mostly staying in base. don't really 'do' much or learn much (at least not about 'police procedure' as opposed to 'tactical procedure'). When deployed, basically just for presence.\\n\\nPCG: daily patrols unlike the above. but there's hardly any activity. mostly like a glorified sentry on the sea watching out for illegal immigrants. most of the time just sitting in a boat looking at the sea.\\n\\nTranscom: i hear the training isn't very good and this is apparent to most people as well. i don't think many people would actually favour this over npco.\\n\\nOCT: staff positions mostly. it's useful in a certain way, but for an NS experience to look back on, staff positions can be pretty lame. Of course the difference is you can tell others you were an Inspector. OCTs that get posted to line positions, now that's more interesting (e.g. the PCG ANO posting isn't too bad).\\n\\nlike honestly, NPCO experience (and the other ones like APD, and even Transcom etc) is the one that best carries over to future life. Good experiences to share and you learn about dealing with people. Yes, dealing with ordinary people not just dealing with uniformed people. problem is NPCO isn't that easy to get anyway.\"},\n",

Movies, music and theatre are major plus points in a city for me and eventually I'd like to live somewhere that has a better arts scene.\\n* After a while, I am going to get restless and feel confined. Every time a friend leaves, they say the same thing - they love it here but they need something new. It's funny, the Singaporean culture of constant change eventually breeds a desire to change your surroundings.\\n* Personal reason here, but my other half lives in the USA and I will have to make a move out there before long. And frankly, that excites me - going from a country smaller than greater London to a country where they have a state bigger than France is just mindblowing.\\n* Beer. Unless something changes massively in five years. \\n* The heat. Oh dear god, the heat. \\n\\nIt'll be a mixed day when I do leave, though.
