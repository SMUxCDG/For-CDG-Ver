That was when I was still studying, and the money was good for uni days. Plus you get a car. \n\nNowadays... It's really shit. You'd be happy if you can touch 3k nett at a 7 day work week, 12h a day. You'd be better off working part time outside. The liabilities are super high even with a rented car.\n\nIf you want to do it part time, try Smove, rent by the hour and drive. With the current situation, you'd be looking at MAX 15-20/hr NETT at peak periods.\n\nMy opinion is subjective though. There are some drivers out there saying still can earn - but then these are experienced drivers who make it a point to study the market, situations and events everyday - which I feel you can put to better use if you work a real FT job. At least you learn skills and can brighten up your resume along the way."

Was a grab driver who got screwed over when Grab took over Uber and monopolised the market.\n\nThings you want to find out:\n\n-Calculate if it is much more worth it to forfeit the contract now, then if you were to slug it out for 3 months\n\n-Look for temporary or part-time jobs, even F&B to tide it out if you chose to slug. This what I did when Grab economy was down to pay off the rental until I couldn't. Nothing is too low for you right now if you're looking to survive.\n\n-Look at freelance delivery services for F&B businesses. This is tough to come by, but you can start looking for neighbourhood telegram groups and advertising your service in them (if group rules allow).\n\nI apologise I do not have much options for you because your situation is different from mine due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI wish you all the best and I do hope that others have suggestions for you too!"

Plus you can even find those cars that are near where you live for convenience purposes."
