(hong kong banned diesel taxis early in the game.) they fitted it with the same diesel engine as the hiace van and dyna lorries. unrefined and relatively weak, yes, but abuse-resistant and easy to repair. the sonata that followed was a quantum leap ahead in refinement (due to commonrail fuel injection), but nowhere near as reliable, partly because drivers tended to idle it for long periods the same way they did the crown, which was really bad for the newer injection and diesel emissions systems."

(at 12, my mom paid me to type invoices for her in her office during my school holidays)so i had savings. but yea, as a teenager, you really don't think alot of things through.also lots of reckless adventures in australia lol. alot of things were sheer luck, nothing serious really happened."

(e.g. this [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/05/20/are-electric-vehicles-really-better-for-the-environment/?sh=323e988376d2)).but definitely support if these electrical cars are used for the next couple of decades at least, along with better greener electrical infrastructures."

[eri@n (ntu) and nccs says no.](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/e-mobility-technology-roadmap.pdf)before you say \"but muh fleet ev management!!\", that may help centralised vehicular and logistics companies (like say, sbs/smrt buses or singpost/ninjavan trucks), the very nature of taxis and [smrt's taxi share business model](https://www.taxishare.com.sg/) makes it even harder to achieve.don't get me wrong, i love green tech, but...fact of the matter is sg is not ready, not now, not in 5 years, to support an ev network.that's why the govt made it green plan 2040 on a policy level, not 2026. anyone thinking this is anything more than greenwashing/green pr by smrt is simply lying to themselves.edit : forgot to add, you mention that tesla is a small company, but i'm talking about the charging infrastructure. they're one of the larger ev companies that are also building fast charging dc networks, and iirc they have about 20+% market share in usa, which is definitely a top 3 country by ev volume. so yeah, maybe their company's guidance on the charging network counts for something?"

300,000 masks that they can offer to passengers who are unwell, said the land transport authority (lta), as the country ramps up its defence against the global coronavirus outbreak.> from tuesday (feb 11), 300,000 surgical masks will be distributed to the drivers via their taxi and ride-hailing companies in packs of four, said lta in a press release.> advertisement> advertisement> these masks are intended for drivers to offer to passengers who are unwell, but do not have a mask and need a ride to seek medical attention.> \"passengers should also play their part. in particular, passengers who are unwell are reminded to be socially responsible and don a mask, before their taxi or private-hire car ride,\" said lta.> advertisement> advertisement> as part of precautionary measures, drivers have also been asked to take their temperature twice a day.> from tuesday, eight temperature screening stations will be set up at the premises of the seven taxi companies here.> taxi drivers whose temperatures fall within the acceptable range will receive a sticker for the day, to indicate that they are well.> private-hire drivers will be required to take their own temperatures and submit their readings via the app.> the lta, together with the national taxi association (nta) and the national private hire vehicle association (nphva), will progressively increase the number of temperature screening stations in singapore for all drivers, said lta.> these measures come after a taxi driver and a private-hire car driver were among seven new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus announced on saturday.> neither had any known links to other cases.> the lta said then that it was working with operators to ramp up cleaning and hygiene measures.> it also advised drivers to wind down their windows after trips to ventilate their vehicles, as well as clean and disinfect their cars more regularly.> earlier this month, a care package was announced for both taxi and private-hire drivers who are quarantined due to the virus.> these drivers are eligible for a s$100 per day allowance from the government during the time they are quarantined.> all taxi operators, as well as private-hire firms gojek, grab and ryde, have said they will waive vehicle rental fees for quarantined drivers.> all taxi operators, as well as gojek, grab, ryde and tada, have also committed to a one-off allowance of at least s$100 for quarantined drivers.> meanwhile, drivers who are members of either the nta or the nphva are also eligible for a one-off allowance of s$200.> measures aimed at restoring confidence in taxis, private-hire cars> on monday, senior minister of state for transport janil puthucheary met with about 40 taxi and private-hire drivers at the devan nair institute for employment and employability, to discuss their concerns following the news of the two infected drivers.> speaking to the media after the session, dr janil said drivers he spoke to were concerned about how to sustain their livelihoods in light of the current crisis.> the measures announced today are aimed at restoring confidence in the industry, he noted.> \u201cpassengers need to find a way to be confident in the vehicle and driver that\u2019s picking them up,\u201d he said.> noting reports of commuters finding it hard to get rides at locations such as hospitals, dr janil said it was understandable that drivers might feel anxious about picking up passengers who are unwell.> however, drivers should have no qualms ferrying passengers who are sick but wearing masks, he said.> \u201cif there are nurses and healthcare workers that need to get home after a late night shift, i\u2019ve asked (the drivers) to help us get these frontline workers home and have some rest,\u201d he said.> dr janil also debunked reports that suggested the novel coronavirus was airborne, noting the chinese government itself had said the virus was not airborne.> \u201call the evidence currently points to this virus being spread by droplets, not airborne, and that is what is determining the way we address it.\u201d> he acknowledged that the measures announced could be abused, for example by drivers who claim the masks for themselves instead of giving them out to sick passengers.> \u201ci think we have to accept in good faith that (drivers) will look after themselves and the people around them.\u201d> while there are other broad-based financial measures in the works to protect the livelihoods of drivers, dr janil said it was premature to announce anything at this stage.> drivers concerned about getting infected> mr harry ng, 61, said his daily earnings had dropped about 20 per cent in the two weeks since the first coronavirus cases were announced here.> however, the impact was much worse during the sars crisis in 2003, when passengers were few and far between, said the cabbie of 25 years.> drivers are concerned about getting infected, as well as passing the infection down to their families, said nta president raymond ong.> \u201cthe fear is there,\u201d said the 60-year-old, who has been a taxi driver for 20 years.> drivers are also hopeful that the government can work together with taxi operators and the nta to ease their financial burden during this period, for example by lowering the cost of renting their vehicles, said mr ong.> the drop in passenger numbers means some drivers struggle to cover costs such as rental and fuel, he noted.> in a statement, mr ang hin kee - who is advisor to both the nta and the nphva - said the two associations were continuing to explore ways to assist drivers who are infected and quarantined with their expenses.> \u201cwe are also doing more to ensure that drivers at large are taken care of during this period so that they can continue to deliver safe and quality services to commuters,\u201d he said.> download our app or subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak:

                "comment": "to say that the taxi industry has been disrupted by ride-hailing  firms would be an understatement. decimated may be a better word.in just five years, the industry has witnessed its combined fleet  reduced by 10,000 vehicles - or more than one-third. at just over  18,000, the cab population is now at its smallest in 10 years.and there is no sign of the shrinkage halting, or even slowing down.  at this rate, it is foreseeable that singapore will have fewer than  10,000 taxis by 2025, and 5,000 by 2030.if this ever comes to pass, it would be devastating not only to taxi  operators. commuters will be the poorer for it, because the only thing  that is keeping a check on fares - and service standards - now is the  intense competition between taxi companies and ride-hailing firms.taxi operators have responded to the disruption by setting up  private-hire fleets of their own. these include smrt, prime, trans-cab  and market leader comfortdelgro.while this \"can't fight them, join them\" stance may shore up revenue  in the short term, it may well have a negative impact on their core  business eventually.yet, if these companies do not cannibalise their own business, others  will. it is a conundrum faced by many, including those in the media,  hospitality and travel sectors.by  setting up private-hire units, taxi companies open up a new revenue  stream from hirers who, for one reason or other, do not wish to drive a  cab for a living.it also allows them bigger growth potential, as private-hire  companies can expand their fleets as they see fit. taxi fleet expansion,  however, is controlled.there are several other factors that make operating a private-hire  fleet less costly and less cumbersome than operating a taxi business,  including access to a bigger pool of drivers (no minimum age, unlike for  cabbies), and being able to keep their vehicles longer (no maximum age,  unlike for taxis).as long as the authorities continue to see no need to harmonise  policies and regulations for cabs and private-hire cars, starting up a  private-hire division is a viable way for taxi companies to shore up  flagging revenue. but surely, having a private-hire arm cannot be the only thing taxi  companies can do to win back their lunch. because if that is their only  plan, then the days of taxis are numbered.if that happens, these erstwhile cab companies might find themselves  on shaky ground. even now, they are competing against two big players  that seem to have an inexhaustible supply of investors' funds.it does not matter that grab and gojek remain unprofitable after more  than seven years of operation. investors are still pouring money into  them. as of last year, grab had raised about us$8 billion (s$10.8  billion), while gojek had raised at least us$3.3 billion.none of the taxi players has the luxury of this new business model,  where companies burn through billions without making money, and  seemingly without having to answer to shareholders.it is this unconventional model that has allowed the disruptors to  charge commuters lower fares and drivers lower rentals than what taxi  firms charge. this, of course, cannot go on indefinitely, because  investors will eventually want to see some returns.so taxi operators who swing the pendulum too far towards private-hire  may find themselves in a precarious position when the market reverts to  a more steady state.what that steady state may be is the $64,000 question.but considering that the point-to-point transportation market was  served by 28,000 taxis before private-hire firms started taking root  here, but is now served by around 70,000 vehicles, there is a clear  indication of an oversupply.this number is simply not sustainable without subsidies (from  investors who keep vehicle rentals and fares low). when subsidies dry up  - and they will one day - the market will arrive at a more realistic  number.grab and gojek, of course, have a larger game plan. they have  ventured into several non-transport businesses (either here or abroad),  such as e-payments, food delivery, finance and insurance. each has the  ambition to become a super app.so, even if the private-hire sector undergoes a consolidation, both companies will carry on.#### options for taxi companieswhat about the taxi companies? if they bank too much on the  private-hire business, it may tip their core business to the point of no  return.hence they should expend more energy on preserving the taxi business.  on the whole, this business is still viable, and for several reasons.taxis can do street hails, taxis generally command a higher rental  rate than private-hire cars, taxis are still sought after by commuters  who prefer larger vehicles that are more comfy and can accommodate more  luggage (tourists, for instance).and taxis in most first world cities enjoy a level of trust. they are  also preferred by commuters who do not particularly like surge pricing.what can the taxi industry do to turn the tide, and to reclaim their diminished pie?well, one way would be to join forces. this may not necessarily take  the form of mergers or acquisitions, but rather, an alliance.many years ago, there was an attempt to devise a centralised  call-booking platform that would have allowed commuters to dial one  number to access the nearest available cab among all operators.vendors had found it to be technically feasible. but some taxi  companies, ostensibly out of self-interest, were not in favour of it. in  the end, a poor substitute was offered - commuters dialled one number,  and would be diverted to a cab operator, which would then dispatch a  taxi.obviously, that convoluted proposition did not take off, since it was  easier for commuters to reach the taxi company that could fulfil their  booking most speedily (usually comfortdelgro since it has the largest  fleet).that exercise was done before private-hire firms arrived.  circumstances have changed dramatically since. hence it may be opportune  to revisit it. now, it can even be extended to include a common app  that will dispatch the nearest available cab.with a combined fleet of 18,000 taxis, the industry is in a better  position to compete with the private-hire players than individually.  even comfortdelgro, the largest player with close to around 11,000 cabs,  benefits from an alliance in these dire times.the cab companies may need a nudge to come together. even the first exercise was initiated by the land transport authority.in the bigger scheme of things, it would be in the interest of  singapore to have a point-to-point transportation market that is  sustainable, and which is in line with the country's aim to become  \"car-lite\".a new regulatory framework that is slated to be effective from june  does not seem to address the glaring inequity that has allowed the  private-hire population to grow 70-fold since 2013.consequences of an uneven playing field go far beyond operating cost differences between taxi and private-hire players.besides clearly running contrary to the whole car-lite push, the  situation has implications on public safety. when there is no limit on  fleet size, an oversupply is likely to occur. when there is an  oversupply, commuters are naturally happy. but drivers end up having to  drive longer to make a living. fatigue and higher accident rates can set  in.having no minimum age for private-hire drivers, and no maximum age for their cars, will fuel the same outcome.contrary to popular belief, the market does not always adjust. and  even if it does, it rarely does so in a timely fashion. which is why  singapore has to take active steps to manage the taxi population,  including ensuring it continues to remain viable."
