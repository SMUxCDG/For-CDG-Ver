With that little time you have, I'd simply suggest just going sight-seeing and trying out our local food. If you planned on doing anything else apart from going typical tourist mode, then I heavily advise you to do it when you're on holiday here!\n\nWhat you had in mind is basically what I'm supporting. But as another Redditor mentioned, your best place to try out local food that's near the airport is Changi Village. It's definitely Singaporean enough, you must have it on your itinerary.\n\nIf you could specify your interest (in terms of sights to see), then it'd be easier for us to suggest places to visit."

A short term rental could be in months for a young guy (like yours truly), and in years for an uncle. I personally prefer rental over ownership in Singapore because I'm driving grab on the car anyway and maintenance fees would rake up given the amount of mileage I accumulate in a month."

Most of the places I go to in the city and near my area are bus/train accessible so I never really had a reason to get a car. The trainsand buses aren't really good on punctuality sometimes and some of them are quite infrequent (can be half an hour to an hour between trains at night).

Some practices might be quite different but its things that are not really difficult to adapt. You really get to see a lot of different things and meet people from really different cultures.\n\nThe biggest adjustments you have to make is probably to pay attention to your safety much more.

The social possibilities expand infinitely and you will meet folks from all walks of life, not to mention time saved on commutes and cooking, cleaning, etc. It is more expensive but I worked throughout my degree programme so I could afford it. \n\n- Depending on where you are located, you probably won't need a car so there's a big saving there. The trains are functional and taxis are common; although expensive. The vast, vast majority of overseas students I knew didn't have a car either.\n\n-  Cultural adjustment: a lot of overseas students mix almost exclusively with their compatriots, and that's easy in many of the big Unis which are incredibly cosmopolitan.  IMHO, that kind of misses the point of studying overseas. Learning how other cultures work and think is invaluable, and an overseas stint is a great opportunity to do it.\n\n- Immerse yourself in the local culture, get a part-time job (not necessarily for the money but learning how the country works and what the people are like), form your connections. Living on campus helps that integration tremendously as well.\n\n- What do I miss? Cheap beer, nice beaches, mild seasons, some very good food and coffee, occasional racism, wide open spaces and straight talking.\n\nHave fun!"

(since the public transport system isn't as efficient as SG's)\n\nCars in oz can be as cheap as $600, but a normal 15 year old <200k would be 3-6k. At first I lived on campus, so no, then after that, rented close by, but i was seeing a local girl (now wife), so I had to buy a car.\n\n> Did you choose to live on campus or rent an apartment off campus within the city? What were the reasons behind that and how much approximately, per week did you finance residence?\n\nCampus at first to make friends. Meals provided, but all up very expensive. Moved after a year.\n\n> How was it like for you adjusting to a new culture?\n\nMy #1 protip is don't say fuck the sinkies and make AMDK friends. Those people get ostracised very quickly (guys), or get passed around (girls). Make sinkie friends, be established, then go know other people. 95% of sinkies will either mix only with each other, or go full SPG and get passed around.\n\nIf you have a church or club outside uni, that's the place you go to make friends with the locals.\n\nI've been here close to 20 years, and I can say that the rate of bad AMDK is exactly the same as bad sinkies. You do not want to be friends with the majority of them.\n\nIf you decide to migrate, your main friend group will be ABCs. In fact, they're the best way to know the local culture, as they're the perfect mix of east and west. Even in your uni days, the more ABCs you know, the better.\n\n> Why did you choose to pursue your degree in Australia as opposed to say, back home in Singapore or other countries? (eg US, UK)\n\nToo stupid, buang a levels.\n\n> (if you're comfortable sharing) Did you go on a scholarship (partial, full etc)? If not, did your parents finance the entire sum or did you also work part time / save up a few years beforehand to supplement the funds / to ease their financial burden?\n\nMother looted her savings, but its a good move, as I earn x2 of what I would have earned in sg (yes, factoring tax too), and I brought her over when we bought a house, to stay FOC everything. This one really depends, because some people I know char siew their parents and forget about them after they move over.\n\nA lot of ppl I know, especially malaysians, will work part time and study, but a lot of them keep failing units, because work too much. In the end waste more money than they earn. If your coursework is tough, work during the school breaks, and focus on studying during the semester.\n\nMy last tip is study what can get you a job, and if possible, ability to migrate. Investigate and research thoroughly on your own."

And if you like wine, boxed wine is your friend.\n\n\u2022 I had the luxury of staying both on and off campus. Definitely easier to manage on campus as they have included meals and other things to help you mingle. But if you are adventurous to be independent definitely try finding an apartment on your own. Either way it\u2019s a fun experience.\n\n\u2022 Australia is a \u2018safe\u2019 space to expand your academic horizons considering you\u2019ll not feel so alien due to the sheer amount of asians there. We are still the minority but you would be forgiven to feel otherwise on campus. We would be on the receiving end of some xenophobia but you\u2019ll learn to handle yourself.\n\n\u2022 as mentioned by many, causal jobs are not easy to come by. So hone your networking skills if you really want to have the full varsity experience i.e. working part time and occasional partying and driving your half of oz during summer/winter break.\n\n\u2022 talking about summer breaks, do plan if you intend to have your career back home as those are the best time to score contract work in Singapore. I\u2019ve benefited from having contract work every summer break which are usually much higher in both monetary value and work experience than so called paid internships.\n\n\u2022 last but not least, do at least try to spend 3 months living extravagantly (preferably 6) as you are not going to have this time again (not having work stress, having/making friends everywhere). Counter-intuitively this helped me a lot in understanding the value of money in my life back home and more stories to talk about."

I mean Singaporean food is amazing and I missed it everyday while overseas, but there are some things you cannot get here.\n\n\\- standard brunch food and coffee. Quality here is just not the same.\n\n\\- dessert slices (Caramel slice, vanilla slice)\n\n\\- amazing Vietnamese food that's hella authentic\n\n\\- every average Thai place in Australia beats out any average Thai place in Singapore\n\n\\- If you've ever wanted to try fine dining, it's cheaper and higher quality in Australia (not kidding)\n\n\\- \"expensive\" Japanese food is far cheaper and much better in Australia as well. You'd be paying 3x the price in Singapore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* (if you're comfortable sharing) Did you go on a scholarship (partial, full etc)? If not, did your parents finance the entire sum or did you also work part time / save up a few years beforehand to supplement the funds / to ease their financial burden?\n\nParents paid, but had a grant from the government to come back that paid a bit of it. Had the privilege of not needing to do part-time work as my degree had far more contact hours and the trade-off for academic effort wasn't worth it. I did volunteer on and off though."

                "comment": "I'm studying in the ANU in Canberra. You've probably never heard of it but it's a Go8 university. \n\nBut I came home due to virus. It's uncertain when the travel ban will be lifted, so you might end up taking a gap year. It's not worth it to pay so much to take classes online. \n\n1. Nope. Can't drive. I don't think it's necessary. I lived on campus and there's not much outside the city centre. \n2. on campus. It's 300 a week. Non catered. It is expensive. \n3. I don't perceive a cultural difference. If you are gay/trans etc you would feel more free expressing your sexuality/gender there, but I'm not any of these things. \n4. Didn't get admitted to local u. But I've had classes in NTU and NUS before. I can say I prefer my classes at ANU. I've sat in on classes in Durham and Bristol. I think ANU is better. This varies with which university and which major.   \nI had some plans to transfer to a UK university, and I was accepted by all my choices. I rejected them in the end due to the way COVID was managed and Brexit. Brexit is going to be a disaster. \n5. I planned to work to save money, but my parents decided to pay in the end. The truth is, if I had really worked to get money, I could expect to start studying perhaps 10, 20 years later. It's incredibly costly. I advise you to be smart, and if the subject isn't for you, look for alternatives quickly, explore the university. I have a friend at ANU, also from Singapore, doing IR. He hated it and was so depressed but couldn't bring himself to change majors or universities (due to depression??) and it was painful for me to see him like that but I couldn't do anything but talk to him. \n\nhave you visited this place yet? If you haven't, please visit before paying tuition and rent. It might not be what you imagine. I was very surprised when I got to Canberra. Not due to culture shock but because there was very little to do, the scenery was all like brown and dry. And the public transport was sparse.   \n\n\nLooking over your post you did say this is your dream uni and that you've thought about it for years. I'm so happy for you. Just do lots of research. I met a chinese girl at my university who said she had considered all her options for years, then researched ANU for 6 months. Even though she had never been to Australia, nothing about Canberra surprised her and she liked it very much. If you've done as much research I think you are going to make a good choice."

                "comment": "Congratulations on passing. I will give you a few reasons why you should not rent a car just yet. \n\n1. You only have 13 points to spare for 1 year. It's pretty easy to get demerit points nowadays. Parking will likely catch you out, since you are a new driver. That's worth a few points on its own. Not to mention the red light camera. They change from amber to red very quickly. You might not have the reaction time to deal with it. \n\n2. Cars are extremely expensive to fix. Small dent, small scrape, it will cost you an arm and a leg back at the rental firm. When you rent a car, you have to be aware of all the damages on the car. It has to be photographed and written down. Unless someone experienced goes with you to collect the car, chances are that you will miss things that will be used against you when you return the car. The salesman will gloss over the damage when you collect it, but make a big deal when you return the car. That's how it works, and you have to be aware of it. \n\n3. most firms don't rent to P-plates. If they do, they require a higher deposit and higher insurance excess. It's not uncommon to hear of excess of 10k for a P-plate rental car. \n\n4. If you do wanna rent, go for the bigger more established firms. They will be more upfront and honest in their dealings. Their prices will definitely be higher. But you can be sure that they won't try to makan you on hidden damages. Their cars tend to be newer / more well maintained. \n\n5. Driving on your own with a P-plate is unlike driving a car with a L-plate. Most motorists don't give a shit if you are P-plate. They will cut your lane anyhowly or jam brake as they like. It's a very scary world out there. \n\nFeel free to post any questions and I'm sure others will be willing to advice you. "

Most rental companies have an excess of $4k and above, and they are usually in cahoots with their own workshops to inflate the repair costs such that you are forced to pay the full excess. My friend accidentally reversed his rental car into a pole and there was a slight dent, when he returned it to the rental company they sent it to the workshop and the workshop said it affected the structural integrity of the car\u2019s rear and he had to pay $3800 excess money. The dent was about 1cm in and 5mm wide. Do know what you\u2019re getting into when you rent a car, the moment you get into an accident no matter how small, be prepared to fork out thousands. "

They are pretty famous on the net.\n\nSo far I have good experience with CL Leasing and SGRentACar at WCEGA Plaza (Bt Batok area). Deposit around 200 to 300 SGD, refundable as long as you don't damage the car. ERP, parking charges, fuel, summons all borne by user. Park at your own area, no need to park at rental firm. Return fuel at level which they gave you the car at. Even if it means 1/4 tank, return 1/4 tank, don't lose.\n\nDriving is expensive business. I rented from CL when I still had P Plate, drove a Toyota Estima for two weeks. Glad to have started from a reputable, safe company. I got friends who got \"scammed\" thousands of dollars because of shaddy rental firms. As much as I had a relatively good car rental experience over two years, I wish that you have a good one too. All the best.\n\nPS: Upon two years of your license, switch to car sharing like smove or Tribecar, easier to obtain a car and generally cheaper, goes by hour etc. I rarely go to rental firms today unless driving up to Malaysia."

I'd actually like to shed some light on the phrases 'first world' and 'third world' as they have quite remarkable yet obscure histories behind them (Geography lesson coming up haha). \n\nThe idea of 'development', as understood from the Western frame of context of 'progress in society', is largely a myth that has been exported around the world and is based in histories of colonialism and tied also to capitalism. Back when colonialism had just started, a lot of the colonisers took over indigenous peoples' lands with the idea that they were 'civilised' and knew how to do science and technology, while indigenous peoples were 'backward / primitive / uncivilised / barbaric'. \n\nThis actually still has legacies till today, when it's 'developed countries' or 'first world countries' exporting foreign aid, systems of democracy / capitalism, notions of justice and even how to do conservation, to 'developing' or 'third world countries' based on the assumption that the latter are incapable of governing their own countries - which is a whole other can of worms because for instance most of the sub-Saharan African countries have boundaries that were drawn by white people sitting at a table in Berlin."

My dad's been letting me know for quite awhile how there's no one on the streets even after 4 hours of waiting, and how many grab drivers have been calling into the grab office to no avail. I honestly have no idea what the company is doing, but as of yesterday my dad told me that his rental has been cut by half, from $75 a day.  And he's also applied for GrabFood. He's also has been down to the CC to apply for the temporary relief fund which gave out I think $300? If I'm not wrong. Not much but whatever works in this climate! \n\nSimilar to you I've also been working throughout uni as a freelancer, but because of the virus situation many of my clients have stopped content production so my source of income has dried up. I think its great that you've stepped up to help your family by giving tuition, I can only wish I had this level of aptitude. If you haven't already do apply for uni FA, might not come in anytime soon but at least you'll know if you're eligible for anything. I don't have any solutions to offer sadly, but I empathise greatly and am wishing your family the best of health. Despite the shitty circumstances we operate in my dad always says to me, stay positive :-)"

Your situation sucks. \n\nTake it as a lesson when you go out into workforce, that the gig economy is not as beneficial for society as they claimed, and worker class is always marginalized. \n\nGrab serves as a matchmaking platform between supply and demand. In current situation, current demand simply don\u2019t exist at current supply. And they have no incentive to keep the excess supply, as they know once the time comes around, there will always be people who become grab drivers due to various reasons, and they have many levers to entice people joining. Since they are directly dependent on demand to generate bulk of their revenue, during normal times, they need optimize supply to meet the demand in order to maximize revenue. That\u2019s why they always entice drivers to onboard during good times and does the bare minimum to help them during bad times. \n\nOn the other hand, taxi companies in SG derives revenue from rental, diesel/petrol mark-ups, insurance, etc. They have incentives to make sure supply is always engaged even during bad times. The net cost of parking excess idle taxis and maintenance is higher than if those taxis are rented out at zero rental fees. Taxi companies revenue are less dependent on taxi driver\u2019s income, as compared to Grab. Zero rental from taxi companies while hugely beneficial for taxi drivers, is not an altruistic act. \n\nIf you want to help out your family situation. At present, borrow a bicycle from your friends, and use it to do grabfood/foodpanda/deliveroo. Demand for those will increase with the soft lockdown, as there will be zero dining out and too many young people can\u2019t cook. Last mile delivery would also see an increase in demand, so delivery/last mile enabler workers will also be needed. Instead of going zero income on tuition entirely, you could offer to be homework checker for your tutee at a smaller fee.\n\nWishing you all the best, and hope you will be able to give your parents a better life in future."

Try to budget a set amount for each country and then use a lump sum of USD to use/change. I'd advise using the ATM to withdraw the money instead of carrying it with you.\n\n2) I'm not sure if you've actually done any meaningful research on this tbh. You can't go from Thailand to China directly, and you shouldn't go via Laos because that area is in chaos. Going via Vietnam or eastern Myanmar is your best bet. \n\nToll fees exist for each border (within each state of a country actually). You're going to have to research them yourself, depending on the route you take. You'll have to pay and face some questions when you're crossing other borders (e.g. Cambodia-Vietnam/Thailand-Laos).\n\n3) Again, I'm not sure if you've actually done any meaningful research on this tbh. Yes, technically you just need a passport, no, you can't just up and go right away because you need the visa attached to the passport. Singaporeans need a visa if you're going to be in China for more than 15 days. You'll definitely need more than that amount of time to traverse China. And you definitely need a visa for Russia."

Thailand doesn't border China so you're going to have to cross probably though Laos which doesn't have much infrastructure, but I would guess you can still get to the Chinese border.  Then you'll find that you can't bring your car into China without having gone through extreme bureaucracy beforehand, and even then you can't drive it without a Chinese driving licence."

I have heard a lot of stories of people riding to Europe and bringing the bike back via cargo flight with a car I\u2019m not so sure about this as you would need to drive back which can be fun or eat away at your soul. I would recommend asking around in riding forums! The riding routes don\u2019t usually go via China and Russia. The stories I know of goes from Singapore up through all the Stan-counties and entering Europe via turkey. And require a lot of meticulous planning for the visa requirements of entering and bringing in a vehicle\n\nI have personally backpacked a lot of Eastern European countries. Depending on your route. Eastern Europe has a uses a lot of different currencies, you have a few options\n\n1) stock pile euro/us/sg dollars and change it whenever needed. Take note that there are a lot of scam money changers in Europe where they offer insanely high rates but charge a 30% commission. Also you risk being robbed and losing everything. Your safest best would be hoarding EURO as it can be changed nearly anywhere on your trip from Asia to Russia\n\n2) using the ATM and withdrawing money. This has a risk of getting your details stolen and also having shitty rates. So use only the ATM machines at the bank itself if you find it risky.  You can try  researching YouTrip/ multi currency cards. However they mostly only have value for currencies that are popularly used like euro us ausd.\n\n3) mixture of both. Personally I backpack so I don\u2019t carry large quantities of money when I travel as the lockers aren\u2019t very reliable. You have the safety of hiding it in your automobile so take that into consideration."

They everything has to be orderly.That everyone should always stay in their own lane to a fault, and this competitive defensiveness that pisses us off when someone got ahead of us and moved into the space ahead ahead of us. \n\nHow many times have anyone experienced that when you are trying to cut into the next lane only when you realize the car suddenly speeds up to close the gap to prevent you from coming in? \n\nHaving driven in a number of countries, I find Singaporean drivers the most unforgiving (\u770b\u4e0d\u5f00\uff09and calculative (\u65a4\u65a4\u8ba1\u8f83\uff09drivers.

Like one of the other comments said, someone cuts or wants to cut into your lane, slow down, take a deep breath, it happens! Someone\u2019s turning out and seems like taking a wide turn, slow down, take preemptive steps to change lane or something, and take a deep breath \n\nDon\u2019t impose your personal belief of order on the other party  and expect them to follow it, at your own peril?!

Don\u2019t \u2018tsk\u2019 and then drive by and turn your head to stare at them, keep your eyes on the road!\n\nChill, fellow drivers.

Bumper to Bumper traffic in the motorway, but everyone\u2019s moving, and it\u2019s still easy to change lanes if you need to get to your exit, or enter into the motorway. Because when people see you trying to change lanes, the person will slow down and let you change lanes. When trying to enter the jammed up motorway, they do something called the zipper, where people take turns to enter the motorway. \n\nTry that shit here. Entering a motorway you have idiots who will drive all the way to the front and then try to jam their way inside. Then the people in the queue don\u2019t want to let them cut so won\u2019t give them any space. People already on the expressway will pretend people trying to enter the expressway don\u2019t exist. Try to change lane and you have people who will close up the gap when they see your signal. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just these days, I used to see this nonsense as a kid when I was on the way to school donkey years back. Now as a driver I see it more often. As far as possible I try to be the change I want to see, but then people will horn and high beam me. \n\nJust this morning this guy clearly was in the wrong lane by mistake (not an expressway, just normal road, morning rush hour, that area quite jammed, plus traffic light) he rolled down his window and asked if he could get in front of me, and I was more than happy to let him go, and the people behind me got really unhappy when I stopped to let him through, and I got horned at and flashed at for the entire 5 seconds this entire thing took.

Perhaps I really was drifting between lanes and driving on the line but in Singapore culture, the horn is seen as hostile. \n\nOn the other hand, I almost never horn unless it's to prevent a very horrible accident. At this point I wonder if you sound the horn when you see another cad turning out of another junction into say lane 3 for e.g. When you're moving on lane 2. It could be dangerous if the car turns out too wide and cuts into lane 2 but is your reaction to always horn? I rather just drive slower to ensure he finishes the peak of the turn. \n\nThen again, this is just unique to singapore and I think we should change to see it as a gentle reminder. But horns annoy me still."

For some countries using a horn is pretty normal, here people regard it more as a \"fuck you\" than a \"hey coming through\". Have experienced what you been through too and its worse on two wheels. Cutting off a car on 4 wheels is one thing, doing it to an inexperienced rider could result in tragedy.  Sometimes when they give the horn back I just give the finger hehe, sorta depends on how bad it was and my mood that day if i'm honest. Its disgusting how some people who drive horribly think they did nothing wrong to you, like giving you a blur face. Honestly is it so hard to put your hand out and simply wave a sorry after a fuck up? No one is perfect la, doing that more often than not the rider/driver will most probably cool down. I once almost got cut off by a lady driver who probably did not check her blind spot before her lane change, gave it a lil horn. We pulled up to a red light and she rolled her window down to apologise. I wasn't even looking at her before that but she did it willingly. This lady driver had more balls than a lot of male drivers i've encountered over my 8 year on the road, the kind that avoid eye contact totally even though its totally their fault. It may seem like the roads are getting horrible but there are still decent drivers around. Just do what you think is right and hopefully karma will settle the rest of the fuckers."

Singapore was a migrant country and though we don't have a national identity / culture deep enough to produce \"interesting\" stuff yet (that's why I think we should probably keep Singlish, but again this is debatable), I guess we are slowly improving.\n\nAlso, I think for the past 50 years, Singapore has been focusing on how to survive, we've got so comfortable with what we have now that we always complain that the country doesn't put enough effort in the sports, arts, or even civil-mindedness (remember the resignation of courtesy lion). Sorry, if Singlish is not preferred, but I think must give some chance la, you can only do a few things at a time. Things like arts, culture and sports, will need a long time to develop. "

(to me, it's a disgrace if i need help from the government to feed myself).

Extrovert doesn't just means doing outdoor activities, but more about socialising.\n\nFor me, I think whenever I go back to Singapore, I have troubles turning people down for catch ups. I think people are extrovert enough - but perhaps it's a difference of \"us vs them\". It's easier to be friends with people whom you have grown up with than to make adult friends? \n\nAs for veggies, after moving overseas, I actually agree with the OP. It's easy to say \"just order a meal with veggies\". Unless you order Cai png, and a select number of other local dishes, most of our meals come with sad looking and minimal amounts of veggies. For example, chicken rice. The soup is supposed to be made out of consomm\u00e9 and cabbage, but most soups at the most come with a patch of cabbage. And 3 slices of cucumber. Horfun comes with enough leafy veggies to fit the bottom of a small rice bowl. Even if we order a pure veggie dish, it can be very greasy.\n\nBut some of our best foods are damn greasy lol.

Apparently the second wealthiest city in Asia circa 1965 was a swampy fishing village.\n\nThe first generation PAPs achievement wasn't making the country wealthy- they'd have had to seriously screw up for that not to happen- their achievement was spreading the wealth in the 1960s and 70s and laying the foundation for an upwardly mobile, educated lower middle class. \n\nOf course they haven't had an original idea since LKY purged the party and achieved sole control in the early 80s but that's another story. But the fishing village myth makes it easier to mythologise Lee instead of giving the credit to the large team of talented individuals he threw under the bus. \n"

                "comment": "1) the 3 weeks visa (more or less) is nearly a non-issue. You can always extend, or waltz into Malaysia and back again like normal Singaporeans going to Malaysia on the weekend if you wanna stay a little longer. However, if there's a need (eg parents sick etc etc), there are [longer term visas](https://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/topics/pages/mobile/topicsdetail.aspx?mpageId=197) . \n\n2) to be honest, my most racist experience was actually during my trip in Singapore to renounce my citizenship (lol). But this is a deep question and I will try my best to respond.\n\nRacism is a human construct, that's the most basic thing to remember. For people to see and feel the differences, they are not the smartest, flexible and sociable creatures to be with anyways. So why bother with them? People will always have some sort of bias, even in Singapore, so we can learn to deal with it or don't. I mean, let's face it. Singaporeans now have an anti prc, anti foreigner mentality. That's a form of bias in itself. Just because it's us vs them doesn't mean we aren't racist in Singapore. Way back when I was growing up, it was either Indians are stupid or Malays are thieves, right?\n\nTo get offended is both a choice and a weapon. In Australia, at least, there are laws protecting people from racism, and equal amounts of people protecting others from racism. If you choose to be offended, you will not be alone and people will help you, some times for the most ridiculous reasons and extent. Eg I know a Korean person who was quite abusive to both her clients (who are dependent on her) and colleagues. But when she was reported to authorities, she got let go with \"cultural differences\".\n\nBut also, perhaps it's time for a reflection on yourself. Growing up, I was not comfortable being Chinese. Never cared about my roots, didn't care to learn more. After I came here and meeting so many people from all walks of life, I learnt to appreciate my difference and cultural history more. Australians take themselves very lightly, while still very much in love with being an Australian, and I think I have turned out the same. I can joke about being Chinese, being squinty eyed, but I genuinely appreciate it enough to go back and study mandarin (lmao, it suffered) and read Chinese history. It takes a lot to offend/humiliate me these days, and if there's any racist connotations these days, I either try to educate or walk away depending on the situation.\n\n3) the real question is \"why would you give up your red passport\" right? Then the question is \"what's holding you back?\"\n\nFor me, \n\n- I don't go back to Singapore often enough. These days, I am probably more tourists than tourists are. I didn't even know what a Singapore flyer was till a cabbie pointed it out lol. And I am never returning full time.\n\n- half the places Singapore passports have privileges with, I don't even visit. \n\n- I haven't had the right to vote since a decade before I renounce. Because I haven't stayed in Singapore for the right amount of time. That said, my knowledge of politics in both country is about the same.\n\n- I am never buying a flat in Singapore \n\n- my cpf in Australia has way more money than my cpf in Singapore. \n\n- there's more opportunities here than in Singapore for me.\n\n- my life is here now. I still have friends and family in Singapore, yes, but I am more familiar with Australia than I am in Singapore. It's not just about friends and family, but what I am entitled to and what I can do. (Legalities, work, etc)\n\n- I have even more opportunities if I turn into a citizen in Australia.\n\nBut people differ. Some people genuinely think they will return after a while (I know friends who go back to Singapore after a decade of living overseas). Others think they have more benefits being foreigners for some odd reason (aunt has been a PR for 20 years). So, it depends on your wants and needs."

Domestic help is not a thing, people don't have maids here and it would cost too much anyway. But people still have more kids here. \n\nMoney and housing is a problem for anyone starting a family, so that's what Singaporeans complain about the most, but it's a problem everywhere.

I always found that when inviting Singaporean colleagues out for after work drinks they would come along only until the food showed up, shovel back as much as possible (company was paying, why not?) then make their excuses and leave. \n\nI guess it also depends why you're going out with work - I did it to make more connections and deepen the ties with others in the office, but if that seems like a stressful evening to someone born and raised here then I can understand why you wouldn't want to show up. No fun going out, dumping money on drinks AND not enjoying it."

We'll do it if we don't expect NEA agents to be lurking (as opposed to say in Orchard Rd). Our culture and governance haven't ingrained the idea that you do the right thing because it's ethical, you do the right thing because you suspect you'll get caught and disciplined if you don't. So when we have a reasonable expectation we won't get caught, many of us just go for it. "

From my first day in the UK and every time I popped down to London, there was *always* a delay on the tube. Travelling between Notts and Camb was hell during the commuter hours because of the crowds, worse that its hour+ journeys, and the trains were terrible. Even local transport was dodgy: I *hated* the buses in Notts because the bus captains generally give no fucks and having to juggle different payment methods for different buses was arse). The trams weren't too bad, but super small and the stations weren't very conveniently located. My wife would rather spend an hour walking to her classes instead of dealing with the Cambridge buses, which were worse than Notts.\n\nFoodwise, Singapore really is spoiled for choice in not just variety, but also the ability to go out and buy food at at time they feel like it. I never ever got used to literally everything shutting down at around 8-9pm."

Parents believe their child is special. If their child does poorly in school, it's the curriculum, not their child. The result is weak standards and students that rank lower than other developed countries in math, science, and reading.\n\nSingapore is definitely a pressure-cooker, but even those at the bottom would be considered above-average students in the US.

Oftentimes you see ppl on Facebook saying our tax is not low because we have to put 20% in CPF, 7% gst, custom duties, road tax, without realizing these taxes are present in other countries as well. \n\nTake for example Germany, max income tax is 45% with 5.5% surcharge, 19% VAT, inheritance tax of up to 50% and last but not least 10% social security tax which you will never get to see. Compare that with our CPF. Sure you can argue they get a lot more in return, but they pay a heck of lot more for it. In Germany, I would be in the 30% bracket compared to 10% in Singapore, I can use the money to buy the best healthcare plans possible and it would still be cheaper in Singapore.\n\nHow about the US then? My friends in NYC earning my equivalent in USD are paying more than 30% effectively with federal, state, property, social security and in some places even school district tax. I\u2019m not even counting the ~9% sales tax. And what do they get back? Zilch.\n\nLastly, CPF is not a tax, you can use the money for housing. Try doing that with pension funds in other countries."

But how much do they earn in comparison to singaporeans? You are comparing raw prices instead of affordability, and this is very dishonest. Also, how much more do you pay for gas in singapore? \n\nPublic transport in major European cities is absolutely superior to public transport in singapore, even in relatively poor countries such as Poland and Hungary. The only comparative advantage of public transport in singapore is that there aren't gypsies trying to steal your shit.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income\n\nTaxes: The median income is $43.5k (PPP) in the US, and  $32k (PPP) in singapore.

The important things are to know what the dangerous areas are, keep your wits about you (like learning how to tell quickly if an area is sketchy) and using common sense.\n\nThen there's the stereotype that everyone is fat, which is technically true for the US as a whole, but in the Bay Area, the majority of people are slim. I'm willing to bet that the average diet there is healthier than what people eat in Singapore.

As much as I hate the breakdowns of our public transport system, it at least exists (as opposed to most cities in the USA for instance). \n\nGST or VAT is actually quite a common tax in any developed country."

For high school students who go to Ivy's, the school isn't as large a factor as you think.  About 2% of my high school went Ivy and I was part of the group who went pseudo-Ivy.

Hence, CPF is not a tax by definition, but it is a tax in spirit.\n\nBy your definition, any investment product (whether it\u2019s bank deposits, bonds, unit trusts or shares) can also be considered a tax in spirit, since the whole point of these products is to make more money than they give out to you."

However, I believe that most Singaporeans would not be able to achieve such returns (with a similar risk profile)."

Just as how most singaporeans are better off paying tax and having the government build roads and hospitals, even though an intelligent few could conceivably have put their income tax money to even better uses. \n\nIt's just funny how everyone acknowledges that income tax is a tax, and a good thing indeed, but no one sees that CPF is pretty much identical in principle.

You will be able to get your shopping done through online stores like Lazada, Qoo10, or walking to the nearest mall. Amazon prime exists, but has less options than in the US.\n\n2) people love dogs. You can\u2019t keep some pets in public housing but if you move over in private housing there are no restrictions.\n\n3) dog sitting is Super common. There are pet shops that will do that service for you in many shopping Malls.\n\n4) leases are also expensive. $1600-1800 per month for \u201cnormal\u201d Japanese 5 seater cars. Very few SUVs because it\u2019s not popular and more expensive.\n\n5) credit scores don\u2019t exist. Your available credit is tied to your monthly income, credit history only matters if you repeatedly don\u2019t pay up. All major payment methods are accepted. MasterCard/visa/America expresss. We have many bank-linked mobile payments similar to Venmo. We don\u2019t have chase discover cards though.\n\n6) anywhere is good, public transportation is at most 5 mins away and runs every 15-40 mins at most. You can choose somewhere near a MRT station (our subway). It covers almost all of Singapore.\n\n7) discrimination here is far less than in the US. Unfortunately people here are less sensitive about such issues and can make very inappropriate statements.\n\n8) working from home / working remotely is not a norm. Some jobs allow working remotely a few times a month, but you are expected to be in the workplace the majority of the time. There are exceptions, but this is the general rule.\n\n9) yes, very easy. There are many maid employment agencies. But they are usually domestic workers, meaning they live with you and take care of Housekeeping / meals. Having a temp-maid is possible, but not the norm.\n\n10) childcare can be insanely expensive, especially for non-essential education (essential education is nearly free). We are an Asian culture where every resource is not spared in order to raise children. After-school tuition, music classes, sports classes, dance classes, daycares, you name it and it exists. The demand for such services by every single parent drives prices sky-high. It is not uncommon to spend several hundreds to thousands per month."

                "comment": "I will chime in on a few things where I have different info or opinions from other posters... my family and I moved from Texas to SG and lived in SG for nearly two years.\n\nRegarding dogs, you should check what breeds are allowed and which aren\u2019t. If either of your dogs has any pit bull in them (for example) you won\u2019t be able to import them. When you move, I advise you to look for a service to help with the paperwork. However, I advise you to look for an airline that will carry your dogs as excess baggage. Otherwise the cost of relocating your dogs will be very high... we paid nearly $10k to fly our dogs to Singapore as cargo. Flying them back to the US cost $400 as excess baggage.\n\nWith regards to cars, you should evaluate whether you really need a car. Cars are super expensive. Leases are expensive. For the amount of money you\u2019d spend on a lease or a purchase you could instead find a place close to the MRT and take taxis and come out ahead. Try living without one before you spend $150K+ SGD for a car you can keep for a max of 10 years.\n\nWith regard to discrimination, it isn\u2019t overt. But the culture is definitely mysogenistic.  People would talk to me first before my wife, and people coming to do work on our house almost always insisted in talking to me instead of my wife, even if I wasn\u2019t home. That really bothered her.\n\nRegarding maids, you can hire someone to come clean a couple of times a week, and the cost is probably comparable to hiring a maid in the US. You can also hire a live in maid, and her pay would be something on the order of $500-$800 SGD per month depending on experience. She will cook, clean, do laundry, run errands, get groceries, take care of kids and dogs, etc. You have to pay her salary and provide room and board.  Maids work six days a week, with Sunday\u2019s and public holidays off. Have our \u201chelper\u201d was the single best experience we had in Singapore. Worth every penny. We treated her well, and she loved our daughter and dogs. We stay in touch despite being back in the US for two years. Bonus... you won\u2019t need a dog sitter. \n\nOther bit of advice is to hire a professional in the US and another in SG to help handle income taxes.\n\nPM for more info or if you have additional questions.\n\n"

Nevertheless, Singapore has many online shopping portals and platforms that may serve you well.  \n\n2. Assuming you live in a private residence, it shouldn't be a problem technically.   \n\n3. We have Pawshake.  \n\n4. Can't help you much re: cars but leases are generally quite expensive as well. It may be more worth it to purchase a secondhand car.  \n\n5. Mastercard and Visa are common here. Sometimes AMEX. I don't think Singapore places as high an emphasis on credit score compared to the US (assuming you have stable employment).  \n\n6. Depends on your budget and lifestyle. Generally the expats seem to like the East (Marine Parade/East Coast) or the Holland Village area.   \n\n7. I don't really think there's discrimination against non-Mandarin speaking people unless they are disrespectful to Singaporean culture/rude. Not all Singaporeans speak Mandarin.   \n\n8. Not really common among the locals.  \n\n9. It's very easy to get part-time help. Just search part time cleaners on Google and you'll see lots of agencies (e.g. Helpling, Fuss).  \n\n10. I assume you are talking about child care in a private centre. For a foreigner, child care is likely to be expensive. For home, Singaporeans usually have live-in help, though part-time babysitters (from agencies) are also available but less common."

We have other e-commerce sites, but many of Amazon's services and products are unavailable here. Shipping also takes forever, as the items aren't stocked locally.\n\n\n\n> Dogs - we have 2 medium sized ones (25lb and 45lb) and wanted to see how sensitive people are especially when it comes to apartments here. I see there are a couple dog beaches on Sentosa which is pretty awesome. \n\n\n\nDogs are cool. Cats might be a problem though. (Cats disallowed in public housing)\n\n\n\n> Also related to dogs - dog sitting when we go on trips. We use a service in the states called Rover. It's basically Airbnb for dogs, and you can pick sitters based on price, location, etc. Is there something similar here?\n\n\n\nThere is. But can't comment as I haven't used it\n\n\n\n> I know how expensive it is to buy a car here, but what about leases? We currently lease a high-end SUV at home but was curious what kind of lease schemes are offered here. With 2 dogs and eventually kids, it would be helpful to have something where we can pack everything/everyone into a car.\n\n\n\n80-100SGD a day, plus fuel and parking.\n\n\n\n\n5. Credit cards / credit scores. How does that work here? It seems like Mastercard has a big footprint here, but what about American Express or Visa?\n\n\n\nVisa and MasterCard are most accepted here. (Almost everywhere) American Express is quite accepted. (by maybe 80% of shops?)\n\n\n\n\n> What are the best neighborhoods to rent an apartment in?\n\n\n\nJust rent away from the CBD, but close to your office\n\n\n\n\n> I've read about some controversies of discrimination against non-Chines / non-Mandarin speaking people - is that pretty prevalent or more just small instances making big headlines?\n\n\nMostly it's just employers listing speaking Mandrin as a job requirement. Hardly affects jobs like yours. Mostly only applies to jobs in the service sector.\n\n\nImho, don't worry too much. No one here would discriminate against a white/black man just because he can't speak Chinese. If you're Chinese on the other hand.. some less open minded people might not take too kindly to it. But that said, those people are the minority.\n\n\n\n> What's the attitude towards working remotely / working from home?\n\n\n\nWe get jealous that you're allowed to?\n\n\n\n\n> Is it pretty easy to get a maid to clean like twice a month? Or even someone to cook once a week?\n\n\n\nI there are agencies that offer such services. Worked at one as a student, but can't rmb the name\n\n\nLive in maids are more easily available, but you might find it unethical\n\n\n\n> How expensive is child care here?\n\n\n\nIm not very sure. Depends a lot on the quality of care, and number of hours a week. I know it usually costs 500-600 per month for locals, but i suspect expats might need to pay up to twice that."

Also, there is a list of dogs that are not allowed into singapore. Check out the AVA website. On mobile now. For apartments, it really depends on the individual management. \n3)not that I know of.

You can take the public transport (bus, train) or take Grab (something like Uber), its very affordable compared to owning a vehicle in Singapore\n\n5: Cards are accepted in most places, but not all, unlike U.S. \n\n6: Depends on what you judge as best, its pretty much safe everywhere in Singapore. There are different types of housing in singapore, \n\n* Public housing (HDB) - cheaper, no facilities, there are quota for foreigners renting\n* Private housing (Condo) - more expensive, rental is cheaper for units away from town, traveling is still fast if you compare vs traveling in US, usually comes with facilities such as gym, swimming pool, security  \nMost apartment comes with lifts, there are some walk up apartments\n* Private housing (landed) - a mini garden or patch of grass, space for 1-2 car park lot, slightly more expensive vs apartments (depending on location)\n\nFYI : Foreigners have to pay additional taxes for buying properties in Singapore. There are exceptions though, citizens from US do not have to pay additional taxes (you still to pay what a Singaporean has to pay though, something good to note if you are planning to settle here) [https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Property/Claiming-Refunds-Remissions-Reliefs/Remissions/Foreigners-Eligible-for-ABSD-Remission-under-Free-Trade-Agreements--FTAs-/](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Property/Claiming-Refunds-Remissions-Reliefs/Remissions/Foreigners-Eligible-for-ABSD-Remission-under-Free-Trade-Agreements--FTAs-/)\n\n7: Pretty much okay, only issue is if you get a bad neighbor. \n\n8: Maybe you want to elaborate more on what do you mean by attitude, if you are planning to work from home, you might want to check if you are eligible or find ways to go about doing it (your pass might not be valid to allow you to work)\n\n9: Easy to find\n\n10: Childcare and Education is insanely expensive for foreigners. I would say maybe 10-20k USD minimally. An expat would be in a better position to advise. "

Lived in both countries. OP can feel free to PM me with questions too!\n\n2. I assume OP will be renting, not buying (astronomical prices). Most landlords do not allow pets living in an apartment, especially dogs, you'll have to be really lucky to find someone who will allow them. I've rented twice here and both landlords don't even allow cats. You will have better luck renting landed properties that are pet friendly, which is of course more expensive. \n\n6. Dog friendly expat locales would be near the beaches (east coast and west coast area), bukit timah, Holland V, Botanic Gardens area. If you're willing to look at non expat locales there's good dog friendly parks at Bishan and Pasir Ris as well. \n\n7. Discrimination is less than in the US, yes. The worst is in retail where discrimination against non Chinese speaking people for sales position is common. However usually it's only Indians Malays or PRC that are discriminated against. If you're white, Latino, Arabic, etc etc.. or have American accent, you're probably fine. Sorry to be blunt but yeahhh. \n\n9. It's not just in-house domestic workers, there are also a bunch of cleaning agencies where you can get a cleaner weekly, biweekly, fortnightly, etc.. I'm sure once you've found someone you like and established a rapport, you'll be able to make your own arrangement with them to cook for you once a week. I've a weekly cleaner and I've had her babysit in a pinch before. Rate is usually 18-20/hr. \n\n10. Education for expat kids is insanely expensive but if OP's kid is young enough he doesn't have to worry about that yet. For childcare.. preschools run about 900 / month for half days and 1.6 / month for full days, but there's a huge variance in quality and price. Ad hoc babysitting is about 25/hr. \n\n"

The basic was that they would get 60% of what they spent back. There was a range where they would get 100% or so back, but I'm not too certain on that. The original plan was stated to last till 2015, and the govt looks to be sticking to it. Hope that (sorta) clarifies PIC!"

Towards the end of his long life (89) he suffered dementia. Terrible thing. He was a fit and mobile elderly before it struck him. We helped by continuously engaging in conversation with him, so that he remembers our name. We have a standard list of questions asked everyday so that he will remember the answer if someone outside asks. What's your name? Where do you stay? Ic number? \n\nAnd as long as he could still answer coherently and can move freely we let him wander around the estate to meet his coffeeshop kakis. We also convinced him to wear a tag, containing a card with important information, a whistle if he needs help, $30 for any taxi rides back home if he is lost and also a GPS tracker. Plus we got him those elderly phones with easy to dial numbers. We also asked his friends to keep a lookout for him. \n\nWhen he got worse, whoever was free in the family accompanied him around. It was important he had his freedom despite his condition but we still made sure someone was with him 100% of the time. If there's no one free, the maid goes with him. \n\nHe only got lost once in the five years he had dementia, and luckily he managed to find a kind NSF who helped him home because of the information he had on his tag. \n\nI think without family, it will be really hard for the elderly with dementia as they need something constant, and for someone to be there when they fall. If there isn't anyone, they will panic and start forgetting things they know and make the situation worse. "

You need land, facilities, faculty to keep an ongoing but hands-off watch over the populace, etc. You also need social buy in - elderly folk who are amenable to the arrangement, families who can \"let go\". \n\nBut certainly based on what I've read, it's a very positive and intriguing case study.

It isn't heavy so it's quite comfortable. \n\nThink the best thing you can do when talking to an elderly is find someone who can talk their preferred language be it malay/chinese. Calm them down, offer some water if you have. Sit down and then ask questions. If you can't handle it, best you call police officers and they will help a lot. "

It pains me to hear of your experience, but I'm glad these two old folks had gotten the help they needed.\n\nMy two cents on this (generically), and slightly repetitive.\n\nIn an ideal setting, greater community awareness would go a long way in supporting these elderly. We'd be better equipped if we know how to recognize dementia patients, and ways to communicate and assist them. The lack of awareness really impedes us from helping them, and understandably so (as evident from the experience of the two girls). We do have the [Forget Us Not](http://forgetusnot.sg/play-a-part.html) initiative in Singapore (and a guidebook), but it would be nice to have greater publicity on ground-up efforts like this and extend them to the larger public over time (tv adverts, or even share them with students in our schools - start them young). \n\nMoving forward, leveraging on technology would potentially have the greatest impact, e.g. in developing wearables (as mentioned) that can easily allow the public to identify a dementia sufferer, while at the same time easily accepted and not easily removed by the sufferer. Japan is actively looking into these [these](http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2016/12/to-help-residents-with-dementia-one-japanese-city-has-a-high-tech-fix/511343/), and I do hope that we could adopt or even collaborate with those at the forefront of this. \n\nUnfortunately with issues you mentioned (not wanting or forgetting to wear - you're right), together with a multitude of ethical/security/privacy concerns, an ideal and highly accessible tech solution that successfully deals with these issues has yet to be found. \n\nThe good thing is there's quite a great deal of research and innovation going into mobile health (IoT, wearables, sensors etc) for the past few years even in A*STAR, although much of this remains very nascent. I do hope to see a solution that would also leverage on the high smartphone and mobile broadband penetration rate here in Singapore in years to come though!"

However, patients confidentiality, volunteerism (to be tracked), different culture formed quite a lot of difficulties in making it work. Did I mentioned politics yet? *looking at various grassroot groups*\n\nMaybe the best solution can be the most fundamental and simplest one?"

                "comment": "Not OP, but I'd like to try to unpack it a little. \n\nConsent as a concept is very difficult to manage. For one, it's an \"active\" state of affairs (the consenting adult actively \"maintains\" the consent for the duration that he or she consents). This poses a problem for the patient - because dementia patients oscillate between lucid and non-lucid phases, their consent is suspect. Should we obtain the patient's consent prior to the onset of dementia? What happens if in a bout of lucidity the patient withdraws consent? What about patients who are already ill? If we defer to family, one major assumption is that the family has the patient's best interest at heart - as much as it's inconceivable, the family's interests may diverge from the patient's. \n\nFor another, it is difficult to prove for situations that are complicated. Who can really say, after the fact, that the patient was lucid when he or she made a particular choice? It's certainly clearer if the patient settled affairs (eg gave written consent witnessed and notarised as an affidavit, perhaps?) prior to the onset of the disease. It certainly would be a lot more complicated as the deterioration sets in. \n\nThird, and lastly, there is the issue of operationalising the system. Take organ donation as an example of how the general population is slow to take up a plan when it's \"opt-in\". HOTA was drafted as an \"opt-out\" because there just weren't enough donors. But you can't mandate all elderly or people diagnosed with dementia to be part of an \"opt-out\" system (issues of consent and bodily integrity are much harder to navigate when you're dealing with live people than dead bodies). If you run an \"opt-in\" system, then it becomes an inefficient system. \n\nI tried to make as much sense as I could. I hope my sharing of my thoughts is helpful. "

Also, most cell phone companies won't let you have a postpaid plan if you're here for less than a year. Generalizing a bit here, but most Singapore services think in terms of two-year contracts, so any stays shorter than that might cause a couple extra headaches. \n\nAnd speaking from experience, be careful crossing the road when you first get here, because the cars will be coming from the opposite direction you're used to. That was pretty terrifying for me at first.\n\nBut on the other hand, you'll quickly get used to the safety, the good food, the convenience of the public transport, the warm weather, the interesting people, and all the other fun things. I will miss this place when I have to leave."

The weather here alternates from super rainy to sweltering hot.\n\n* If you smoke, please smoke at designated areas (usually outside a building, trash can). Singapore has strict laws on smoking, even outdoors. I had many overseas friends who got fined just for smoking at the wrong place.\n\n* Alcohol law - No open bottle in public after 10pm\n\n* Haze - Indonesia burns stuff, haze comes here sometimes. Can be bad so keep a few N95 masks at home\n\n* Banks - Open at 9, some close at 4. Check if you need to do banking regularly. Cheques are collected at around 2pm every day and credited around the same time next day.\n\n* Cabs - Some cabs will take you where you want to go, most of the time cabbies pick and choose, and they're going elsewhere. To get a ride fast and hassle free, download apps like Grabtaxi and Uber. Pay a little bit more, but save time.\n\n* Telcos & Internet - There are 3 telephone companies here, Starhub Singtel and M1. All offer LTE/4G services, internet and some form of TV. All 3 are pretty regulated and offer similar services. There are no video streaming services like Netflix here yet, but you can torrent pretty much anything without getting into trouble.\n\n* Computer stuff - Go to Challenger or Funan IT Mall. Go to Epicentre/Nubox/iStudio for Mac and iPhone/iOS stuff. For computer components, monitors and IT stuff at good prices, you can try Sim Lim Square. If you need to get things from Sim Lim, I highly recommend asking r/Singapore first. :) There are some sneaky people there.\n\n* Furniture and household things - Go to Ikea at Alexandria or Tampines. Everything you need there. Pretty good food too!\n\n* Cultural areas to visit - Little India, Chinatown, Kampong Glam\n\n* Entertainment - Most cinemas are in town. For live performing arts, check out the Esplanade. Broadway shows and musicals usually play at Marina Bay Sands.\n\n* Bars and drinks places - Club street (Famous with expats, have a few expat friends living there. HAPPENING.) Timbre @ Substation & Timbre at The Arts House (Live music bar), Acid Bar, Alley Bar. If you want a bar with a view, try One Altitude.\n\n\nHope this is useful! If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\nIf you don't mind sharing, which area are you staying around? We can probably provide better suggestions for good food around the place."

There is a lot of construction work going on in Singapore and they sometimes work on weekends. Singapore's laws on noise control are undeveloped. You can have people drilling and hacking away next door over the entire weekend. \n\n* If you have any serious condition (cancer, learning disability, etc) that requires specialist care, do not use the public health service. Go for a private doctor. The public healthcare system is not as good as your HMO in the US, despite what the local nation-building press says. \n\n* Clothes dry more slowly in Singapore. Air drying is slow especially for bedding. Make sure you get an apartment with a dryer. \n\n* Ovens and dishwashers are uncommon in Singapore apartments. You'll have to request for them if you are leasing a condo apartment. \n\n* No central air like in the US. You'll be using the airconditioner every day, I guarantee. Singapore is more humid than Miami or Houston in summer. \n\n* No free soda refills at the McDonald's or other fast food chains. "

The spitting, jaywalking, chewing gums etc does not bother normal sensible people. There are so many people from so many parts of the world here that some ground rules makes everyones day so much better.\n\nWorry about your housing, there will be a lot of options once you arrive and you will have no idea about any of the areas or what prices are reasonable. Some areas costs a fortune, just moving a few minutes away or choosing a HDB can give you a lot better/bigger house for the same money. So i suggest you tell us the area or building where you will work, the type of house and surrounding you are looking for and perhaps you can get some good suggestions.\n\n\nHaving lived in Europe one thing to know is that things can move very fast in Singapore. When you order food during lunchhour and the aunty yells \"what u want?!, hey! hey! what u want?!\", dont take offence, its just efficiency over everything else. Play along and try to be efficient :)\n\nWhen people dont understand you or you dont understand people just talk in simple words and be understanding and patient. Learn some local Singlish words and people will open up very fast.\nSingapore is easy to adjust to, everything makes sense, everything is in English and everyone are very helpful. \n"

There is a lot of construction work going on in Singapore and they sometimes work on weekends. Singapore's laws on noise control are undeveloped. You can have people drilling and hacking away next door over the entire weekend.\n\n[More info here](http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/noise-pollution-control)\n\nBasically Sunday construction is for light works not involving a power drill of any kind."

The public healthcare system is not as good as your HMO in the US, despite what the local nation-building press says. \n\nTo be fair there are shitty doctors everywhere. Had to switch specialists for my son a few times. \n\nThe problem with the US system is usually specialists are affiliated with some hospitals and it can be very inconvenient or impossible to change providers due to politics or other reasons. At least in Singapore you can get whoever you want as long as you pay. \n\n"

It might just be your imagination, or that the staff might **appear** to be happier because they had to put up a front due to these interactions. \n\nAsians are just less talkative. Different cultures result in different definition of \"good service\", there is the need to take the local context into consideration. For example, Japanese staff often lower their heads or bow slightly when interacting with customers, does it then make sense for them to claim that service in New Zealand sucks because people over there do not do that? I don't think so. There isn't really a universal definition of \"good service\" past a certain point. In the words of the Americans, \"It's nooo yerk over here\", a busy environment always has its limitations.\n\n\\**Both I and my friends have worked at restaurants as part-timers, we offer the same service to the customers regardless of whether they strike up a conversation, that's a fair treatment, no? It makes no sense to treat certain customers better or worse, that's unprofessional. Also, the days are often extremely busy, service staffs want to minimise delays and move on to the next table/order while the kitchen pushes stuff out.* "

I also like the fact that OP thinks that just because he's white, he suddenly has a target on his back. Malaysia has butt-load of tourists everyday so nobody really gives a damn. You're more likely to be robbed in cities like NY/Paris/London than in a place like Malacca. If your car is a luxury car, you don't really need to worry about security. All of the luxury cars nowadays have onboard GPS, keyless ignition and some can be remotely disabled if requested. Your car would only be stolen if you are naive enough to park it at a secluded area overnight. Nobody gonna touch your car if you park it in a mall, hotel, public carpark or even at a roadside near the mamak stall. Just be vigilant. Don't leave your belongings in your car. \n\nThe exaggeration here is too much. Malaysia has MANY luxury cars on the road, your car is not THAT special. I find it funny that people here talk as if Malaysia is so poor to the point that car hijacking is a daily occurrence. \n\nSource: stays in both countries and owns a Mercedes."

Add a lot of miscellaneous transport expenses and you should be able to keep it to less than $150 a month per person on transport without too much hassle.\n\nBuy your goods at NTUC, Sheng Shiong or the wet market. The $10 melon is from Medi-ya which is more of a specialised store downtown that mainly sells Japanese goods. I won't be surprised if you find $100 grapes, but don't use that for comparison. If you really want to find the absolute best deal, try this site https://www.diffmarts.com/. It gives price comparisons for the major supermarkets in Singapore (including RedMart). NTUC always has random sales for random fruits depending on season. There's a $1.90 for 250g blueberries sale going in at least three NTUCs I visited in the past week. Cold Storage is another chain that we all know as slightly more upmarket in terms of price and products. If you live near a town centre (e.g. Woodlands, Tampines, Jurong) you can probably get more than one supermarket to choose from.\n\nYou can also get great food from hawker centres. There's at least one near you in every town. You can get a good variety of food for a very good price (think less than $5 a meal). Which is to say you don't have to force yourself to cook every day if your schedule doesn't permit, there's affordable food all around.\n\nA mid-tier restaurant would set you back about $15-20 per person. Movies on the weekends cost about $14 depending on theater.\n\n"

Hawker centre food may be cheap but it generally lacks fresh fruits and vegetables. Portion sizes are also smaller if you are coming from the US. Most Singaporeans eat a lot of hawker food because they don't cook or don't have the time to. \n\nIf you are into salads, then bear in mind that leafy vegetables like spinach, arugula (also called rockett), lettuce, etc are not cheap in Singapore although they are readily available in most larger NTUC stores. Greek-style salads of tomatoes and cucumbers are however more economical although the variety and quality of tomatoes in Singapore are not great. Yellow/red onions and bell peppers are also not cheap in Singapore. Extra-virgin olive oil is  expensive in Singapore as relatively few people eat it. However, you can try making dressing with sesame oil. I personally bring a few bottles/cans of olive oil back to Singapore whenever I go to Australia where it is much cheaper. \n\nMy wife and I prepare our own lunches everyday for health reasons. We usually make salads or bring leftovers. I estimate that a salad would cost us around $4 to 5 each.   A diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables is definitely possible and economical if you make a bit of effort. "

The 'local vegetables' consist of bean sprouts, spring onions, cabbage and chinese spinach. No salads, or the likes. Plenty of preserved vegetables if you're into that sort of thing\n\nA very large fraction of our 'local' vegetables (e.g. Chinese Leek) come from the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia. These vegetables are generally not native to the tropics either and can only be grown in cool places like the Cameron Highlands. Something is not quite right if we are eating the same kind of 'local' vegetables as people living in China. \n\nThe reason why spinach and other 'western' vegetables are air-flown into Singapore is because they are not popular enough for farms in the Cameron Highlands to grow and export to Singapore. There just isn't enough demand in Singapore for such vegetables currently but they probably can be made 'local' if people wanted to eat them. "

                "comment": "Local brown person here, I love writing long stories :) - Singapore is a cultural paradox. It is a country of so many immigrants, and now it's experiencing a new wave of immigrants - realistically speaking, it's very impressive for the number of different cultures/races/ethnicities all squashed together on our tiny, red dot to still exist in peace and harmony. The last thing Singaporeans want is a clash of cultures - we had riots in the 60s and nobody wants that to happen again. So we try our best to live in harmony, even if we don't like our neighbour, we keep our thoughts to ourself and smile and carry on. \n\nThe crazy influx of immigrants starting in the 80s has built up a sort of apprehension towards foreigners in general. Then we start lumping the foreigners into groups: some groups are more tolerated and welcome than others. Reality shows that India-Indians and China-Chinese are among the not-so-liked at the moment. But do remember, back in the 80s, HongKongers were despised, because there was a large exodus before HK went back under Chinese rule. \n\nOne prevalent aspect of 'local' culture is to be always (somewhat) tolerant of your noisy/smelly fellow local neighbour. Racial harmony is always so very hammered into our heads in school - so most of us know how to behave even if our true feelings aren't that nice. The sudden shock of the more recent influx of immigrants, not just from China and India, has thrust a huge wave of new behaviours and habits upon us. Suddenly, it's okay to push and shove on the bus, or talk SO loudly, or gather in ridiculously large numbers and block the sidewalk, stare at local girls like they've never seen a girl before, be generally obnoxious.... (I realize these are stereotyped behaviours, but it's what people tend to see.) \n\nThen it becomes a case of them vs. us. And Singapore's small size and limited resources means that this is a harsh reality - good schools, places to live, are all up for grabs. If someone shoves you on the bus, it's bad enough, but if that person happens to be an immigrant (and even worse, a rude one who doesn't apologize or see the error in their way) the local dude is going to think \"Goddamn immigrant taking up MY space, shoving me on MY bus. You can push in your country, but here we wait our turn.\" Not the best, but humans are entitled to their emotions and stakes are high on public transit. Same goes for the few Indian families that may have trashed some rental properties - once bitten, twice shy.\n\nIt is just a clash of cultures, and I do believe locals feel that immigrants are the ones that need to take that extra step to meet us, since we accepted you into our turf. It's not that we don't like you, but logically, if you come here, than you have to change some things, not us. You have to be culturally-sensitive towards us, if you would like the same in return. If it is a huge issue, then get involved in politics and try to change the laws - it's been done.\n\nFun anecdote - when I was growing up in the 90s, we had an Indian family move into next door. Boy were they stuck up as hell! Never smiled/said hello, etc. My mum tried to chat and was met with curt responses. Pretty much slammed the door in her face while she was saying \"have a nice day.\" The kid went to the same school as me, and he was a little snotty brat. So there - image ruined. If you consider yourself a nice immigrant, you have people like these to thank for ruining it for all of you. \n\nLocal Indians are also often looked down by these immigrants who bring their caste system with them - that lady asked my mum what caste we were (my family is mostly Tamil, but several generations in Singapore has given us some mixed blood), and then gave a look of disgust when my mum said we don't observe castes here. This has happened numerous times with Indian expats. Hell, I live in Canada now, and I've been asked by Indian immigrants what my caste is. Srsly??? (I feel like telling them to go back to India!)\n\nThe same can be said for people from China. Stereotypically, they are greedy and rude. They are the ones cutting in line and ruining your day. Perhaps, but there are also nice ones. \n\nWell, I'm rambling. But my point is, (and as an immigrant in another country myself), I can guarantee you that if you take the initiative to make the first step, to build that bridge, life will get better. The reality is you have to prove yourself. Don't distance yourself from the stereotypes - instead forward-thinking people like you could be thinking of ways to integrate better. Why do those stereotypes exist? If there are douches buying up swaths of property, driving up prices, then that douche is exploiting the system and depriving locals (and honest immigrants) of a decent living. And it happens so often, it becomes a trademark of that immigrant group. \n\nThey are making you look bad, so maybe you can do something about it? Blaming the locals isn't going to help, even if they are a tad belligerent. If you formed a club that educated your fellow Indians on local customs, and how not to ask what caste local Indians belong too, or how not to talk extremely loudly in public places, then you would have made a difference. If a Chinese that shares the same sentiments as you makes an effort to educate his fellow countrymen on how pushing and shoving on the train and coughing without covering your mouth is rude, then we locals will thank him.\n\nBesides, there is a good number of immigrants (from all over) who are in Singapore JUST to milk it. So there is no respect, there is no love, it's just a grab-all-you-can-fest. If the locals are slow and polite, then they are suckers..... There's that sentiment too. You may not feel that way, but there are several who do. So maybe you can help change that feeling. You are well-educated and liberal. Why don't you write to the paper, or any of the publications geared toward immigrants on how to better integrate?\n\nAnd don't take it too personally when you get told \"No Indians\" when trying to rent. Local Indians (I'm 4th generation Singaporean, don't even quite know my Indian ancestors), get the same rule applied (sometimes). And think of it this way - you probably don't want to live in a place where the landlord is a douchey racist, right?\n\n"

Those that try to integrate and have become our friends are welcome, and those who stick within their cliques, make no attempt to integrate and stick out like sore thumbs in public with their behaviour are the ones we complain about. \n\nSingaporeans are more than welcoming to the first type of foreigners. Take Malaysians(who comprise of ethnic chinese, malay and indian) for example, they have historically been immigrating here in large numbers and Singaporeans have been generally very accepting of them because they blend in really well. So its not a issue of race, but rather behaviour.\n\nWhen Singaporeans complain about Indians and Chinese, they're not really targeting the race in particular, but their behaviour and mannerisms. So if you don't exhibit any of these offending traits like looking down on local Indians(who are mostly Tamil) because of their higher caste back in India, talking really loudly and obliviously on public transport, BO etc you won't have to worry about being discriminated against.\n\nI've travelled widely and yes explicit racism is uncommon. Being patronized due to my ethnicity however is another story."

After a decade of an insane immigration and housing policy for a first-world country, there is bound to be a reaction from the urban population. The fact of the matter is that most first world countries at least have a policy which makes it a law that in order for a company to hire a foreigner, he needs to prove that there is no suitable local to do the job has artificially debased wages for a segment of the population. This is still not in place in Singapore with intent. \n\nThis is also a reason why basic services in Singapore are so cheap (what other country as developed as ours can you get $5 for a meal, private GP consultation for <$30, reasonable transport costs for taxis and trains etc.)  but in order to do that I estimate 35% of the population who do not have Poly or University education are shit stuck in a terrible situation."

So its not a issue of race, but rather behaviour.\n\nThis is true.  If people are going to come into Singapore, and obtain citizenship, doesn't it make sense that they're supposed to fit in, and become more \"local\", behaviour-wise?  \n\nIf they're not going to become citizens, or even attempt to blend in to our culture, why should they get the benefits of our Singapore?  \n\nWhen I go to other countries, people always tell me, \"Try to follow what the locals do.\" and \"Don't expect stuff to be like Singapore, because you'll be sorry.\"  Maybe these people coming into Singapore don't have anyone to tell them that."

The vast majority of the time the official line on things like racial tensions or racism or things like that isn't 'guys, let's try to understand each other' as much as it is 'welp we have to live together, let's *tolerate* each other because there's no choice'.\n\nVery often you'll hear similar sentiments echoed in things people say- or I've heard, at least- people being sort of openly dismissive or racist against other people and then justifying it or saying it's okay because they wouldn't do it to their faces / they have friends from that race so that makes it fine / they're *tolerating* them, that doesn't mean they have to *like* them. \n\nUltimately even if 'let's tolerate' is a successful means of addresses the surface issues, whatever underlying tensions there are still remain totally unaddressed and unacknowledged, and very often bringing them up will get you labelled as a bit of a shit-stirer. It's definitely something that's more than a bit annoying; that raising discussion on unpopular opinions is seen more as bringing up trouble than as trying to address it. "

However if business owners have to pay this much, where do they get the profits from? It will have to come from the public.

                "comment": "\"No incentives because i chose the highest fares available and my AR drop to 40%.\"\n\nWell if you're driving for Grab, that's your mistake right there. Right now their passenger rates are really low, so to compensate their driver bonuses are really high. Skipping the bonuses is quite a bad idea.\n\nI drive regularly for Grab, I make about $25 an hour after petrol and Grab's incentives (but before considering the rather large cost of a car). You can rent most cars for under $75 a day, so it takes 21 hours a week of driving to pay for the car itself. After that, $5-600 in my pocket per week. A lot of that is the incentives... Grab basically controls their driver supply through the incentive systems. No incentive at all is really painful.\n\nEdit: I don't really know the specifics of the Tribecar deal. It might not actually be worth it. But from what I can see, the other half of your problem is that your total # of trips + fares is really awful. During the same time period today, I drove nine trips, total fare of $121.50 (which is actually pretty low), and my incentives should end up somewhere around $35 I think. So if you'd made $155 gross, you'd have netted about $93. Not great for six hours, but not awful for a job that lets you sit in aircon and socialize. Better than the grease pits of McDs...\n\nExtra extra edit: Why the heck are you making three stops for petrol? That's a huge time sink, given that you're paying so per hour to rent the car. Is this some part of Tribecar's deal? If so that does suck. If not... refuel once only, on the way back to the car depot. "

                "comment": "Food\n\n$4-5 is more than enough for a meal at a hawker center. Plenty of hawker centers even in the Central Business District. About $8 will get you a meal at an air-conditioned food court. Restaurants, bistros and cafes start at $10 and can go up to the sky as Singapore is home to some very expensive dining options. Note that prices at most restaurants and bistros are exclusive of goods and services tax (consumption tax, 7%) and service charges (10%) - look out for the ++ sign or fine print.\n\nGroceries are cheap at local supermarkets, but the quality of groceries here is not as high as the typical Japanese or American supermarkets. Some examples of prices are: $2.50 for 5 China Fuji apples, less than $1 for a clump of enoki mushrooms, about $5 for a bag of instant coffee packets. The large expat community here means there are specialty supermarkets that cater to them. Some bigger ones include [Marketplace by Jason's](http://www.marketplacebyjasons.com/mpjshop/en/html/index.html) and the Japanese supermarket Meidi-ya. Prices are higher at specialty supermarkets.\n\nTransport\n\nIf you aren't owning a car, Singapore has one of the cheapest public transport systems among big cities in developed countries. Bus, train, and light rail share a distance fare system where the final cost of a trip is charged based on distance traveled, regardless of number of transfers taken. A trip from the suburbs into the city will usually cost no more than $2.\n\nTaxis are also relatively cheap, starting at about less than $4 for most types of taxis. Trips are all metered and drivers stick strictly to the meter (no need to bargain) and there is no tipping culture. There is an arcane system of surcharges that you have to take note of, the major ones being the peak hour surcharge (25% of metered fare) and midnight surcharge (50% of metered fare). There is often no need to book a taxi because they are plentiful. You can find out more here: http://www.taxisingapore.com/taxi-fare/\n\nPhone\n\nPrepaid cards are cheap and have 6 month durations before you need to top up the card. They start at $5 (with an initial SIM card fee) and can be topped up at various values, the most common being an $18 card. Mobile internet packages are available for prepaid subscribers, coming at 100MB packages to 3GB packages with varying durations. Money is taken from the stored-value card and there are no hidden fees. An example of a package for a heavy user is a 3GB package that lasts for 50 days costing $30, to give you an idea of how much it costs.\n\nYou can get more information from the websites of the three main mobile carriers in Singapore - M1, Starhub, and Singtel. M1 and Starhub are probably more relevant because they have the most comprehensive prepaid plans. If you are here for an extended period of time (2 years+), consider a contract because they are relatively cheap.\n\nEntertainment\n\n$10+ for a movie ticket. Video games are a mixed bag because we have Asian versions, but are generally more expensive than in the US because we do not have mega retailers like Amazon. Plenty of concerts, plays, recitals, musicals etc. that start as cheap as free with world-class acts coming in every now and then.\n\nTourist attractions are extremely expensive. The zoos here cost almost $40 for entrance, a one day pass at Universal Studios Singapore costs $74, taking a ride on the Singapore Flyer costs over $20. Not to say there aren't cheap attractions in Singapore - museums are quite cheap, and there are places off the beaten track like Pulau Ubin that costs $2.50 for a one-way bumboat ride that features some diverse ecosystems and a glimpse at old Singapore.\n\n$30++ for a night of clubbing, alcohol is extremely expensive here ($2.50+ for 330ml of semi-decent beer at the supermarket, the same 330ml turns into $6 at restaurants, drinks at clubs start at $6 and go all the way up)."

It shouldn't cost an extra $1000. AIA sells it. You don't have to buy the excess coverage from the car rental agency. Charging rental insurance is actually how these agencies make money. "

Factoring in all the various extra fees, etc. will bump this up. To make things worse, you have no CPF to help offset the upfront costs you will incur.\n\nDisclaimer: Not a property agent.

(not the agent, not the agent's company etc. unless the seller is a company. do a title search via SLA's website for $5 to verify the owner is correct). if you decide to proceed with the deal, the option period is normally 2 weeks, and to exercise the option, pay 4% (or 9%, depending on the terms). this amount will be paid to the seller's LAWYER under the lawyers conveyancing account (it will be paid to LEGAL FIRM NAME-CVY)\n6. depends on bank.\n7. honestly .. depends on the banker and your luck.\n8. increasing interest rates, finding a gf (and not having enough cash flow). property being vacant for a long period of time (law has been changed and you will still pay property tax on the prevailing rental even if property is empty)\n\ndont believe all those bullshit fliers/advertisements .. i deal with agents everyday. you never get the full truth, and once you have paid for the property, you will LLST when there is a problem.\n\nbecause you are self employed, you will have a more difficult time with the loan process.\n\ni work for an investment company and do this for a living, managing, buying,selling etc. if you don't have a medium to long term outlook/holding power.. dont bother getting into the market at current prices.\n\nalso- do not forget that if you buy your first property and its cheap (ie 3% stamp duty on 600k is not much) but for the second property (if you are that lucky quickly enough), you will pay ABSD as long as the rule is in place.\n\nwell, i hope that helps for now. if you want me to check transaction prices for a building for you, i can pull up 10 years worth of data for you. if you are worried about telling me the building name, just give me the postal district (ie, orchard road = 9) and ill generate the entire district's data for you. you can sift through it and find the building you are targeting yourself."

How about buying a conservative exchange traded fund (ETF?). The trading account is free at Standard Chartered and if you buy an emerging market government bond etf you could probably get around 4% yield a year.  \n\nMeaning for every SGD 10,000 you put in you receive about SGD 400 per year. If you are really interested in investing in property you could just buy a REIT ETF and have the same thing. \n\nIf I were you I would read the following: http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%27_Guide_To_Investing and then invest in a well diversified portfolio of index funds.\n\nYou will get more passive income that way and you can add money in every month from your paycheck without having a loan and paying interest."

                "comment": "I think u should stay closer to the east. Commuting in the morning and evening peak hours is horrible even in a car. So, the closer u stay, the less time u waste travelling. It's much less crowded on weekends, so even if u wanna head to the more happening parts of Spore, it's not going to take very long. Also, no need to feel awkward anywhere in Singapore. People may stare once in a while, but foreigners are no strangers to this small country"

                "comment": "Assuming that the company gives you a travel allowance -- it likely makes sense to stick with the CBD area (the Quays maybe ChinaTown) and take cabs. The key thing to keep in mind is that you will be going AGAINST traffic when commuting, so you will rarely be stuck.\n\nPM me if you want specific condo recommendations that give easy access to the ECP.\n\nStill - if you decide to go the 'near the job' route...stick as close to the ECP as possible. Best area for your purpose is probably Marine Parade (walkable, beach nearby, lots of restaurants/shopping/etc) "

Street names are terribly, terribly English, reflecting the age of the area.  The Australian school is close by, so popular choice for many expat families.  Traffic on weekends is its biggest hassle."
