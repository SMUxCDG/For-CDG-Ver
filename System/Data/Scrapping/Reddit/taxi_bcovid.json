i don\u2019t know.\u00a0as far as grab\u2019s contractual obligation admittedly i will say i don\u2019t know. i said what i said because the driver was on the phone with grab\u2019s support staff on loudspeaker, and i asked \u201cif i\u2019m already in the car and made the booking and he didn\u2019t cancel before hand, is he obliged to drop me at my destination\u201d. the service staff on the phone replied the driver with \u201csorry mr koh, but you do have to drive them there\u201d. that\u2019s when the aggression on his end escalated and i had no intention to fight.\u00a0i\u2019ll say this for the last time - what i posted on facebook was done out of character and not something i would typically do. it\u2019s not a valid excuse and it is something that was clearly wrong of me. so this apology here goes out to everyone and anyone who felt that i went overboard. you can continue thinking i\u2019m full of crap, am a joke or whatever. but on my end, i am officially apologising for letting my emotional bias and state cloud my logic and rationality. i will face the consequences for my actions (on the phone with the npc io i did mention that if he\u2019s not going to give me the officer\u2019s identity, i will pay for it).\u00a0but all that being said, tl;dr, this is not me flip flopping. this is me realising what i did was out of character, wrong, and not right to do so. i will be deactivating social media just to take some time to reflect on these actions of mine. for the ones who said mean things here on this thread i think you have every right to because what i did was rude, condescending, very overboard and not right at all however much you wanna think it\u2019s a csb or true. but for the ones who spoke kindly after i explained myself, i thank you for the kindness.\u00a0i\u2019ll freely admit this - my personal life has taken a huge hit this past month and i have not been the most stable person out there. to the one who suggested i need help, i\u2019m not ashamed to share on a public forum i\u2019ve been seeking psychiatric treatment (reason i don\u2019t drive) and counselling. but again, this is no excuse for my behaviour. the driver and officers did me wrong, but i should have handled the situation better.\u00a0i don\u2019t ask that you accept my apology or for this backlash to stop. i know when i wake up there will be more criticism and i\u2019m prepared for it.\u00a0but as of right now, i apologise to every soul here who has taken offence to my actions and words. this is me genuinely saying i\u2019m sorry, this is not something i would usually do, i acted out of character, and you guys have taught me that i should not just think twice but in fact ten times before i react out of emotional anger. i will be thinking twice about the lawsuit regarding the driver (on hindsight my second option is overboard as someone pointed out how he was just doing his job and he has a family to feed). but sexual harassment is not right, and i will find a way to contact him, and i will make an effort to try and get him to understand why i was offended by his actions. as far as the police are concerned, the io knows i want to report the officer and what\u2019s i said about paying for his information. the use of the word \u201cbounty\u201d came across too much, and again it was wrong of me. i will be a man and face whatever consequence they throw at me for my actions. i\u2019d like to thank the ones here to reminded me of the illegal bits of what i posted - when you\u2019re blinded by anger it\u2019s easy to say things without thinking.\u00a0whether you think this is a faux apology i can\u2019t control what you think. but this is the sincerest way i can think of to apologise to the community.\u00a0i am genuinely sorry for overreacting, being rude, overbearing, arrogant, and just being an all around douchebag. i humbly apologise to anyone who reads this.\u00a0goodnight."

(they were a pain once when they blocked me for cancelling many times, but otherwise the service is great.)"

(there's one taxi brand that seems to have more than their fare share of dubious characters/likely triad members as drivers, but their reputation is getting around).in other words, it's like democracy in singapore. there are cabs on the street, just as there are mps in parliament, leading the unwary to assume that those things work pretty much as they do elsewhere. attempting to put that assumption into useful practice is rarely as successful as betting one's entire income on the 4d. (providing yet another demonstration of the word \"assume\" as shorthand for \"making an @$$ out of u and me\".)having a taxi system in singapore that functions comparably to those elsewhere will, like anything else benefitting the ordinary person here, take a change of government priority more than sufficient to require a change of government."

speeding in his direction at a signalised cross junction, but he decided to make the discretionary right turn anyway.> yap kok hua\u2019s actions ended up costing one of his passengers, a 19-year-old, her life.\u00a0> another passenger, a 22-year-old, suffered traumatic brain injuries and multiple fractures, and remained in a vegetative state for some time.> on wednesday (july 17), yap pleaded guilty to one charge of causing the death of kathy ong kai ting by a negligent act, and one charge of causing grievous hurt to mr zon lim, mr lim jin jie and mr ting jun heng, who were all 22 years old at the time.> they were studying at the national university of singapore (nus) then \u2014 ong was a first-year environmental studies student.> two other charges of causing hurt to the driver of the car he collided into, and failing to ensure his rear seat passengers were wearing a seatbelt, will be taken into consideration for sentencing on aug 2.> deputy public prosecutor (dpp) timotheus koh told the court that yap has a history of minor traffic offences dating back to 1992. most recently, he was fined for speeding in 2014 and failing to conform to a red light signal in 2016.> the prosecutor also noted that accidents at traffic junctions were flagged as a \u201cgrave concern\u201d by the authorities last year.> from january to april 2018, 38 people died from fatal traffic accidents \u2014 four more than the same period the previous year.> the issue of discretionary right turns also recently received an airing in parliament, with two members of parliament calling for their removal.\u00a0> such junctions are projected to be discontinued in five years, but one mp, lim sun sun, urged the land transport authority to shorten the time to prevent more accidents.\u00a0> for causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, yap could be jailed up to two years, fined, or both.\u00a0> for causing grievous hurt by a negligent act, he could be jailed up to two years, fined up to s$5,000, or both. he could also face a driving ban.> what happened> the court heard that yap picked up his four passengers at clementi mall on april 19 last year at about 7.30pm. they then set off for tembusu college, a residential hostel in nus.> mr zon lim sat in the front seat, while the other three, including ong, sat in the back.> they had only been on the road for two minutes when they arrived at the junction of commonwealth avenue west by clementi road.> when the traffic light turned green, yap moved forward into the right turn pocket, stopping to check for vehicles coming from the opposite direction.> he saw mr ng li ling, 21, speeding towards him, but decided to turn right into mr ng\u2019s path. both vehicles collided into each other, while the taxi also hit another stationary car at the junction.> the taxi and mr ng\u2019s car were both severely damaged. at the time, visibility was good, the weather was clear and traffic flow was light.> video footage of the accident from yap\u2019s in-car camera was played in court.> an analysis by the health sciences authority (hsa) found that mr ng had been driving at between 92 km/h and 97 km/h. the speed limit there was 70 km/h. yap was travelling at about 24 km/h then.> a further hsa report stated that if mr ng had kept to the speed limit, they could have likely avoided the collision.> all four victims were taken to the national university hospital, where ong was pronounced dead at about 10.30pm.> mr ting suffered severe brain injuries and was vegetative, but managed to get better. he was hospitalised for 54 days and referred to tan tock seng hospital, where he is still undergoing rehabilitation.> mr lim jin jie suffered a fracture, among other injuries. he stayed in hospital for eight days and was given 144 days of medical leave.> meanwhile, mr zon lim was kept on a neck brace and hospitalised for eight days. he was given 23 days of medical leave.> \u2018horrific collision\u2019> dpp koh sought eight weeks\u2019 jail and a five-year driving ban for yap, citing the death and serious injuries that resulted from the \u201chorrific collision\u201d.> yap\u2019s lawyers, mr josephus tan and mr cory wong, asked for a slightly lower jail term of six weeks.> mr tan pointed out that yap had \u201cstopped intermittently at the turning pocket and checked for oncoming traffic\u201d, which was \u201cin stark contrast to the typical dangerous driving or even careless driving\u201d.> yap was also not speeding then, while the accident could have been avoided if the other driver was not speeding, mr tan added.> however, dpp koh said that nr ng\u2019s speeding should not be a mitigating factor, as yap had displayed negligent behaviour.> \u201cthe accused was aware of danger approaching but he decided to run the risk anyway\u2026 the headlights of the oncoming vehicle were clear and visible,\u201d he added.> today understands that action will be taken against mr ng.> ---1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "lots of reasons, and combinations of reasons.  i'll speak specifically to the usa since i was raised here and this guy is from here.1.) most places have strict laws about cabbies refusing rides to passengers.  the law is on the side of the passenger here almost all the time.  that happened during the civil rights era, when cabbies wouldn't give rides to black people.  people feel entitled to a ride no matter what the cabbies disposition is toward them, and the law supports that.  this guy was denied a ride for a bs reason, really, even if it was technically illegal it's such a minor infraction so as to be completely irrelevant in most countries.  i've hailed taxis in the middle of a high-speed highway in nyc, in the middle of the night when there was no traffic.  illegal, but who cares.  now if i specifically found myself in this situation in singapore (or anywhere) i would find an alternative and forget about it, but this guy is on a crusade against all of singapore's unjust and cruel laws, based on his post history.  this isn't common among the general populace, but in the extreme right libertarian american is a righteous indignation against all unjust laws, no matter how trivial they want to impeach the president over it.2.) cabbies are generally old men in singapore, and old people in singapore demand a level of respect that we are not raised to care about.  our parents are the hippies, the \"call me by my first name\" types who didn't want to be like the stuffy \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" elders of their time.  we feel comfortable talking to a 60 year old uncle the same way we would talk to a 20 year old.  the 60 year old singaporean is generally super indignant and uncomfortable with that in cases of conflict, feeling the youth should give way to them.  this righteous indignation may cause taxi men to escalate confrontations that don't need escalating, and drunk passengers will be all too willing to worsen the escalation.  i don't have any personal experience with this, i like to strike up a conversation with a taxi uncle if they're willing, and they've always been super nice to me.  this opinion is based on interactions with my new singaporean family-in-law, i expect some taxi uncles must have this sort of disposition when they're confronted with behavior they consider unacceptable.3.) civilians cannot detain people here except under very serious, specific situations.  felonies, purse snatching and shoplifting are some examples of this (depending on jurisdiction) but petty squabbles are not.  so we're raised to believe that it's ok to kick the shit out of someone doing this to us.  if he really did snatch the guys stuff, then that is grounds enough for civilian detention even in most of the us.4.) racism / classism.  people generally look at a cabbie as a servant, not an equal, and are likely to treat them as such.  due to singapore's unique situation, that maybe isn't how you all feel about it, but in the usa our cabbies are most often uneducated immigrants who barely speak english.  in some cities i've been to they're rude as hell which can help foster a huge disrespect for their field.  if you are in a smaller city, you may have a low-paid local driver, but it's rare to find that.  i've worked in the service industry, and dealing with righteous holier-than-thou customers every day is a brutal, soul draining experience.  it takes a strong disposition to take that crap every day and stay polite.  so i imagine the taxi men may have a short fuse when it comes to indignant, uppity foreigners and maybe they try to put them in their place, escalating confrontations with asshole foreigners.these are obviously just stream-of-thought guesses, but it looks like i wrote a thesis on it now.  what has to be the #1 reason is that drunk people can be aggressive and extremely illogical in their interactions.  cabbies are their only transportation option late at night.  therefore some of that aggression is going to be taken out on the cabbies."

                "comment": "it was reported like an onion news in intl media. when other countries are deciding on how much of subsidies, we slap it with a surcharge!?the surcharge and test was ridiculous on many levels:1. tailpipe tests run on used cars due varied engine conditions determining exhaust fumes , but tesla has no engine nor tailpape emissions. no test is required. efficiency is determined by design and driving conditions. new or used stock evs are the same. 2. they couldn't run a tailpipe test in this case, so they pointed to production of electricity, to insist ev produces co2. to level the comparison, they should also account c02 for production and distribution of petrol/diesel. and what if i decided to charge my car by solar and energy storage? 3. 444wh/km is too way off. the model s can easily averages 200wh/km (based of figures from existing owners). a model 3 can pull off a 160wh/km. instead of acknowledging flaws in testing and classifying evs, they doubled down and slapped it with a surcharge."

let's say i value donuts at 1u each (5u) and you value donuts at 5u each (25u). then, by giving all 10 donuts to you, we increase the total surplus from 30u to 50u. we have obtained an *allocative* improvement by 20u, but only by hurting me by 5u. this happens to be a kaldor-hicks improvement because you can pay me 5+\u03f5, and i am now better off by \u03f5 while you are also better off by 25-\u03f5. we have gained both pareto and allocative improvements through a k-h transfer.---the reason i mentioned it is because the conclusion that competitive markets are efficient comes from the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics, which briefly states that 1) any walrasian (competitive) equilibrium is pareto efficient, and 2) any pareto efficient point can be accomplished with a combination of endowment redistribution and letting the free market take over. as we can see from the donut example, we had *a* pareto-efficient outcome (5 donuts each), but not necessarily an allocatively efficient outcome (10 donuts to you). in a sense, the price mechanism can fail to generate max efficiency - we didn't include prices, but you can introduce prices, endowment ~~and asymmetry~~ (not needed) to demonstrate this. not all improvements can be k-h improvements. this is a more general statement about price not guaranteeing efficiency, not directly targeted at the taxi market.---in general, any imperfection in the market generates allocative inefficiency. this includes monopoly power, barriers to entry (such as cost or regulations), information asymmetry (where one party knows more than another) and so on. the taxi market here demonstrates all of these factors, which is why the price mechanism can fail to bring about \"efficiency\".one might wonder why, at the beginning, i said that a classical demand-supply leads to efficiency while here, i said that the price mechanism can fail in doing that. the gist of it is that the models are different - when markets are imperfect, one party, either supplier or consumer, has an incentive to deviate from the perfect equilibrium. for example, if i have the power to slash quantity and raise prices, i might do so. you can see such an illustration [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/monopoly-surpluses.svg/326px-monopoly-surpluses.svg.png), where the allocatively efficient point is where blue crosses red. if i do so, i lose the revenue from the bottom yellow triangle, and gain the upper blue square, a net gain for me. the top yellow triangle represents the consumers who were cut out by the price raise; so yellow = total loss. if i were to force the firm to produce at qc on the x-axis, they are forced to sacrifice the top blue square and gain the bottom yellow triangle, but consumers gain the top blue square and the top yellow* triangle, erasing all allocative inefficiency - but at cost to the firm! the price mechanism has generated a pareto efficient point, but we show that allocative improvements can still be made.---the truth, of course, is that transport economics is much more complex than that. but the rule that pricing may be flawed in flawed markets holds. that is not to say that the taxi market is inefficient, simply that there exists a strong potential for it to be. to fix the above, for example, the firm may charge different prices to different people (price discrimination). such is the case for area-based pricing, or student pricing, for example. in this case, the inefficiency is alleviated because everyone gets to use the service, but the benefits are skewed towards the producer/taxi firm.  then it becomes not a problem of efficiency, but of \"fairness\", which is much more subjective.even now, though, you might be able to think of a number of examples of abusing things like student price (reselling, scalping, buying more than you need...), which can re-introduce inefficiency."

(after the ride i realised i would've been able to but in all the hullabaloo, i was stressed!) so now, my eyes were darting around his car and i was thinking if i could possibly make the timing for my lesson and get a pair of pants! the memorable part comes now, as the driver looks at me, tells me to look behind the head rest and says that i can take his pair of pants for the lesson. he ensured it was clean and all because he uses it for prayers. my initial reaction was \"how am i supposed to give this back to you??\" to which he responded with a \"it's alright\" as if to say my predicament was more important at this moment. so i assuredly took the pants, wore it over my shorts while in his car, and when for my lesson.i didn't have this guy's name, number, car plate number or any type of identification at all! i've never seen nor heard from this driver again but i really hope that there are others like him out there, who would help their passengers out in the spur of the moment, even though they know they'll probably not get any recognition for it. if somewhere, somehow you are reading this though my cab driver, thank you very much for your spontaneity on the day and please do know that you can go for driving lessons in shorts! haha"

                "comment": "most of my grab rides involve a lot of idle chatter but one conversation left an indelible impression. this took place some time ago, back when uber was still around. i booked a ride to hougang around 7ish one morning and a lady driver accepted my booking.since it was the weekend, i was curious why she\u2019s already up and about so early, so i asked her. turns out she\u2019s a single mom and she drives an average of 12 to 15 hours a day (with little breaks in between) so she can make enough to raise her son. her mother cares for her boy when she\u2019s working, hence i am assuming she needs to cover her mother\u2019s expenses too. that\u2019s a huge responsibility to shoulder for one person.i told her that what she\u2019s doing is truly commendable, but she needs to take care of her health too. driving such long hours on the road is no joke. besides, fatigue can lead to accidents too. i also learnt that she tends to skip meals when she receives back-to-back bookings on a stretch.before i alighted, i told her that she might be able to make a small fortune if she persists at this rate, but the long-term health risks are hardly worth it. she should also spend more time with her kid before his childhood is forever lost in time.experiences like these remind me that every single driver has a story to tell, good or bad. some drive to pass time, some do it to get by, some do it to raise a family."

(remember, if you don't hold transferable, convertible title, you hold a lease.)i don't mind paying for what i get, but there's a word for those who ensure that people rarely if ever get what they think they're paying for, and a far less complimentary word for those who coerce their marks into believing that such ponzi schemes actually benefit them."

                "comment": "want to get back home at the end of the day in a levitating hovercraft?flying vehicles may just be a part of singapore's transport network in the near future; in fact, the ministry of transport says that you can \"bet your money\" on it.it has already taken initial steps to make it happen. the ministry's top official has told the business times that it is in talks with some companies to start trials on drones that can carry passengers.but human-carrying drones are not the only newfangled modes of transport to come to singapore down the road - on-demand buses that ply dynamic routes may soon feature in singapore's public bus network as well.these ideas were unveiled on wednesday at the second business times leaders' forum, where the ministry gave an idea of its vision for urban mobility in 2030 singapore.speaking to more than 400 participants, permanent secretary pang kin keong listed some of the trends and technologies his ministry is looking at for singapore's future transportation mix.noting that the availability and affordability of data and the rise of artificial intelligence are already upending the transport sector globally, mr pang stressed, however, that singapore's transport industry is up against land and manpower constraints.these constraints and trends will result in a different transport landscape for singapore by 2030, although trains will still continue to be the core of singapore's public transport system, he said.by 2030, there will be a rich and growing range of urban-mobility means.thus, rather than owning a mode of transport, it may be more sensible to pay for different mobility services tailored for different kinds of journeys. mr pang said that it may thus be possible to ride in a driverless pod to work, cycle to the gym after work, and then take an aerial taxi home.\"there is going to be a significant shift in the public mindset from one of ownership of transport assets - which is the mindset today - to one of procurement of transport services as and when you need them.\"the convergence of land and air mobility can be a mobility option, he added, as he showcased images of three human-carrying drones that have already been prototyped.they are the hoversurf scorpion by a russian startup, the volocopter vc200 from german company e-volo, and the ehang 184 autonomous aerial vehicle from china. dubai is already planning to fly the ehang 184 as an aerial taxi as early as july.\"in 2030, you bet your money that aerial transport will also be a means of urban mobility,\" he said, but did not disclose further details beyond the ministry being in talks with some companies about putting human-carrying drones through tests.while the contours of aerial transport in singapore's network may still be hazy for now, a new form of service may take shape sooner.mr pang said in his presentation that singapore is looking at on-demand public bus services for areas with, and during hours of low ridership. this means that buses will ply low-ridership routes that are dynamic and responsive to riders' real-time demand during off-peak hours.this can eliminate the problem of empty spaces on buses, which is a \"terrible waste\" of taxpayers' and commuters' money, he said.mr pang told bt that the ministry is still developing the concept, \"but probably will share something later this year\".the transport ministry is also stepping up its efforts to push for driverless buses. it has signed a partnership agreement with a party to build and put such buses through a trial, and will be signing another agreement quite soon, he said."

                "comment": "the root cause of this latest issue has more to do with the perceived \"injustice\" of the cena / foreign talent policy than a mere outburst from a self entitled elite against someone with less status and standing in society. if the video showed a local chinese bossman scolding the local chinese security guard , i believe there would still be some level of uproar but not to this level.the crux of the matter is many people have dreams of being director or gm or what not at some large mnc and increasingly we see that these jobs are disproportionately held by foreigners. what makes it worse is they are held by foreigners from countries that we previously looked down on - its not so much the race we looked down on, we looked down on those countries as being inferior. yet today we have to kowtow to these people at work.hence it strikes a nerve. just go look at the jp morgan fb page. thousands of singaporeans are out for this guy's bloodto be honest, i can understand why he got upset. he probably thought that the guard is selective in the application of the $10 rule. he probably thought that during cny, this would not happen. he might be rightbut perception is reality"

                "comment": "> # ex-taxi driver admits to causing nus student's death at clementi road junction> singapore \u2014 a taxi driver on wednesday (17 july) admitted to causing the death of a 19-year-old national university of singapore female undergraduate whom he was ferrying following an accident in clementi road.> yap kok hua, 55, pleaded guilty to one count each of negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide and a negligent act causing grievous injury for the accident on 19 april last year. one count of causing injury through a negligent act and one of failing to ensure his passengers wore seatbelts were taken into consideration for his sentencing.> just prior to the accident, yap was about to turn at a junction at commonwealth avenue west and clementi road. he had attempted to make a right turn into clementi road despite seeing a car coming at a high speed towards him in the opposite direction.> nus undergraduate kathy ong kai ting was seated at the rear left of yap's taxi along with two other men, ting jun heng, who was beside her, and lim jin jie, who was at the rear right of the taxi.> another man, zon lim thou jung, was seated at the front passenger seat of the taxi. the three men were 22 years old.> the group was heading back to a nus residential college, tembusu college, when they were involved in the accident.> video footage of the accident last year made its rounds online.> the court heard that on the night of 19 april last year, yap picked up the four passengers from clementi mall. yap did not ensure that his rear passengers were wearing their seat-belts before moving off.> yap then drove along commonwealth avenue west towards commonwealth avenue on the rightmost lane. upon reaching the signalised cross junction of commonwealth avenue west by clementi road, yap stopped at the red traffic light. when the traffic light signal turned green, but before the green right turn arrow lit up, yap drove into the right turn pocket.> he stopped and checked for vehicles coming from the opposite direction. even though he saw a car coming towards him from the opposite direction at a high speed, he decided to do a right turn.> the 21-year-old car driver, ng li ning, who had the right of way, was unable to avoid the taxi and the two vehicles collided. a health sciences authority report later found that ng was travelling at a speed of 92 kmh to 97 kmh on a road with a speed limit of 70kmh. the same report also found that had ng's car been travelling within the speed limit, a collision would likely have been avoidable.> both cars spun and were severely damaged, said deputy public prosecutor timotheus koh. the taxi also hit another car which was stationary at the signalised junction.> all the passengers were conveyed to national university hospital where ong was pronounced dead at 10.25pm.> zon lim suffered from multiple facial lacerations, bruises and glass in his wounds.> lim jin jie received bruises and a fracture to his spine.> ting had a traumatic brain injury, and became vegetative initially but his condition has since improved. he suffered multiple injuries to his ribs, lung, left kidney and pelvic bone, and was dependent on a ventilator. he is still undergoing rehabilitation.> dpp koh sought eight weeks' jail for yap and a disqualification from driving for five years.> the accident claimed ong\u2019s life and inflicted serious lasting injuries to three others, said the prosecutor. the accused was \u201caware of the danger approaching but decided to run the risk anyway\u201d, he added.> yap was fined for several traffic offences up to 2016, including failing to conform to red light signal on three occasions, careless driving and speeding, according to the prosecutor.> josephus tan, yap\u2019s lawyer, asked for six weeks' jail but agreed with the prosecution on the disqualification period.> the lawyer from invictus law pointed out that tan had first checked for oncoming traffic.> \"this is in stark contrast to the typical dangerous driving or even careless driving cases whereby the offender simply proceeds to drive through the junction without a single stop whatsoever,\" said tan.> referring to the hsa report, tan pointed out that the accident might have been avoidable if ng had been travelling within the speed limit.> yahoo news singapore understands that action will be taken against ng.> for a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, yap could be jailed up to two years, fined or both. for causing grievous hurt through a negligent act he faces jail of up to two years, or a maximum $5,000 fine, or both.> related stories:> ex-taxi driver accused of causing 19-year-old nus student's death at clementi road junction> taxi

(the taxi share system for the) whole (of) singapore is down, same as their trains,\u201d he told today, adding that the smrt has promised a refund of his s$68 10-hour rental. > \u201cit has happened to me twice so far (in seven months).\u201d> smrt\u2019s taxi share scheme allows those with a taxi driving vocational license to rent taxis in three-hourly blocks by picking up and returning the taxi at a location that is convenient to them. > so far, smrt is the only taxi operator adopting such a model where taxi drivers do not have to seek a relief driver to cover the cost of a rented vehicle should they not wish to commit full-time. > hourly rental varies across the day between s$6.80 and s$s$12.80.  > [source](http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/part-time-smrt-cabbies-locked-out-taxis-server-glitch)---v2.0 | [github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [readme/changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/readme.md)"
