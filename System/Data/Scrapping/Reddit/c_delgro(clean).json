(remember, if you don't hold transferable, convertible title, you hold a lease.)i don't mind paying for what i get, but there's a word for those who ensure that people rarely if ever get what they think they're paying for, and a far less complimentary word for those who coerce their marks into believing that such ponzi schemes actually benefit them."

(usually people will disclose upfront but some don\u2019t)hopefully also you want to see the following (esp for older bikes)-\thow the engine is from a cold start (you might have to tell the owner don\u2019t warm up before you reach)-\ttry out the signalling and all-\tcheck out if the chain is clean or not (more of a thing i look out personally, some people don\u2019t clean their chain and it gives me the impression that they don\u2019t care for their bikes)-\tcheck out the paintwork (has it discoloured? is it still shiny? might come from petrol being spilled during refilling esp near the tank or from parking in the open instead of in the shelter)list is not exhaustive, anyone else can add to this! cheers and ride safe! get gear if you can and try to wear it frequently, quite a lot of people buy then sell shortly after because they realise it\u2019s too warm for their liking"
