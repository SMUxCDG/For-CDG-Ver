                "comment": "I think many companies who want to demand people to return to office, who have been just fine wfh, tend to be ones with more backward thinking. It benefits the company to have more people wfh since they can cut costs on rental and furniture/equipment/electricity/pantry provisions. What prevails for these kinds of companies is the mentality of \"if I cannot see you, you are not working.\" I find a lot of sg companies still pushing for wio and I surmise it's due to this inaccurate mentality (plus govt encouraging it as if more warm bodies in office means covid situation is better). So they'd keep their high rentals etc just to make sure they see ur physical body at the office even if your productivity is actually the same (in fact sometimes it's lower in office cos u chit chat but at home there's no random encounters to start convo). Not to mention employees have more rest time cos don't need to commute or spend time dressing up. More rest = better general performance which potentially = better productivity and company reaps these rewards. This is assuming no screaming kids or stressful home life la. Also personally my toilet breaks are much faster at home cos I don't have to traverse a whole office building floor to get to it lol.\n\nMy company wanted to push for more wio but over time I think they realised 50/50 is doable and 100% is not necessary. In meetings I dropped subtle (I think) comments hinting at better productivity or efficiency from wfh arrangements lol. In the end they chose to lower their rental costs so at most we will be 50/50. Honestly 90% of us don't need to wio 99% of the time."

So we haven't been made to come back on the 2 days a week, but instead have been left to our own best judgement as to when is it necessary,/advantageous to come back, e.g. on days we have team meetings or workshops/brainstorm sessions which are typically more productive and effective when held face to face."

I have done a few and gotten paid a nice bounty (free MacBook!). However for security as a career I find it really boring, as you are basically creating checklist after checklist and arguing with angry developers who think you add no real value. Essentially a sandwich role in the enterprise. Also the tech moves so fast that it\u2019s just a constant race to add new certifications.\n\nAs for software dev, the focus would be on crypto. Writing smart contracts and Web 3.0. Those crypto companies are very well funded and they like singapore for its light handed approach to crypto compared to the crackdown going on everywhere."

Then you will only need a handful of data scientists. \n\nSoft dev is nice too with more apps. But will only get more competitive with India, Vietnam, China coders. Frankly its just becoming a grindy white collar job. So unless you specialise in something, i dont see how soft dev will be that hot anymore. So to the pt: IOT. Iot is a big thing that will become bigger. Smart watch, smart fridge, smart cars whatever. As long as it is not just about the basic web, IOT stuff will probably be a big thing in the near future.\n\nSecurity is also lacking because alot of ppl view security as this topic learnt exclusively by these nerd guys (which frankly isnt wrong. I only see nerd guys learning it), but it will be bigger. Todays talk about privacy will create a bigger market for both side of the fence. The state hackers (e.g. China, Russia) who are more than keen to decrypt other people and the corporates who are more than keen to encrypt their stuff. The more you encrypt, the more you need to decrypt. Its a cat and mouse game. \n\nThere might be a new field coming up, but not quite sure what thatll be. Just a gut feel."

From JS front end via devops infra to service backend to hardware-specific stuff. This will always be in demand but different areas will be more and less popular over time. You need to move with the needs. \n\nData science is primarily science. You need to be able to form hypotheses and validate them. This requires some level of domain knowledge. If that suites you, it is in high demand, it\u2019ll stay in high demand, and picking up the core tech skills is easier than SE. You\u2019ll need some more math tho. \n\nSecurity is the field that I\u2019m least familiar with but from the CVs that I see going into this it\u2019s split into engineers (much like standard SEs who just happen to work on security) and operators (who just use the tools the SEs create to ward off attacks). The group of proper security designers - people who discover attack vectors and design defenses against it - is tiny (less than 5% of the people working in the field). \n\nYou won\u2019t be out of a job in any of these but you need to carefully Evaluate your aptitude against them.

Because you do not want to take on the credit line and have it appear on your credit file. As this will increase your debt servicing ratio (i.e. TDSR) and you will not be able to take out a sizeable mortgage for a house, etc. in the future. Plus if the loan is not under your name and repayment depending on you paying them back, generally people will treat you slightly nicer. Make up any story NOT to take out the loan and have them take it out, and let them shoulder the monthly repayment, etc. If they are financially irresponsible, the house or car will be repossessed, so no harm done to your credit line and everyone learnt a lesson, it's particularly crucial in your case as they have assets and you don't so don't take on debt, get your financial plans in order.\n\n2) As you have already done so, NEVER disclose salary info to anyone, generally only two set of people other than yourself should know your pay: the first is HR + your boss + bank loan officer (+ maybe your financial planner), the other is your S.O. (wife / husband / fiance / fiancee)."

Correct me if I'm wrong, from what I understand, normally police officers need a warrant to investigate your possessions. If they don't have have a warrant, you should be able to reject. If the officers are acting outside of their authority(I hope not), you might not be the first victim and might not be the last. If its nothing, at least you have some clarification and hopefully some closure."

But at this point, it would likely be taken as you gave it willingly. \n\nI'm not local but cops back in Canada learn how to twist the law to aid them in investigation. They won't take the phone from you, they'll convince you to hand it over freely. \n\nI had a massive party at my place when I was young . A friend answered the door, it was the cops.  They asked for me while waiting outside. When I got to the door they confirmed it was my place then told me I had to go with them. I figure I did nothing wrong so I listened. After I got a few feet from my door they changed their mind and told me to go back inside. At the time I thought it was weird that I could literally feel him stepping on my heels as I walked in. Learned later that cops can't enter private property without a warrant or permission from a resident. Following me in is considered permission. So getting me to step out was tricking me to let them follow me back in. \n\nRemember this was Canada not Singapore. But learning local rules is a great way to protect yourself in legal situations. Secondly. In Canada you can film the interaction. Once filming ask them to tell you if you are being asked to hand over the phone or forced by law.  Give me your phone is still a request. Language is everything in law \n\nI'm surprised to see this kind of action randomly in Singapore. Cops seem so chill here. But I also think sometimes it's easier to comply.  Always good to get a police officers badge number in a situation like this. If you think you are profiled by the way you look, dress, race, you might want to start reading more of your rights. \n\nI use to get stopped a lot when I was young. Shaggy hair, baggy clothes. I started dressing up when I went to the airport and I stopped getting \"randomly searched\"."

                "comment": "Actually, for precision, you generally do have the right to silence and the privilege against self incrimination in Singapore. The right to silence and privilege against self incrimination is captured in Section 22(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010?ProvIds=P1IV-#pr22-). See also: Sections 231(m) CPC and S291 CPC for other stages of the criminal procedure. The right of silence, however, does not apply in corruption charges. \n\nOf course, in certain situations, choosing to exercise your right to silence could result in the courts drawing an adverse inference (if you are eventually charged for a crime and brought before the courts). See Section 261 CPC (https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010?ProvIds=P1XIV-#pr261-). This is because when questioned and accused of a crime, if you are innocent, you are generally expected to say something in your defence. That said, the courts are unlikely to convict someone based purely on an adverse inference. The prosecution has to prove your supposed guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - a high standard that sole reliance on an adverse inference is unlikely to meet. The right of silence (and possible adverse inference drawn) is also well established in case law but reference to statute for my explanation here should be sufficient. \n\nOf course, when in doubt, please contact your lawyer, who will be better placed to advise you. On that note, as a point of interest, according to s9(3) of the Singapore Constitution, you do have the constitutional right to be defended by a lawyer. https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P1IV-#pr9-"

                "comment": "I agree the lack of students is one thing. One contributive factor is the proportion of Singapore which doesn\u2019t speak Tamil. Given that   the population of Indians make up a small proportion of Singapore\u2019s population and that most who speak Tamil are Indians (I emphasise most, not all. Likewise, not all Indians speak Tamil. ), that\u2019s one reason why there\u2019s a small student size taking Tamil. Moreover, there\u2019s NTILs offered in Sg. Though lower in demand compared to Tamil, this eats off the pool of students that take Tamil. Overall, the student size taking Tamil is low, hence demand for Tamil teachers compared to other languages like Chinese is lower. Hope it gives more insight into the answer you were looking for\n\nPlus, my speculation is that since the demand is rather isolated, it is a better delegation of manpower to allocate schools where Tamil demands are the highest and not allocate Tamil teachers in all schools or where the demand for the language is very very minuscule (aka 1/2 students school-wide). my guess on the rationale on why some schools don't have teachers. \n\nLastly, we do have to acknowledge some schools like Madrassas or SAPs where students are required to learn 1 MT specifically, hence Tamil teachers in such schools will not make sense. \n\ni hope that answers your question. \n\n(Sorry if I offended any readers, the offence cause is unintentional)"

It is also common for them to move from city to city for their career. During this phase of their life, it does not make sense for them to buy a house because things like agent fees and mortgages are expensive when you have a short credit history and a low salary. There is also no point buying a big empty place for you to live on your own. A small 1-bedroom, studio apartment or bedsit is enough and affordable to most young people. \n\nWhen they get married and settle down in a particular city to start a family, they usually are secure in their carreer and earning more. They then take up a mortgage to buy a place that is big enough for their family's needs. During this phase of their life, it is very difficult to make them move because of their family commitments. By 65, most married people in the US are house owners unless they are divorced or have had financial trouble (e.g. getting laid off). \n\nIn Singapore, most young people just live with their parents until they get married and buy a flat (resale or BTO) because there is just no affordable apartment rental market. A large part  of your money is locked up in CPF and you cannot use it to rent a place."

                "comment": "Housing prices have gone up sharply because there is a temporary savings glut as people are spending less on other things such as holidays and eating out. There is also a greater demand for living space because of WFH arrangements in Singapore. In addition, the rental market is saturated by demand from Malaysian workers who are stranded in Singapore and cannot go back to Malaysia. The housing supply is also disrupted by the restrictions on construction workers coming into Singapore. The cost of construction materials has also gone up.\n\nAll these things will probably pass in two years' time when the pandemic is over and the housing prices will probably go down as demand and supply factors return to normal. In the mean time, do consider renting as an option in the meantime.\n\nThe resale flat market is likely to soften in the medium term because we have large cohorts in the Silver generation who will pass away and release their flats into the resale market. This will increase the supply of resale units and drive down prices."

However it's entirely true that we may see couples rent as a stepping stone, but for those that can stay at home that's an obvious preferred alternative (assumption being that of a SC couple staying with one side is viable). For this group, accruing two individuals' CPF from the start of working life means buying is both viable and preferred to using nett salary for cash.\n\nThere is however a big portion of the SPR population who are on blue collar/low-end white-collar work that face more difficulties in saving up and accessing HDB so they end up renting for longer periods already. Not really sure what the long game looks like for this group TBH."

Homeownership rates are currently high in Singapore., but this hasn\u2019t always been the case. Families have historically needed to either build their own homes or rent a home from someone else. Although it may not be ideal, renting does have its advantages, too. For some people renting might make more sense for their financial circumstances.\n\nSearching for a new home can be overwhelming. Figuring out how much you can reasonably spend on rent, choosing a location, and finding roommates all take time and energy. Coliving has become a popular [alternative](https://adobha.com) to traditional housing options for renters looking to save money and build community."

Their pay are justified because of their experience from their competitors, proactive leadership qualities, quality of knowledge or specialised knowledge. Which makes them highly sorted after. They usually end up in middle upper management. \n\nThe third and last group are what I called \"What is their experience again?\", if you check their LinkedIn page, they started from the upper middle then to the top. When talking to them, you do not feel they value add anything to company, but a seat warmer. They are chosen by the parent company, or close to the board of directors."

You pay less, the potential employee goes somewhere else.\n\nCan the supply be increased easily? E.g. if you can hire anyone off the street, not much training required, and they can do a good enough job, supply will be high, and pay will be relatively low. If supply is constrained because some special hard to obtain skill or talent is necessary to do a good job, pay will be higher. E.g. software engineer, good salespeople.\n\nLow pay: simple job, anybody can do it with minimal training. If one guy quits, you can easily find a replacement with minimal disruption.\n\nMedium pay: could be someone in a low paying field who is reliable and rised through the ranks to become a supervisor. Or in a low paying field, but gained a lot of experience over time. Or someone starting out at a technical field where some qualifications are necessary, and it's not so easy to just replace this individual. \n\nHigh pay: very specialised skills which are low in supply.  People in leadership positions who manage large organisations who are not easily replacable, and if they screw up or fail to organise things well, many things will cock up. Also salespeople who are very good at what they do.\n\nAstronomical pay: people who are responsible for the company making lots of money. If the company isn't heading in the right direction, consistently fails to deliver profits, you fire this person."

Yes, as more and more company is moving towards cloud/outsourcing their server to third party. However this role is very niche as you recognized.\n\nThere will always be prospect for this role. And your career progress, you will have better understanding of maintaining environment. This will lead a transition to being a DevOps which is another niche market.\n\nBoth of the roles are highly demand because of the scarce in engineers. So OP if you are not lazy, and continuously improved yourself. You will have the best pie that has little competition. So don't think yourself as just data center engineer and your job is maintaining hardware. Also DevOps is just another option, there is also transition to System engineer and Database Administrator and etc. Don't let yourself be limited.\n\nAlso this may not happen yet but you will need to understand the architecture and solutioning of the companies. So when it's transit into cloud, your expertise will still be required. People think moving server to cloud is the end of story. But it's just the beginning. You will still need to maintain it cause only you understand how the architecture work and translate from on-prem to cloud.\n\nSo essentially like any career, git gud and you will constantly in demand. If you neglect or contemplate or lazy, then you will just be forever a hardware maintenance guy which is very fast in being obsolete. IT evolve very fast. Like very super duper the fast."

There is no job is less or more weight. See everything as same. What we see as today is less weight will be the very basic stepping stone for you after 10 years.\n\nWhen cloud grow from now in 10 years, if we do not know the DC architecture we can't negotiate something at that stage at very granular level.\n\nSo my 2 cents is grab the opportunity and learn. Ofcourse, late night shifts are common in this role and travel to various countries where our company maintain their DC is possible. If someone like tourism rather than travel this role may be off topic."

Look up professors/ researchers who are doing the same topics/ research as you, and ask them. Also, be open to other uni like NUS or NTU. There are unis like SUTD, SIM etc that you could consider to increase your chance. Most important is to network and reach out to these people."

However, do consider other universities like SUSS, JCU, UOL where the criteria is less restrictive.\n\nIf you don't restrict yourself to universities, you can join think tanks, Banks and NGOs where there are a lot of demand for PhD grad.\n\nLong term job prospect is pretty easy, our unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the world and there are demands for highly skilled people."

The caveat is that the foreigner should be from a STEM background. We have a lot of foreigners in the tech and engineering fields.\n\nYou have to understand that even for locals, those of economics background do not have an easy time finding jobs. The top bachelor's students in economics might go on to management consulting and investment banking, and maybe as economists with the government. But the majority of them go on to generic corporate roles in the private sector. There's just very little demand for this skillset in Singapore. \n\nSo as a foreigner with only a PhD and no work experience, it's very hard to find work in the industry. Your best chance is to actually gain work experience in your home country first."

If she seek help from social worker, she can also voice out the school fees matter, ask for opinions from them how to seek help or appeal for financial aid for her poly school fees."

I would strongly urge your girlfrienf to consult a financial assistant officer from her poly to check out diff avenues and maybe also ask help avenues like Family Support Centres (SFC) from Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), they help with vulnerable individuals, including estrangement i think.

I think all other suggestions are good but it will require a lot of commitment from yourself and other people. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know how to reach MSF, you can bring her to the nearest Family Service Centre, and the Social workers there will assess the situation and involve MSF if needed. This is especially important because not only is the mother causing you and your girlfriend distress, she seem to also be a factor in her brother\u2019s depression which is a safety issue that needs to be considered. \n\nThe following processes might not be palatable, but it might be better than the current situation ultimately. You can find out more with the FSC first before you officially bring your girlfriend for a proper intake. \n\nOf course if you want to try to help her in your own way there is no harm, but just suggesting an \u201cofficial channel\u201d if necessary. \n\nHope this helps."

Because to be frank, often we heard children from toxic family issues always turn out to be Ah Beng or go off the right road very often or worse end up in boy's home. \n\nAnd since you mention he's going to study for his O level, I seriously think your girlfriend and her brother should go seek help from family service centre and see if staying at youth shelter is available option for him. The action her mother is projecting is child abuse already so I'm sure family service centre will have some solution options for your girlfriend and her brother. And once if you seek help from family service centre or maybe MSF, maybe financial aid will be an available option as well.. Don't give up hope!\n\nActually if her parents really do want to chip in money for her education, then that's fine though it's gonna be tough for both of you. Cause in that way, in future if your girlfriend is serious about cutting ties with her mum,she won't have leverage on your girlfriend about her spending money on her school fees and blah blah...  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd remember to give yourself a pat on your shoulder.

If we report the situation to MSF, are there ways to keep the interaction confidential or does it have to be transparent? How do we ensure that it doesn't become a case of he said she said when the situation worsens? We don't want to make moves without knowing what her mom will do in retaliation and we're hoping that arrangements could be made in secret until we're completely protected - legally and emotionally so that both my girlfriend and her brother can withstand the shock of \"losing\" their own mother.

If you don\u2019t want an official \u201cinvestigation\u201d I suggest you try walking in to the FSC, explain the problem including them not doing an intake so that you can understand what will happen next before deciding if you want to commit to this problem with an \u201cofficial\u201d protocol. \n\nYou can try having documentation such as audio recordings, bank statements or what not. It may devolve into a \u201che say she say\u201d situation, but usually if there are more people on your side of the story MSF will really take a closer look. Especially if they receive a referral from the FSC. Furthermore I think if school fees are not paid, and the father has proof of a transaction history sent to the mother, that might be another piece of evidence that supports your girlfriend\u2019s story. \n\nUsually once MSF gets involved, you\u2019re protected by the law or some form of enforcing body. It will not be wise for the mother to try and go against it. As per my understanding they will usually make an arrangement with a safe adult, perhaps the father, to care for the children. There will be visitation restrictions imposed on the mother as well. I am not sure what happens if her father is not keen to be involved. Maybe they will turn to the grandparents or other adults. I believe in such scenarios they might make other arrangements. \n\nIn sum I suggest both of you to go find out more, then pick the lesser evil. It sucks that this is what your girlfriend is facing, and this isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s fault on any of you. It\u2019s just an unfortunate situation especially growing up. \n\nIf in the end nothing changes because your girlfriend picks status quo to be the more palatable option that\u2019s her choice as well. Change is difficult. I would then suggest drawing up a plan on how to move on from the mother in the future. I see that you\u2019ve already started looking into the Maintenance Act; not sure if FSC can advise you about it but give it a go. Maybe Legal Aid is able to provide clearer answers as well. \n\nI am not sure how to help your girlfriend and her brother accept the possibility that they might lose their mother. They might need time, and they actually might need to talk about this as well. Even though the brother can see the biased behaviour, he is still in a favourable position if things remain status quo and might not approve or support of this decision. \n\nLastly I would like to point out that it is not MSF\u2019s goal to simply remove the mother from the situation. Their goal is to encourage or \u201ccoach\u201d a healthier relationship and eventually reintegrating everybody back into one cohesive unit again using whatever means necessary. Although I believe it is still your girlfriend\u2019s choice on whether she wants that in her future. \n\nI hope this helps, and do take care of yourselves."

                "comment": "Hi guys.It's heartwarming knowing that so many people took the time to read through my entire post and even left advises and the much needed opinions in the comments. I can't reply to everyone but I can guarantee you I have read every single comment/reply thoroughly. This is a throwaway account, so I apologise in advance if I do not reply any PMs.I think I got my answer which is that I'm not totally faultless, but I'm 90% right. I decided that cutting contact totally is not the solution, thus I will reduce contact to minimal. That said, I'll be planning my finances and start kicking off my \"moving out\" plan.I noticed some common advises among the comments and would like to summarise them with my replies here:\n\n**1.** **Shift out but still give allowance. Close my bank account so she can\u2019t take my money anymore.**\n\n* Agree on shifting out and giving allowance. But I will not close my bank account. I plan to create another account that holds all my income and then transfer her allowance into my current bank account that she has access to. At least I have more control over my finances this way without having to make her feel I am giving her an \u201callowance\u201d. Based on her pride, she would be pissed if I closed my current account and just transfer a fixed amount directly into her account regularly.\n\n**2. Staying under the same roof as her is subconsciously taking a toll on my mental health. Things would not improve for me unless I move out.**\n\n* Thanks for pointing it out to me. Sometimes we get so lost in the situation we don\u2019t realise what is actually going on.\n\n**3. Get maintenance from my dad.**\n\n* My dad basically abandoned me and went to live his life with another family before I even started kindergarten. If my mum did little for me, I dare say he did even less. There is a court order for him to pay maintenance which he has flouted for years. I would not want to take single cent from an irresponsible father like that.\n\n**4. Track all my expenses to protect myself should my mum invoke her right to Parental Maintenance Act**\n\n* Knowing my mum, she has too much pride to do that. I can guarantee she would not do it. Even so, I still plan on giving her an allowance when I get a better salary.\n\n**5.\u00a0Take the house**\n\n* The house is solely under her name. Even if my name was in it, I do not want it simply because I do not want anything that has to do with her. I\u2019ll just accept the $40K as rental for staying for 20+ years. Just because I have fallen out with her doesn\u2019t mean I want to see her suffer without a home for old age.\n\n**6. My mum could be suffering from depression herself. Try counselling.**\n\n* I am very sure this will not work as she does not like counselling. In addition, she will think I\u2019m just trying to brainwash her into thinking she is crazy and that she is wrong for treating me this way. This will only strain the relationship further. There isn\u2019t anyone else to suggest it to her because she doesn\u2019t have friends (since she hasn\u2019t been working) and we are not in contact with any relatives.\n\n**7.\u00a0Talk it out with her. Tell her how I feel about the way things are.**\n\n* I agree with this but not to my situation. I believe etting each other know how they truly feel is one of the keys to a healthy relationship. I did share with my mum how I felt before. However, she always tells me I\u2019m expecting too much and that I should be grateful I have food, cloths and a roof over my head. It only made me feel worse because I started to wonder if I\u2019m actually too self-entitled. It\u2019s true that there are starving children in other parts of the world. It\u2019s true that a family in Hong Kong probably has to squeeze into an apartment the size of my room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, thank you everyone for your words of encouragement and advises. If I did not tag you, it could be that you left comment after I started typing this. However, I will still be coming back to read any new comments, so please leave your opinions for me if you have any.\n\nu/britishlandrace, u/redditersg, u/rae90, u/cloudpillow, u/La_petite_moi, u/Yannaing1984,u/ineednoBELL, u/juzcuychai, u/Aquilae7,u/tropicallyme, u/pushthepushpop, u/Eastern_Department_8,u/wistingaway, u/mechie_mech_mechface,u/chypher888, u/redsoupbase, u/LostChances44,u/cloverhoney12, u/Fearless-Cookie, u/ebadf,u/luffytheOGgaan. u/paperboiko, u/CRT_Enthusiast, u/hornyolebustard, u/Farfaraway94, u/GramTooNoob, u/yinyangpeng, u/nerdinator1, u/Nevvie,u/effluoxanax, u/kiahora, u/random_xx21,u/peachiekien, u/heunraveler1985, u/SGSweatZ, u/MrHonwe, u/financial_learner123,u/sunnymuffin123, u/zksnapz, \u00a0u/ForzaJY, u/highSESCaipng, u/sassygal0594, u/stolmen, u/givilamer2, u/schzimmydeenie, u/JanJMK, u/rosecrepes,u/thisis4investing, u/WittyKap0, u/hippodeige"

She hardly cooked and whenever she did never did the dishes. They would pile for weeks in the sink. Just absolutely filthy. Never cleaned the house it was just a pig\u2019s sty. My grandmother left me money for my college fees, I got a scholarship so that just went towards paying the house loan too. She sat at home ALL DAY watching TV. When I was super stressed out in Uni I asked her to help me do my laundry because I had an attire I needed to wear for a presentation that week, she said she\u2019ll do next two weeks. Who needs two weeks to do laundry? It\u2019s literally throwing it in the washing machine and just helping me to hang and dry. She did NOTHING at home. The house was constantly filthy, I would clean the toilet, wash the kitchen and dishes, two months later nobody would have maintained it. Used me and manipulated me a lot against my dad to pity her but would never get a divorce. Emotional blackmailing me etc she caused a tonne of damage to my mental health. I was close to my aunt and she once asked my aunt \u2018I don\u2019t know why she hates me so much\u2019. It was bewildering to me how do you not know? She used to force me to tag along with my dad to KTV lounges and report what I see. And I had to see random women grinding on my dad? Who the fuck subjects a nine year old to that? When my dad found out I told on him he slapped me. \n\nAmidst a tonne of other issues at home, constant drama between my parents, I eventually felt like if I don\u2019t leave I wasn\u2019t going to survive. When I did she simply said \u201cI gave birth to you and I raised you\u201d and said some horrible things. I don\u2019t even know what she\u2019s talking about I was raised financially by my uncles and aunt my parents hardly ever worked. I remember thinking in primary school when I heard my friends\u2019 parents went to work, I couldn\u2019t even fathom it, in my head I was wondering what is that even like? Their parents work and cook and clean like normal people. \n\nSorry long rant. Sometimes parents aren\u2019t parents just because they gave birth to you. Why have children if you\u2019re not going to be responsible? My elder cousin told me \u2018you know sometimes two people come together and just happen to have a baby, it doesn\u2019t mean they knew how to be parents.\u2019 If it\u2019s what you need then just leave, my mental health only gradually improved after I left. Otherwise I was sinking and sinking and I felt like I eventually would have ended up in a psych ward. Other people can say whatever they want, but if they\u2019ve never lived your experience they\u2019ll never understand it. Ultimately you\u2019ll have to do what you need for yourself.\n\nEdit: Also if you move out, you can just tell your mum to rent out the other two rooms easily at least $500 each a month, depending on location. Plus some part time work she\u2019ll easily be able to support herself"

First, go close your bank account or inform them that you do not give consent for any withdrawal or transfer from your account by your mother to hers. If it is joint account, withdraw what is rightfully yours (if I am not wrong, you need her to close the joint account and she will not do it and make things worse for you). Open your own account and make sure she does not have any access to your money. You are not her parent and if you are moving out, do not inform her. Make sure your name is not in the deed of the house, whether as an occupant or 2nd owner. Decoupling your name from the flat would require her to pay you your share if you are the 2nd owner (of course she will put up a fight and claim she does not have the financial means to pay you) and check with hdb on how to remove your name as an occupant. If you do not remove your name, you will have difficulties in buying your own flat. Regardless that you do not want or have anything to do with her flat, collect all bank statements and proof of your income that went into the upkeep of the mortgage and bills. Record her verbal abuse pronto. Keep a detailed diary of what you have done with the upkeep of the flat - cooking, washing etc. There is a law that parents can sue their kids for financial support. I helped my exMIL with this. Cover your ass starting as of now. Here's wishing you all the strength to move onward with YOUR life and a better one at that."

Get a new phone number and whatever she may be able to use to track you down with or potentially use to gain access to your bank. share the number only with the people you want to keep in your life, and those you are confident won\u2019t spill to your mom/hate you for leaving. If you must, give her a monthly allowance that will let her live, but not enough for her to want to keep living the way she does right now.\n\nPlease make sure you hide your intentions of leaving well though because if she catches wind, she may try to take your money before you can transfer it to your new account and guilt you into staying. \n\nAnd a warning if you do, you may have to cut contacts with anyone you care about that she has close contacts with too.

In this case, I just think you should do what is enough e.g. giving your mum the house , and that she can use the money for her old age. If she decide in the end to spend all her money one shot, I think it's her choice - much like you choosing how you want your life to be. Taking care of others, does not mean sacrificing your sanity and life.. Doing a good thing, does not mean that it's the right thing to do.\n\nI hope this make sense. Take care."

For various reasons, my mom also regret giving birth to me and her personality took a turn for the worst as post maternal depression aren't really a thing in the Chinese culture back then. She basically just took her rage out on me. Then my Dad never really got himself back up after the financial crisis, and became addicted to gambling and debts. Years ago, he even got a major stroke that cost everything I worked for while he simply enjoys life now.\n\nI honestly thought of disowning him but many ppl guilt trip me. And I Iive with his siblings cause we got no house, so it's not practical to do so. Even when I survived my suicide, I was sorta guilt trip again for dumping it on them after my death. I swear there was no escape. As for my mom, I ran away from home when I was a kid and that's kinda how I ended up like this. Both my parents were basically failures.\n\nIf you already made up your mind and have a plan to execute, then just do it. Live for yourself, don't let the concept of blood ties trap you. You already paid back enough and done good to ensure she has a roof after you leave. Unlike popular belief in the past where kids are born to support the parents, it's really only valid if they actually did their role as a parent. So don't feel like you owe them anything. Even after disowning, she can still reach out to you if she misses you. It's not a restraining order after all, and it may be for her own good too"

So I think it\u2019s pretty clear what you need to do. \n\nBut, I think it\u2019s important to recognise that she probably is grateful of the support you\u2019ve given her over all these years. But is just entirely incapable of showing it. If you\u2019re all she has, I\u2019d suggest you don\u2019t cut her off completely, instead start making a life for yourself with the hope (importantly not with the expectation) that she can be a part of it one day. \n\nThere are a few people who have commented saying that she\u2019s a bad person (in much worse language). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way you need to be thinking about this. You need to treat the situation with compassion, try to leave on good terms (at least from your perspective). \n\nYou should write her a letter about why you\u2019re leaving. Because she probably won\u2019t react well in the moment, but it will help her come to terms with it eventually, and it helps you to get your point across in a logical and unemotional way. \n\nFrom a financial perspective, I\u2019m assuming that going it alone means you probably won\u2019t be able to support her financially in the future. You\u2019ve given it some thought by explaining her option to downgrade to a smaller place and have enough cash to live off. Make sure you explain that to her clearly and again, unemotionally. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with supporting her financially if you can afford to do so, but you should prioritise yourself if she has the ability to support herself. Don\u2019t, as others are suggesting, take the house. That\u2019s spiteful and not necessary. It sounds like you chose to pay off the loan, you have to take that on the chin. \n\nStarting over is incredibly scary, but also very refreshing, you\u2019ll find out some awesome stuff about yourself that you never knew. \n\nI wish you the best of luck. And remember, just because someone doesn\u2019t show you compassion, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to show it to them"

If yes, then I must thank you for being a nice person - in times of Covid-19 like this we need lots of compassion.\n2. If others is makig critical remarks (bosses or parents) of you - what will you do?   If something you can just listened and laugh it off - just continue doing it, and make yourself happy.   If you cannot endure, then leave the person.   I left my job several times because of this.\n3. But if you leave something close to your heart, and felt guilty of it - then think carefully again - is it within your endurance limit to forgive and forget?   Don't always think better things will come along - usually NOT.   Your future is always decided by your own mind, not external factor.   If yes, then welcome to a more compassionate society.\n4. Frankly I was trying to identify the root of your unhappiness:   your relationship with your mum may only be a superficial outcome arising from this root.   Still cannot identify that.   But if you can identify that root cause, then it should override all your unhappy relationship with everyone else (mum, or bosses, or friends....all of us have one or another source of unhappiness) and help you think straight.\n\nJust some general rules in life:  \na.  avoid knowing all rich people - they are usually more toxic and selfish and corrode your mental health with unhappiness. (from their replies to your here, you can see who are the selfish one and who are not).   Same goes for high paying jobs - everyone of your colleagues is likely to be in the same selfish league.   Last thing to do is to listen and talk to them.  \n\n\nb.   Go for a jog, walk in the park or anything to have a different experience.   Good to have a occasional quiet solitude time for oneself."

Help her wake up, and let her know that if she continues this treatment to you, she will lose a loving son that does his best to sustain the family. \n\nCutting contact is not wrong, but i dont think its fair to you or your mum to just end the family ties like that. Give her a chance to repent and make it up to you.

I felt horrible about it, but I had to leave.\n\nSo please know that it is ok to prioritise yourself first, to get yourself into a good place before you can look out for others. You can always go back to help her once you\u2019ve helped yourself \u2014 from you writing this alone it shows you value this last familial relationship somewhat, so there is little doubt about you returning to help."

Students who enter express in their first year had time to acclimatise and adapt to the pace, so by the time they reach secondary 3, they have got used to it.\n\nBut for you, you do not have the \"advantage\" the rest have. To be honest, even I as an Express student was barely coping with the pace, but I seek help from study cliques, extra classes and getting advice from my teachers. \n\nSome of my friends who took the same leap as you also struggle for a bit to get used to the tempo, but they eventually got there."

He mentioned that he was doing well in NA but the pace in express stream was too fast for him. I remember what he did was he did not give up, he consulted teachers and classmates regularly to catch up on his school work. It took time but he showed improvements after awhile. My advice is to consult your teachers too (if you're unsure of things) and to form a study group with your classmates. All the best to you! :)"

If being in Express stream is making you stressed out and making your studies worse, then it'd actually hinder your chance for further education. You wouldn't want to score badly for 'o's and ended up not being able to take the path you want. You can still take 'o's in sec5(?) Correct me if I'm wrong haha. \n\nBut then again, higher education is tougher than sec sch standard, so you can try to get accustomed to the increased work load! That being said, I know a lot of people who did manage to get into uni even if they went thru sec5/ITE route and what not. So what I'm trying to say is try your best, and don't be too stressed out!!! Sec sch was the last carefree days I had and I regretted not enjoying my days then more. There will always be a way for you in life :) goodluck!\n\nEdit - I saw that you mentioned the teachers seem stricter and are killing your motivations to study. Please don't forget that you always have your NA teachers to fall back to, and u can always reach out to them with your issues! They should be able to handle your homework issues too, if you really find it hard to approach your express teachers."

Mind you, he is not that very studious, he also plays basketball A LOT! In has last year before O levels we have to send him to tuition centers for his english and maths and thankfully he got a decent O levels scores. We're not those parents that demands or wants high grades, all we asked our kids is try their best to at least pass their subjects. He is now doing JC in Millennia Institute as he wanted  to avoid the 2 yrs grind of the usual JC.  Since you are in express already, congratulations! you just need to suck it up and beat it! If you plan to go to Uni, try to align your subjects now with the Uni course subject requirements. Dont take for granted your minor subjects now as often times they are already give aways and will help in your L1R5 scores, thats where my son made a mistake, got one or two of his minor subjects low hence his L1R5 suffered a bit. Suggest you also find study mates (the good ones :) ), it help my son as well in his maths and english subjects. Often times, asking for help from your teachers, buddies, parents help a lot if you are in tough situations. One last thing, learn to manage your time to study, to hang out with friends, family or play games. You will need this skill if you will be going to JC and Uni."

You need not study with your classmates specifically. \n\nif your teachers do not offer the help you need, I would suggest tuition as a last resort. I know there are some organisations such as CDAC, mendaki that offers tuition for students under financial aid; you could always check this out too.\n\nAll in all, I would say that as the syllabus gets more rigid and tough as teachers tend to just cramp answers into students, but learning doesn't have to stop there for you, learning is what you define and you could always search for it outside of school.\n\n Stay strong and jiayou!"

Teachers tend to have a good gauge of which student can explain concepts well too. Mine did that for me and God bless her, I managed to pass my math + improve my science.

You don't really need a degree in IT to do IT, just the relevant certifications, like the CISCO security certs. You just need to know the products well.\n\nOr maybe a career in finance would be good, if you're ok dealing with money and crunching numbers.\n\nIf you prefer a less desk-bound job, you can try project engineer in the construction field (long hours and tough working conditions though), while trying to get your safety officer certificate. This way, you can run a project while knowing which areas to safeguard. Engineering is however, a very long route before you become a manager or director. \n\nEngineering also has a design route (deskbound) for people who want to become Professional Engineers, but you need a degree in civil engineering first.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being a safety officer for life. It's just that you have to be contented with a decent but not spectacular salary, as safety is a cost centre rather than a profit-making entity. You can probably get some private experience first before applying to MOM to become a safety auditor in future, if stability is what you are looking for.\n\nMy 2 cents."

And the fixed laptop looks like crap and cant shut seamlessly. And yes we did question them and they say its normal.\n\nAlso to OP, usually there will be a contract stating employee who damages the company property will have to bear the cost. If no contract was signed or covered that, you might have a chance to get a warning and thats all."

Why?  \n\n\n\" The term \u2018dhobi-ghat\u2019 refers it to be the world\u2019s largest outdoor laundry, which is traditionally associated with Chakali (washermen) community. Dhobi or Chakali caste is at the **lowest position in Hindu social order**. They are performers of the most crucial task (cleanliness), and still, today trapped in the **throes of poverty, illiteracy, social discrimination, and the remnants of untouchability.** Therefore, the paper attempts to understand the socio-political status of an unprivileged washermen community (Chakali), who comes under the constitutional classification of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Telangana. This investigation, in general, has attempted to outline the verifiable beginnings of the Chakali group, by inspecting of writings of eminent scholars while for getting an in-depth understanding at the grassroots level of their socio-political status.\"  \n\n\nAs I see it- for this very reason- They are shouting and yelling at you. Because your business is like bad luck to them. Imagine having a restaurant beside a funeral parlor.  \n\n\nMy advice- stay calm and ride it out. Their business won't last very long.    \n\n\nFor the time being- if your family is pragmatic, you can approach an Indian temple and ask for their advice about placing  the Lord Ganesha  at your shop front. I think it would elevate the attacks..  \n\n\nGood Luck"

It was very frustrating cause I could tell she isn't an ADHD specialist. So I'm looking for other hospitals where other people/ girls specifically got a better chance at diagnosis.\n\nIf you don't mind, could you share which hospital you got the diagnosis from? Would a letter really expedite the process lol cause showing the prescription papers they ignored it and basically decided I just had general anxiety disorder :\")"

If you want to migrate, look at what jobs are in demand in the country that you're intending to go to and try to get into those fields. Migration is not as easy as it sounds. \n\nAlso, you have wanderlust now, but when it comes to actually migrating, you need to consider what is actually like to live in the places you're intending to go to as a foreigner. Singapore is extremely convenient for getting to most parts of the world for travel because of its location, you can get direct flights to most countries, whereas if you live in places like Australia and Canada, if you intend to go anywhere other than domestically, it requires layovers. So you need to determine yourself whether you will be content with just domestic travel. You need to think about whether you'll be happy with domestic travel for the rest of your life. \n\nEvery country and city has its pros and cons, and these are things you can only figure out if it's acceptable for yourself."

So my personal opinion is to get watches that is something that you like. Unless you are those flippers and score good deals on carousell.\n\nI found a nice Zelos (local microbrand) watch on carousell for a very cheap price and now that brand is a lot more popular and their watches are in higher demand, and i can easily sell it for double or maybe even triple the price soon. But this scenario is extremely rare, as the brand increased its worth in the recent years, and model is discontinued for some time, and the watch is still in good condition, and bought it for cheap. But even for such good thing, theres still a invisible cap on the highest value it will fetch since other better watches are worth buying than mine."

If the watch brand have good service, they will even help you resize it for free if you walk in another day. My friend recently bought two Tissots and thats what the guy told us. Then buying any 3rd party strap the strap shop should also help you swap the straps for free.\n\nFor watches movement, theres three category mainly. Quartz (Battery), Automatic (kinetic movement charged), Mechanical Winding (twist the crown).\n\nBut here are some exceptions. Some Quartz watches uses Solar techology to recharge the battery. Some Automatic watches have Mechanical Winding built into it so you can wind it up and it should stay recharged by kinetic movement from your wrist.\n\nSeiko got a wide range of watches, so just look at the specs of the watch and see what type of automatic it is, example, \"Automatic with manual winding capacity\".\n\nHere is a quick fyi for what to expect from different watch movements. If you expect just to set the time once and want the most accurate time and never have to care for years, get Quartz for sure. a $40 Quartz Casio can tell more accurate time than almost all high end watches in the hundred of thousand dollar range.\n\nBut if why Quartz is so good and affordable, why isnt all the high end watches using Quartz? Cuz to watch enthusiast, a watch is both a piece of art and engineering marvel, so using battery powered quartz is like cheating and using hundreds of tiny moving parts is more valuable. And also, quartz can never beat the feeling of taking a 50 year old vintage watch out from the drawer and just a wind or two and it still ticks fine and keep time well.\n\nFor Automatic watches with winding, if you wear it daily, it should still stay accurate to the minute after a week or two if the watch is good, and usually the weekends if not wearing it, the watch will stop running and need to wind it up when you wear it again. Winding the watch to start the day is actually fun and I enjoy doing it.\n\nHope this helps. :D"

If your watch isnt gonna be like thousand dollar worth then no need to concern cuz theres some horror story of unskilled watch shop staff scratching the watch when working on it."

But their Presage watches are mostly in the $600+ range, and some models have even doubled in price as Seiko love to do limited edition run and they sometimes make really unique and beautiful pieces, example would be the  **SARY085**.  \n\n\nAlso maybe can consider other brands that fall in your budget, like Orient, they do make amazing cheap automatics and yet still look good."

A cert in accountancy is a good addition for your resume . \n\nIf the finance sector is your interest, I suggest looking into banking & finance when you go to Polytechnic. If you have good sales and interpersonal skills, you can make a successful career in providing financial services and maintaing investment portfolios for wealthy individuals.\n\nI also agree with other redditors who have commented. The demand for accountants will reduce in the future. I suggest also looking into Business IT, Fintech, Business Data Analytics and even Cybersecurity or Software Engineering when you are furthering your education in Polytechnic, University and beyond. These are fields that will see a rise in demand in the future. If I could turn back time I would have taken up a diploma in these fields instead. Hope this helps!"

                "comment": "You're conflating microeconomics with macroeconomics.\n\nFirstly, there is no iron law of economics that state that wage growth must rise with productivity growth. There are observable data and regression analysis (most recently see 2017 Stansbury and Summers: Productivity and Pay) that seem to indicate that productivity might be one of the components that lead to wage growth, but not the only one, and the ratio is not certain.\n\nSecondly, the above is a macroeconomic observation not a microeconomic one. Individual cases like yours do not play a part in the larger topic of whether productivity leads to wage increases.\n\nTo put it even more bluntly, even if it's true that productivity of workers as a whole does lead to a certain amount of  wage growth of that group of workers, it does not mean that an individual worker productivity growth will lead to their own salary increment.\n\nThere are so many factors involved in growing your own salary that are outside the realm of economics, often its not even productivity in doing your main job that counts. \n\nFor example, if you are extremely skilled at doing Job, let's say peeling eggs (as in Takagi Ramen story where the subject was was able to do double the amount as the average worker), vs another worker who is average at peeling eggs, but is great at ensuring the team is constantly working together to achieve the larger goal of serving the ramen fast and efficiently. Usually the latter will be rewarded faster and be more critical to the operations. \n\nThis is not even considering factors like \"does the employer conduct annual reviews and increments\", \"is the position a dead-end position and easily fillable\" etc.\n\nThere is one aspect of macroeconomics that directly leads to higher or lower salary as you pointed out which is the law of supply and demand. I don't think anyone can run from that in the long run. However, there is another law called the iron law of wages (which applies when supply is greater or equal to demand), which state that the minimum wage of a country tends towards the base subsistence level to survive (not the artificial mandated MW, but the true MW set by the aggregate demand of the society). Singapore of course practices no MW, so the true MW is really close to the subsistence level of the society since we are at zero to low unemployment and is optimally controlled by foreign worker allowances."

                "comment": "As food deliverymen, we are self-employed, and it is to our interest to maximise our earnings, given our limited 24 hours in a day. \n\nOn average as a cyclist (from experience) during peak hours, I could do around 1.5 orders per hour, so $5 x 1.5 = $7.50/hr. \n\nHowever, depending on your neighbourhood & mode of transport, earnings can vary very significantly. Here are some considerations to min-maxing your experience delivering food:\n\nTerrain Steepness/Stamina\n- This one applies more to bicycles, where the more hills you have to climb, the slower your delivery time, which would affect your pay per hour\n- Also, as you are providing the legs, the # of hours you can work (tahan) is heavily reliant on your current stamina\n- Does not really apply to electric/fuel powered vehicles, as the engines do the hill climbing for you, and hence you can work for longer hours without tiring out as much\n\nAverage Queue Times\n- In most neighbourhoods, your main \"food collection hub\" would mostly be at the shopping centres near major MRTs\n- In every \"hub\", there are restaurants with shorter waiting times & others with longer meeting times (>1h)\n- Sometimes, time waited is time wasted. While waiting for your order, make a good judgement for yourself. Weigh whether the extra weekly incentive is worth waiting for, or whether you could be better off taking an alternative order \n- And if you just dont like the \"hub\", nobody is stopping you from cycling to alternative \"hubs\" for business\n\nDelivery Demand\n- Some neighbourhoods have better delivery demand than others, i.e. more orders & eateries with longer continuous demand\n- your profit = # of hours worked x ave. hourly pay\n- the more continuous your demand, the more flexible your delivery schedule can be, and also the longer you can work on the job\n\nGrab vs Deliveroo\n- Grab is more flexible, as you don't have to book your time slots. So Grab whenever you wanna off, after your last order you off. Deliveroo have to do throughout the shift you book\n- I can't testify for Deliveroo, but I heard demand is abit better there as there are lesser riders. But i heard that Deliveroo HQ will call you and rush if you are late for every delivery\n\ntl;dr Since you are just starting out, try out whatever to optimize your experience food delivery ba, important is to not burn-out within the first week, so do pace yourself!"

For GrabFood the money that u will earn per trip ranges from around $4+ to 6$ but mostly the trips are $4.50 to $5.50. Even if you are a casual/Just starting out biker Should be easily able to earn $50+ per day. The other day i did casually like 9am to 11am and 12.15pm to 5pm got like $ 50+, + the tips and incentives cause it was a weekend got like close to $70 for near 7hours. But i can say Luck plays a factor too sometimes u get those near 4km trips for like $5+ almost 6$ but bo hua one deliver to them then no job liao on ur way back then need cycle to nearest mall again, Meanwhile sometimes got a trip that is just opposite of the mall and i get like 4.50$. Invest in a good bicycle get a decent mountain bike if not when u going upslope tell u ah u going to struggle u wont know where u going to also"

You won't be tied to Singapore but you have an obligation to pay for it otherwise your guarantor will be the one getting the short end of the stick.\n\n\n2. As a fresh graduate, it will be be highly difficult for you to get a job overseas with limited or no work experience at all. Ask yourself this: What skillset will I have that makes you more employable than any other local applicants? Why would the local employer pay more to hire me and go through the extra trouble?\n\n\n3. This is really down to individual and how gungho you are. Also, it depends on the local property law. If you are renting in UK for example, you'll need to pay 4 weeks worth of deposit as an advance. Transferwise is a common option these days where you can have a multi currency account. Most local banks will want proof of your residency there before they will allow you to open an account.\n\n\nYou'll also want to have enough money because you won't find your SGD3 chicken rice anywhere or any cheap hawker foods abroad.\n\n\nThe other side of the world always seem so green and lush but if you've never been there for at least a visit, I'd strongly encourage to do so to get an idea before you even decide to make a jump. Not every place is as forgiving and affordable as SG.\n\n\nDo think about transport, safety, rental, career options, cost of living in general.\n\n\nAs an example: I'm living just outside of London now but my monthly transport costs (not driving, just public transport costs) can add up to SGD 600+ each month vs ~SGD100 in Singapore? . Yes you may find the amount ridiculous but don't base anything on Singapore's standard and definitely do your own in depth research.\n\n\nGood luck."

                "comment": "Hi, I lived in Aussie for about 5 years, did my undergrad there. I guess I can help out in point 2 and 3. Not much of 1.\n\n**2. Job Application**\n\nI don't want to make you disappointed or wtv but the job market in Aussie now looks REALLY bad. Like seriously bad. It is extremely hard to get hired as a foreigner now, and in the next few years or so (in light of the pandemic and also like SG, the locals there are complaining about job securities and stuff like that). If you look at Australia now, the unemployment rate is rising, and that is for locals. As a foreigner, I honestly don't think you'd stand a chance as a fresh graduate. Maybe if you have years of work experience in a particular industry, and migrate there for work then yes, a possibility.\n\nThe visas that they offer for expats or professionals also depend on the job title. It differs by state. So you can read about which states demand jobs of a certain profession. The last I've checked, the professions in demand are quite niche. So you need to be really skilled in a certain profession.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that might be possible is, study there. Get some work experience in Aussie/NZ and go from there (but also, it is not a guaranteed job after graduation. Many of my friends did this, but still had to return to SG eventually as they were not keen on hiring foreigners).\n\n**3. Financial Budget**\n\nI would say, depends on state. But I would say at least 10k at the minimum (with a little savings to keep you alive while looking for a job).\n\nRent in Aussie costs about AUD 350/week for a 1BR apartment. When I was there, rent was paid fortnightly. So about AUD 700 per month. Utility bills are charges separate, water and electricity would cost about AUD 250.00 per quarter? (would need to check on this, I can't really remember) Internet would be AUD 79.90 per month for 1,000GB of Data. So housing expenses would already cost you about AUD 900 per month.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add, you need to pay at least 2 weeks' rental deposit as well. So about AUD 700)\n\nFood would be pricier if you eat out (about AUD15 per meal), I suggest cooking your own meals. AUD 55 would be good for a week's worth of groceries. That would be AUD 220 per month.\n\nIf you are able to drive (and I would recommend you to get your license because driving would be so much easier for you to find a job, you're not restricted by distance and transport), you can get a cheap car for about AUD 2k to 3k (nothing fancy, get you from point A to point B without dying on you). The license plate renewal fee goes by 3 months, 6 months and 1 year (price depends on how heavy your car is). I would say about AUD 300ish for 6 months for a regular sedan?\n\nAnd yes, you need to open a bank account first in Australia. I would suggest bringing as much Aussie dollar in cash as u need with you first (of course you have to be within airline regulations) and after you have managed to open a bank account in Aussie, you can ask your parents to do a Telegraphic Transfer of the remaining amounts into your aussie account from Singapore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: spelling error"

Put a profile photo, a summary, a title, etc. You can use [mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryansetozhanyuan/) as an example \n2. Try to post [once a week](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryansetozhanyuan/detail/recent-activity/shares/), it will let your post reach out to more people and making you more contactable \n3. When you do a LinkedIn search on your seniors, you may use the company name like \"Unilever\" or a role \"Digital Marketing Analyst\"\n4. Read their profile and understand them. Find one thing that you like about them, you will use it in (6)\n5. Click on the '**Connect**' button and then '**Add a note**'\n6. Use this template: \"Hi XXX, I came across your profile and I like what you did for (a project name or company) at (year/month). Personally, I am an aspiring marketing professional and I am seeking opportunities in MNCs as a (the role that you want). Could you share more about your day to day responsibilities at your workplace?\n7. Ask all the questions you can with at least 2 to 3 more replies:\n\n* What software do you usually use?\n* What's your greatest challenge?\n* What do you enjoy doing the most?\n\n1. Finally, asking for a referral: \"Thank you for sharing all these, XXX. By any chance, if your company is hiring entry-level marketing roles at the moment? Your work culture is interesting and I would love to join the team.\"\n2. Whether they reject or accept, thank them for their time and keep in touch. Sometimes even ask them out for lunch to connect. Socialise more! \n\nI hope these helped you"

To legalized documents by Indonesia Notaris -  Birth Cert, Passport, KTP, ROM cert (both english and bahasa) and 2 ICA letters (eng and bahasa) . This only can be done in Indonesia (eg Batam/Jakarta, not availabe in Singapore)\n3. To go into SAKE website to register and activate your account and start filling in as per your guide.\n4. To upload documents and make payment. To upload payment slip as proof.\n5. Once paid and confirmed to submit the Hardcopy documents to AHU.\n6. Once Surat permohonan is approved by AHU, the letter of approval can be downloaded from SAKE page. \n7. To send the Letter of Approval(soft copy) for translation by sworn translator. This photocopy of translated approval letter need to be legalized by KBRI first. To do so, need to make appointment via email with KBRI to go down for Surrendering passport and CTC Service (Legalisir), both can be done on the same day.\n8. Lastly for ICA appointment, need to bring the SAKE Approval letter in Eng and Indonesia (x2 each - that is translated and legalized by KBRI), letter of passport surrendered to KBRI (provided by KBRI when surrending passport with stamps on document, Photo x4, and NRIC."

Step 1 - 16 July (submit and collect from his house within the same day).\n2. Step 2 - 17 July (sent via DHL). Received by Bun Hai on 20jul. Bun Hai sent back via DHL on 21 Jul. I received back on 23 Jul\n3 and 4. Submit all docs online to sake on 23 jul. Paid on 24Jul and submitted proof of payment on 24 Jul.\n5. Sent the documents to Sake on 24Jul and they received on 27jul.\n6. First verification tick on 30jul, second tick on 3aug, third to fifth ticks on 04aug.\n7. Translate the approval letter by Anwar on 05aug (submit and collect on the same day). Made online appointment for legalization in KBRI. Earliest only on 24Aug!! So I need to wait till 24 aug for that. Surrender of passport can be done any day according to KBRI. My ICA appointment is on 31Aug.\n\nSo technically if u follow exactly the guide by Jonathan, you can do it within 21 days up to point 7. The one that likely to delay you is the KBRI appointment for legalization. \n\nHope it helps and thanks again Jonathan!"

I met quite a few people who are rejected to go inside KBRI because of there's no appointment letter from Konsular part. I was lucky since I get both letter from konsular and immigration on the same day.\n\nThe things they did was ask the security (the one who are tending the gate) to help you get inside for surrendering your passport, since afterall you did get a reply for passport surrendering ( Don't forget to print out the letter).\n\nOnce you are there, proceed to surrender your passport. After that go to second floor, wait until the second floor queue died down, and beg the official there to help you to get your document legalize.\n\nSome of the officials will help you. But some are nasty. My advise is band together with the people who are stuck like you,  to try to ask different official. Once you guys knew which official is nice. Ask the nice official and wait until the nasty one went away.\n\nAlways remember to keep a nice humble tone and beg them (the security and officials ). It work out well for them eventho they didnt have any appointment for konsular / protkons part."

If you join a company doing these projects, the amount of projects in Singapore alone good enough. Then if your company go other places to do Smart projects the opportunity is almost endless.\n\nSmart City engineers is like city architects.\n\nCloud systems industry is quite limited wouldn't recommend for growth.\n\nEnd of story is there's no right or wrong, after 2 years studying which one you prefer?\n\nAsk yourself you want a to work project based or operations. Either ways ask the company the growth opportunities. Not in terms of promotion, but how much you'll be given opportunity to keep learning new things.\n\nEsp in Smart City as new tech comes there'll be new ways to implement and sell things. What's Smart today is stupid tmr. By learning this is how you can sell yourself to your company.\n\nCybersecurity the stage seems dynamic with so many attacks, but the key factors around them are more or less the same.\nYou need to go around listen to ppl or see how ppl attack and defend, what's their methodologies. More of a creatives industry. Then see how to adopt those methods to your organisation. Once you have those standards in place, then we talk about operations, threat hunt, forensics, red teaming.\n\nGo Google NIST framework for cybersecurity see if you are interested."

A place in singapore with all those is t galleria! Also the airport transit area has alot of the similar stores! Just check out agencies which does the hiring eg promopower, cstaffing ( HOWEVER I DO STRONGLY recommend not to go to those agencies due to the fact that they have BAD service towards the workers there eg changing of working location without prior information to us and just directly telling the brand, losing of personal documents which made us have to re make our documents at our own money!

However I think it's still quite easy to build one yourself, as generally the more common and popular parts can be found easily, but sold near MSRP and don't expect any great discounts.\n\nIn regards to the avenue of buying parts, SLS is definitely still the best for shop physically, and I feel it's quite easy to shop there by just picking up the printed price lists when you are there to compare prices between the different shops. The prices are usually final and it's hard to haggle much.\n\nWhen it comes online shopping, alot of the products u find on local eshopping websites, such as qoo10, Lazada and shopee, are sold by the shop owners in SLS as well, (tho there are also others that operate out of their own warehouse) If you can identify the more prominent shops names it would prob be more assuring when buying parts online, but this would require quite some time to research haha"

The trend these days if one wants to spec out their own PC is to just get one from Aftershock or similar indie builders (some of whom work from home).\n\nIt's the same problem in some other DIY markets, like for bike/car parts, spare parts for household appliances, woodworking, etc. We just pay professionals to get shit done, to hell with even learning how things work."

BTO is good if you're able to grab the grants as well, otherwise if you factor in the above, you won't be making much profit when you sell in the future.\n\nIs BTO a long term investment? I feel no, but given the options available, BTO is still the best in the market, I feel if you want to buy a property now, buy for the need, not the greed, whatever profit you make from your current one, you'll have to put into renovation for the new house as well.\n\nWhen you calculate remember to keep 20k in CPF OA to enjoy the 3.5% interest"

In normal times, these public hospitals that treat mental health are overloaded with waiting times of 2 to 3 months ( worse still if you are subsidised vs private patient).  These days more people are aware and willing to seek mental health treatment hence the increased demand and long waiting times. \n\n Now, with the covid-19 situation,  the waiting times are even longer.  My son had a February appointment at NUH for his ADHD therapy (that i waited 2 months for) indefinitely postponed, without any replacement date given. Reason given is NUH have to put such non urgent cases on hold for now. I also wonder why psychologists have to be involved in covid 19?"

Hence, there has been an increase in encouraging the citizenry to improve IT proficiency. \n\nDepending on which intrigues you, institutional demands (i.e govt/ public sector) would most definitely welcome security experts to ensure the safeguard of the systems in place. \n\nAnother approach is public sector jobs.

This means tapping onto our IT infrastructure to expand regionally. Someone\u2019s gonna need to manage that stuff.... could it be you? \n\nI really appreciate how forward thinking we are."

Else, you can tell him you will help him screw it if he meet you at a public place.(Always be in full view of cctvs if you meet him)\n\nIF he rejects your offer and demand full refund, screenshot it and keep just in case.

For any of the local schools to consider launching a vet course, there must first be enough interest. Considering that they would need to hire multiple qualified lecturers to teach the various modules, have specialised equipment available for hands on practicals, and establish a system of testing, the costs associated with launching it would be rather high. An annual intake of a hundred or so probably wouldn't cut it.\n\nDoes Singapore need that many new vets every year? Is the industry big enough to give most of them jobs? Most importantly, can you tempt enough people to give up a promising career as a doctor, to become a vet?\n\nIf the answer to the above is yes, CONGRATULATIONS! You have identified a supply shortfall in the market. Get some market research done, draw up a business proposal, find investors and business partners, and proceed to make mad dough."
