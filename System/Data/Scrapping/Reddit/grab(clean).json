                "comment": "i was driving grab full time for 2 weeks last month while waiting for school to start, so i have some experience and hopefully can answer your questions.i drive about 14-16h a day, 7 days a week, typically from 7am-1pm, then 3pm-1am. the peak period starts at around 7am, if you start earlier, there's a chance you might end up in cbd too early and have to go back to the heartland area for better fares. after lunch, things start to quieten down a bit and picks up again at about 4pm, so if you want some rest or shut-eye, this is the best time to do so. the evening peak hours and nights tend to be better in terms of job availability, and i normally drive until i get a job that brings me closer to home, and then go offline from there. on a typical day, i drive about 400-500km.by doing so, i earn a revenue of about high $400s to low $500 a day, but it can sometimes get up to high $500s if it's your lucky day. after deducting rental ($87/day), petrol (~$30/day) and commission (20% of fares which is about $80-$100), i can take home about high $200s to low $300s a day, which works out to be about $20/hr of profit. however, i have to say there is quite a fair bit of day to day variability, which i cannot account for since i have not driven long enough to notice a trend. perhaps other drivers can help you better there. in the 16 days i've worked for, i earned about $4000, and if you maintain for a month, it shouldn't be difficult to earn about $8000, given that there are some days that i did not drive a full day.as for the incentives, the most recent update severely limited what we can earn in terms of incentives, with each gem (think of it as points) giving you $0.40, instead of about $0.85 last time. they also have a rental rebate, which gives you back 6% (i think) of your fares to offset your car rental.gojek is definitely better for incentives, esp the most recent one. if you hit the max target in a day, you get an extra $205 of profit, which is certainly doable if you drive the whole day. they recently upped the incentive, but i haven't checked it out in detail, so i can't help you there.however, i do have to agree with what the others have said. gojek's matching seem to be quite flawed, as i had a few jobs where i had to drive about 10 minutes to get to the customer, and there is some waiting around involved during the lull hours. the fares seem to be lower on gojek as well, but to put it in another perspective, regardless of whether you drive on grab or gojek, the fares of the jobs you get will always be lower since most customers are price sensitive and would opt for the cheaper option anyways.hope this helps clarify! feel free to pm me if you need more info"

                "comment": "full time grab veteran here. there is absolutely good money still to be made, under certain conditions at least. the biggest one being the often-overlooked one, are you okay with driving a lot. drive to kl non-stop, spend half an hour at a hawker center, drive back. nine hours in the car, does that sound like a lot? because to me, that's tuesday. wednesday, time to do it again...&#x200b;as far as the money goes, i drive a total of about fifty hours a week. which is less than you'd think honestly, because i don't have a commute sucking up time before/after work, and it's potentially spread across seven days, not five. after all car expenses are paid for, i pocket about $1k a week (and of course i get a car to drive, how valuable is that perk to you personally?). imo, the people who can't make that much are doing one of two things wrong. the first/obvious one being driving a car that has crappy fuel mileage. if you're driving for hire full time, most cars have crappy mileage (kilometerage?). grab's two most popular rental cars use less than 7l/100km. if your car uses 10+, that's a lot of money spent wasting fuel. at 10l/100km you're spending over $100 more per week on fuel than i am. is your current car worth spending an extra $400+ a month on? use the right tool for the job.&#x200b;the larger thing that people get wrong (in the sense of \"making less money per hour\") is driving too many lower-income hours. the middle of the day is slow, so working from 7-7 isn't going to get you $30+ an hour. the best times are weekends, like 10am to 11pm (a couple weeks ago i drove seven hours on sunday and got $290 in fares). during the week, the best times are 5:30 -10:30pm. mornings not quite so much so, you got the double whammy of bad traffic, and high downtime whenever you have to drive from downtown to a suburb without a passenger. also it's only busy for about two hours, 7:30-9:30, goes down fast after that. the rest of the hours of the day are well, the rest. so the key to making good money is to get a lot of those hours i listed. seven hours on weekdays (bit more on friday), fourteen on saturday, twelve on sunday. how many of those 62 hours are you willing to work? this isn't a 9-5 job where you hang with your buddies on the evenings. evenings and weekends is where the money's at. if you work a six day week, your day off is monday.&#x200b;as far as the incentives go, well yeah grab just lowered things a bit. that said, they used to adjust the incentives every single week. and in truth, it doesn't matter that much. i mean sure you want to optimize the bonuses when practical, but the incentives are mostly just there to encourage certain hours more than others. and in the long term, the average hourly rate has stayed remarkably constant. early on, when fares were super cheap to attract new customers, and there was a lot of downtime, incentives were higher to compensate. when lta screwed up the rollout of the pdvl license, and a lot of drivers got forcibly sidelined, there were surges all the time, and drivers did made more money despite the incentives going down. when grab absorbed uber drivers over the course of two weeks, the price plummeted (despite the conventional opinion, the uber merger made grab far cheaper). but but, you say, weren't prices rising in april and may? yeah, but grab took in the uber drivers back in early march, it only got into the press because of lta in april. and what was happening in april? after seeing a month solid of lower fares, drivers started leaving. a process that accelerated in april and may, then stopped by the end of june, with income having returned to... the same place it was the summer of the previous year. so if grab lowers the incentive too much, some drivers will quit, and surge will go up until income returns to the long-term average.&#x200b;tl;dr: drive the right hours in the right car, make $1k+ a week, learn to eat late dinners."

(not sure of the numbers) and that lioncity rental and grab rental is much lower iirc. then essentially comfort will have drivers returning cabs to them as they can get cheaper vehicles and comfort will suffer in rental revenue.tldr: comfort needs to rival grab or end up being just a taxi fleet renter company."

(yes, the other user mentioned about the costs, expertise and experience in maintaining the app, but having an app of your own can ensure that \"cut\" of trip expenses to go back into your own pocket rather than grab.)that's just my thoughts.

                "comment": "\"no incentives because i chose the highest fares available and my ar drop to 40%.\"well if you're driving for grab, that's your mistake right there. right now their passenger rates are really low, so to compensate their driver bonuses are really high. skipping the bonuses is quite a bad idea.i drive regularly for grab, i make about $25 an hour after petrol and grab's incentives (but before considering the rather large cost of a car). you can rent most cars for under $75 a day, so it takes 21 hours a week of driving to pay for the car itself. after that, $5-600 in my pocket per week. a lot of that is the incentives... grab basically controls their driver supply through the incentive systems. no incentive at all is really painful.edit: i don't really know the specifics of the tribecar deal. it might not actually be worth it. but from what i can see, the other half of your problem is that your total # of trips + fares is really awful. during the same time period today, i drove nine trips, total fare of $121.50 (which is actually pretty low), and my incentives should end up somewhere around $35 i think. so if you'd made $155 gross, you'd have netted about $93. not great for six hours, but not awful for a job that lets you sit in aircon and socialize. better than the grease pits of mcds...extra extra edit: why the heck are you making three stops for petrol? that's a huge time sink, given that you're paying so per hour to rent the car. is this some part of tribecar's deal? if so that does suck. if not... refuel once only, on the way back to the car depot."

                "comment": "if the cost of solving the problem is more than what the customer values it at, there is a problem. they lose money because they have high costs. these costs include the talent they hire at huge premiums, cost of providing esops to leaders and staff as well as subsidies they payout specifically to gather market share.as of right now, nobody except those privy to their inner working know how the losses are estimated and how costs are calculated. there are a lot of back door deals which take place specifically to appease investors. like grab consuming the services of companies which are also owned by their investors. for the sake of following the process a rfp exercise would be done but parameters are tweaked such that there are only those suitors left in the race. all companies do it. effectively cash is paid out to these companies and losses booked at grab.also the entire basis of calculating losses is what defines whether they are operational losses or paper losses. twitter till some time back also had losses because it was doling out bucketful of esops and that needs to be paid for.with grab it\u2019s particularly convoluted because instead of doing a ipo where they would have make their inner workings public they chose the spac route where they don\u2019t need to disclose much.also with the 1$ hike it\u2019s a smart move. they may even give out the same 1$ back as a discount but remember the way it gets accounted is that it adds to the revenue (top line) first and then you reduce the operational cost of driver payouts and subsidies etc.illustration - if grab does 500k rides a day in sg for an average price of 6$ it gives it a top line of approx 1bn/year. now with covid their rides fall 30% so obviously the top line would be 700m. so they increase the price by 1$ which now puts the top line at 895m improving it by 30%. it\u2019s irrelevant whether they are paying it to the driver or subsiding it. their only aim to show earnings which determine their valuation. that is also the reason you see a 30c insurance fee and maybe as they want to top line growth in the future they will keep adding more such charges, often taking them off as discounts later. discounts get charged as losses separately.right now grab has a race to show a certain revenue to get the best valuation and listing premium. after that they will rest easy!"

assault and attempted rape of a 19-year-old passenger he picked up from a bar two years ago.> tan yew sin, 46, is contesting a charge each of attempted rape, sexual assault and outrage of modesty, which he allegedly committed on the victim in his car.> advertisement> advertisement> according to the prosecution, tan accepted a booking in the early hours of may 19, 2018, to ferry the victim from wildseed bar at seletar aerospace park to her home.> details of the victim's home were redacted from court documents as she is protected by gag order.> the victim had gone to the bar with her friends the night before and drank about five glasses of beer throughout the evening, said the prosecution.> a friend helped her to book a grab car, and two friends noticed she was tipsy, crying and could not walk straight.> advertisement> advertisement> they helped her to the car, and told tan that the victim was drunk, passing a plastic bag in case she needed to throw up during the journey.> the victim's friend was heard in the in-car camera footage played in court asking the accused to help take her home, thanking him and asking the victim to send a text when she got home.> > the victim lay down in the back seat, crying when tan tried to talk to her, said deputy public prosecutors muhamad imaduddien, chew xin ying and emily koh.> she fell asleep and was woken up by tan when they reached her residence. she alighted but could not access the side gate.> tan led her back to car when she could not enter gate> tan, who is married with three children, saw her looking \"lost and unsteady\", and took her back to his car after she squatted down and began crying.> in statements to the police, tan said that the victim became agitated while in his car and banged her head on the window while crying.> he went to the back seat to console her, and searched her belongings to find out where she lived and took her phone to call someone to get her.> however, instead of helping her home, he began committing sexual offences on her, kissing her before attempting to rape her, alleged the prosecutors.> according to them, tan later drove to a more secluded area and began molesting the victim and sexually assaulting her.> he eventually helped the victim back to her residence and drove off.> for reasons unknown, the victim did not go home and was found by another grab driver at around 4.40am, lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing.> he called the police and waited until an ambulance arrived. the paramedic will testify that the victim was crying and kept struggling when she tried to examine her, said the prosecution. tan's dna was later found in the victim's underwear.> defence likely to argue victim consented> defence lawyers chenthil kumarasingam and adeline goh agree on some facts in the case, including that the victim was crying during the car ride from the bar to her home.> the prosecution will lead evidence from 32 witnesses and tender footage from closed-circuit television cameras and tan's in-car camera.> the footage shows the victim sobbing throughout the car ride, with tan repeatedly asking her what happened and if she had just broken up.> in tan's statements to the police, he admitted that he had not asked the victim for consent, but claimed that she \"participated in some of the sexual acts\".> the prosecutors said tan is likely to argue that he believed in good faith that the victim consented to the sexual acts.> however, they said alarm bells ought to have been raised in tan's mind regarding the victim's behaviour, including her crying, lack of response to his questions, appearing lost and unsteady and that her friend had said she was drunk.> a blood specimen from the victim was later found to contain 26mg per 100ml of blood, with an estimated blood alcohol content at 3am that day in the range of 132.2 to 155.9mg per 100 ml of blood.> the victim's inability to remember events in tan's car may indicate an alcohol blackout, or that she was in deep sleep from alcohol consumption, said the prosecutors.> a consultant from the institute of mental health will testify that the victim was significantly intoxicated and incapable of giving consent to sexual activity, the prosecution added.> when contacted by cna, a grab spokesperson said tan has been banned from grab's platform.> \"our users\u2019 safety is important to us and we have zero tolerance for indecent behaviour, harassment or abuse of any kind. users who have displayed indecent behaviour will be banned from the platform,\" she said.> > the trial continues. if convicted of attempted rape or sexual assault by penetration, tan could be jailed for up to 20 years, fined, or caned.> if found guilty of outrage of modesty, he could be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) |

(after the ride i realised i would've been able to but in all the hullabaloo, i was stressed!) so now, my eyes were darting around his car and i was thinking if i could possibly make the timing for my lesson and get a pair of pants! the memorable part comes now, as the driver looks at me, tells me to look behind the head rest and says that i can take his pair of pants for the lesson. he ensured it was clean and all because he uses it for prayers. my initial reaction was \"how am i supposed to give this back to you??\" to which he responded with a \"it's alright\" as if to say my predicament was more important at this moment. so i assuredly took the pants, wore it over my shorts while in his car, and when for my lesson.i didn't have this guy's name, number, car plate number or any type of identification at all! i've never seen nor heard from this driver again but i really hope that there are others like him out there, who would help their passengers out in the spur of the moment, even though they know they'll probably not get any recognition for it. if somewhere, somehow you are reading this though my cab driver, thank you very much for your spontaneity on the day and please do know that you can go for driving lessons in shorts! haha"

                "comment": "most of my grab rides involve a lot of idle chatter but one conversation left an indelible impression. this took place some time ago, back when uber was still around. i booked a ride to hougang around 7ish one morning and a lady driver accepted my booking.since it was the weekend, i was curious why she\u2019s already up and about so early, so i asked her. turns out she\u2019s a single mom and she drives an average of 12 to 15 hours a day (with little breaks in between) so she can make enough to raise her son. her mother cares for her boy when she\u2019s working, hence i am assuming she needs to cover her mother\u2019s expenses too. that\u2019s a huge responsibility to shoulder for one person.i told her that what she\u2019s doing is truly commendable, but she needs to take care of her health too. driving such long hours on the road is no joke. besides, fatigue can lead to accidents too. i also learnt that she tends to skip meals when she receives back-to-back bookings on a stretch.before i alighted, i told her that she might be able to make a small fortune if she persists at this rate, but the long-term health risks are hardly worth it. she should also spend more time with her kid before his childhood is forever lost in time.experiences like these remind me that every single driver has a story to tell, good or bad. some drive to pass time, some do it to get by, some do it to raise a family."

                "comment": "in economics, welfare is often measured by the surplus generated from a particular choice of distribution. for example, in a [classical demand-supply diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/economic-surpluses.svg/350px-economic-surpluses.svg.png), the welfare is the sum of two surpluses, and is maximized when the market clears (i.e., the favored bundle is at the red equilibrium point where the two curves cross). you can prove or see visually that if you deviate from that point, you generate inefficiency by consuming too little, or too much of something - [\"deadweight loss\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deadweight_loss).a situation like this - maximized total surplus - is what is known as *allocative efficiency*, where the maximum amount of benefit is achieved per resources you spend.a *pareto efficient* point is different. a pareto efficient point is one where no one party can be made better without making another party worse off. for example, if the economy has ten donuts and we both have five, i cannot make you better off without making me worse off.however, is pareto efficiency also allocatively efficient? let's say i value donuts at 1u each (5u) and you value donuts at 5u each (25u). then, by giving all 10 donuts to you, we increase the total surplus from 30u to 50u. we have obtained an *allocative* improvement by 20u, but only by hurting me by 5u. this happens to be a kaldor-hicks improvement because you can pay me 5+\u03f5, and i am now better off by \u03f5 while you are also better off by 25-\u03f5. we have gained both pareto and allocative improvements through a k-h transfer.---the reason i mentioned it is because the conclusion that competitive markets are efficient comes from the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics, which briefly states that 1) any walrasian (competitive) equilibrium is pareto efficient, and 2) any pareto efficient point can be accomplished with a combination of endowment redistribution and letting the free market take over. as we can see from the donut example, we had *a* pareto-efficient outcome (5 donuts each), but not necessarily an allocatively efficient outcome (10 donuts to you). in a sense, the price mechanism can fail to generate max efficiency - we didn't include prices, but you can introduce prices, endowment ~~and asymmetry~~ (not needed) to demonstrate this. not all improvements can be k-h improvements. this is a more general statement about price not guaranteeing efficiency, not directly targeted at the taxi market.---in general, any imperfection in the market generates allocative inefficiency. this includes monopoly power, barriers to entry (such as cost or regulations), information asymmetry (where one party knows more than another) and so on. the taxi market here demonstrates all of these factors, which is why the price mechanism can fail to bring about \"efficiency\".one might wonder why, at the beginning, i said that a classical demand-supply leads to efficiency while here, i said that the price mechanism can fail in doing that. the gist of it is that the models are different - when markets are imperfect, one party, either supplier or consumer, has an incentive to deviate from the perfect equilibrium. for example, if i have the power to slash quantity and raise prices, i might do so. you can see such an illustration [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/monopoly-surpluses.svg/326px-monopoly-surpluses.svg.png), where the allocatively efficient point is where blue crosses red. if i do so, i lose the revenue from the bottom yellow triangle, and gain the upper blue square, a net gain for me. the top yellow triangle represents the consumers who were cut out by the price raise; so yellow = total loss. if i were to force the firm to produce at qc on the x-axis, they are forced to sacrifice the top blue square and gain the bottom yellow triangle, but consumers gain the top blue square and the top yellow* triangle, erasing all allocative inefficiency - but at cost to the firm! the price mechanism has generated a pareto efficient point, but we show that allocative improvements can still be made.---the truth, of course, is that transport economics is much more complex than that. but the rule that pricing may be flawed in flawed markets holds. that is not to say that the taxi market is inefficient, simply that there exists a strong potential for it to be. to fix the above, for example, the firm may charge different prices to different people (price discrimination). such is the case for area-based pricing, or student pricing, for example. in this case, the inefficiency is alleviated because everyone gets to use the service, but the benefits are skewed towards the producer/taxi firm.  then it becomes not a problem of efficiency, but of \"fairness\", which is much more subjective.even now, though, you might be able to think of a number of examples of abusing things like student price (reselling, scalping, buying more than you need...), which can re-introduce inefficiency."

developed in 2015 by the then-infocomm development authority and the land transport authority - said it will cease operations on jan 1 2020.> advertisement> advertisement> beeline allows commuters to book private bus rides using a mobile app, with its routes determined by crowdsourced suggestions.> in 2017, the service reported having 130 routes and 19,000 monthly bookings.> \u201cthis decision will allow us to optimise our efforts and resources on developing products and services that can deliver benefits and convenience to more citizens,\u201d beeline said in a statement, adding that it had \u201csuccessfully served a number of singaporean commuters\u201d for four years.> it noted that beeline\u2019s code had been made open-source, to allow others to \u201ctake advantage of our codebase, building on it to create applications and platforms to help improve first-and-last mile connectivity in singapore\u2019s transport system.\u201d> advertisement> advertisement> separately ride-hailing giant grab is also ending operations for both grabshuttle and grabshuttle plus come january.> the two services differ in that grabshuttle - which is powered by beeline - operates on fixed-routes and timings.> meanwhile, grabshuttle plus - powered by canadian technology start-up rideco - offers dynamic bookings, similar to those of grab\u2019s ride-hailing offerings.> grabshuttle plus operates in areas such as punggol, sengkang, bedok, tampines and pasir ris, as well as routes to and from kranji camp ii and sungei gedong camp in the west.> these developments come after the lta ended a six-month trial of on-demand bus services in the joo koon and marina-downtown areas in june, citing the \u201chigh technology costs\u201d associated with offering such services.> redirecting of resources> in response to queries from cna, grab said the decision to discontinue the services \u2013 which it noted were introduced to meet the needs of a niche segment of riders \u2013 was unrelated to the shutting down of beeline.> > instead, it is aimed at allowing the firm to redirect its resources to \u201cfurther improving our core transport services to better serve our customers,\u201d said a spokesman for the singapore-based firm.> > grab declined to give ridership figures for either grabshuttle or grabshuttle plus, but noted its grabcoach service \u2013 which allows uses to charter buses for up to 40 people \u2013 will continue.> cna has contacted the government technology agency (govtech) for comment on beeline's decision to stop offering on demand buses.> > services like grabshuttle may not have been well-utilised and thus not financially viable for a private enterprise like grab, said singapore university of social sciences transport economist walter theseira.> he added that operating a successful transit service is difficult to do so profitably, noting it requires both reliable demand and customers who are willing to pay.> \u201con-demand services are (especially) hard because you need the demand to be just so. too little demand, they're better off taking taxis. too much demand, (there should just be) a regular bus service.\u201d> > not all doom and gloom for on-demand buses> on-demand bus services exist in various cities worldwide, with varying degrees of success.> kutsuplus, which began operating in helsinki in 2013, ended operations after two years as the authorities deemed it too costly.> and in january chariot, - which operated in various us cities and was owned by carmaker ford - announced it was closing shop.> however, local start-up swat - part of the goldbell engineering and transport group \u2013 says it still sees a future for on-demand bus services.> the firm has existing projects in singapore, australia, and vietnam, and is expected to begin operations in indonesia, the philippines, japan and china in the coming months.> > swat was one of two firms participating in the lta's on-demand bus trial, with the other being united states-based via.> > \u201cwith increasing congestion due to rapid urbanisation and infrastructure limitations, we believe that on-demand ride-pooling in buses is the way of the future,\u201d said swat chief executive and co-founder jarrold ong.> he added that such services can provide efficient public transport in areas where traditional fixed bus routes are not viable.> the most successful roll-outs have been in providing first-and-last mile connections to train, metro and trunk bus lines, he noted.> mr ong noted that while swat\u2019s primary focus is on working with governments to provide its services as part of public transport, as well as with companies for employee transport arrangements, it is also exploring other areas such as the use of autonomous vehicles.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "biting the bullet to go against the general sentiment of this thread... but like another poster mentioned, i believe we've got to understand the bigger picture of how grab is doing. for a long time now, they've been rolling out their food delivery subscription service (it used to be $8 for a $5 & $10 voucher + free 30 deliveries with no minimum cost; think it's now $10 for the same amount for vouchers, but 50 deliveries and $10 min cost - pardon me if i'm mistaken, gave up that habit of grabfooding a while back).i used to be some of those dudes who would order a $6 meal (i knew a friend who would order a $3.50 bubble teas) and get free delivery. since grab pays roughly $6 or more to its riders, and still has to pay the hawker/restaurant, you can imagine the loss they must have incurred during this period of time. i believe the main reason behind this move was to take away market share from the other food delivery services like foodpanda and deliveroo, by undercutting their profits (most likely taking a loss like what happened with uber).so #1 we learnt that grab's food delivery arm in the singapore context has probably been incurring losses. and #2 is even if food deliveries see a spike, we must be reminded that grab as a whole is doing poorly in this period of time. i've got a friend who's a driver there and boy, there are legit no passengers at all. and that means less profits for grab too, in the area in which they rely on most.in response to this, they've allowed drivers to too deliver food, which in turn increases the supply of people delivering food, and as you've mentioned... supply & demand. so yeah, i believe these wage reducing measures were already bound to happen, and the current covid crisis might have simply expedited the process. ps. not a grab staff. actually do not like grab (felt their price cutting measures were too mean for my lack of business acumen mind) as i used to ride for food panda but i thought an objective opinion should be shared. on a more important note - stay safe and sane, everyone!"

(short) orders that used to pay a minimum of 5 now pay about 4.5. (long) orders that used to pay ~6.5 now pay about 5.9/6. this multiplied by 12 and reduction of incentives ($10 for 12 deliveries) makes us lose about ~$20 a day from the changes. imagine working full time, this is significant (20*30 assuming working whole month at *minimum* orders is 600 dollars dip in earnings."

                "comment": "> it's not right for merchants to prioritize walk-in customers just because they're physically there.  from my experience working in service positions, i can tell u that i would be much more pressured to answer immediately to the angry and inpatient customer who is there in person, rather than the delivery guy who's sitting around scrolling his phone 90% of the time. it's really not a matter of right or wrong or principles; it is a very simple psychological effect. >customer decides to never order from the restaurant again. restaurant has lost a customer. right and you\u2019ve already answered your own question. it is very very unlikely that every single merchant faced by a food delivery guy will be so inefficient - because it will hurt their profits too. so your argument about next merchant being equally slow whatsoever, moot. ~~the problem is op\u2019s dad did not choose to cancel and move on when op explicitly mentioned that a number of other riders did - in that case, he made the choice to wait that 2.5hr, the \u201clost opportunity cost\u201d is his to bear. i also don\u2019t think any customer would actually want to wait 2.5hr for their lunch, even if it is from dtf. but idk, don\u2019t see op addressing this in his post.~~ edit: op has clarified that his dad was repeatedly given false assurances that the food would be out soon and all that, so i understand why he did not move on and stand corrected.secondly, is it not possible for the rider to just communicate the situation to the customer so that the order doesn\u2019t get recycled to the next rider? so that the customer can make alternative plans? if you, as a grab rider, cancel ur order and don\u2019t bother to communicate the situation to the unknowing customer then i think u r part of the problem. it is highly unlikely that the customer would insist on waiting 2.5hr for their lunch.thirdly, you\u2019re putting yourself into a false dilemma here. you always have a choice. i note that you mentioned the trade off for moving on to the next customer is \u201cwhat if the next merchant is slow ... will affect our incentives\u201d. like i said, it is not certain that the next merchant will be slow and secondly, it\u2019s not like there are procedural issues barring u from moving on to the next order. you can, perhaps at the risk of making less in terms of incentives. there\u2019s no either or situation here. and i don\u2019t take kindly to your implying that i\u2019m ignorant because (you assume) i haven\u2019t spoken to a grab rider before. this is a platform for people to speak their minds. we don't all need to be experts or delivery guys to comment on op's post."

(support local f&b, guyssss!)2. i have the option to tip the riders too- whyq: good for cbd but seems to be lacking in riders for other areas. long waiting time.- oodle: for more medium to high price restaurants. i use it for special occasions. pretty good experience for the few times i've used it."
