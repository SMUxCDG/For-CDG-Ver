                "comment": "Even if it costs exactly the same as a ICE car, it still makes sense to move towards an EV. In the long run EV also tend to have fewer maintenance costs due to fewer moving parts so they might save costs there. The replacing of batteries only add cost down the road and with most cars in Singapore only running for 10 years I doubt that's going to be a problem for the taxi companies. But at the end the point of the EV is still to reduce emissions rather than save costs immediately. Besides its not like as if the companies aren't getting massive rebates just for buying an EV rather than an ICE, by the government"

But one should apply that technique while in higher gears that will attenuate the jerkiness.\n\nFor Priuses, due to the electronic throttle and the unusual drivetrain setup (the electric motor, ICE and transmission are connected in such a way to vary the input/output into/from each seamlessly and steplessly), I suspect Toyota has figured out the most efficient engine running parameters for any particular load demand, so there's probably zero need for this technique."

Grab/Gojek/taxi always came out as cheaper, even if I factored in a perpetual surge pricing. What kills you is the additional: Parking, insurance, maintenance, etc. For no loss in convenience other than the wait while you try to get a car, it saves a ton.\n\nBeing married with kids and having drastically improved financial standing now, I\u2019m considering learning driving and buying a car now. Why, you might ask? Because having a car is more than a means of transport: It is a portable storage. The boot space. The car seats. The ability to fetch friends and family. I feel like this is something PHVs cannot give, so it\u2019s steering me towards getting a license and a car.\n\nThat said, I have had times before when I travelled abroad and regretted not having a license to rent a car. Driving overseas almost feels like a need, given how far things are and how pampered we\u2019ve been by Singapore\u2019s public transport system. Maybe get the license first. Car can talk later."

Treat it like \"how to ride a bike\" skill. Once you get it, you never forget it.\n\nI found it super useful when I went to Bay Area for biz trip. Public transport is basically nonexistent. And Uber costs a lot. Luckily my company partnered with a car dealer, so renting car was free. Hence, I just rented the car and made weekend trips to SF (from Sunnyvale) and went to lots of places for free (which could easily cost me 500$+ with Uber).\n\nYou also never know where you are going to retire. And learning it when you are older might be more challenging as you get more risk averse."

Getting around in many parts of US or Australia for example would be almost impossible without a car. So if you ever plan a trip to these places please go with people who can drive, but of course do contribute by navigating/keeping the drivers entertained on road trips!  \n\nAlso I personally just don\u2019t enjoy driving. I can get quite anxious and panicky so driving just makes me more stressed than anything else. I\u2019ve met many people who genuinely enjoy it though, and I think it makes so much more sense for such people to be on the road instead."

However, even then there are many places I would rather take public transport to. Parking is always a bitch. It helps that we're very small and our MRT network is getting more connected.\n\nDon't get a license because everyone around you is getting one. Our public transport network is fantastic, and in the time it takes for us to feel FOMO about getting a license and the time most of us can actually afford a car, we probably would have forgotten how to drive.\n\n(P.S Not that you asked, but even getting the cheapest motorcycle works out to be a few times more expensive than taking public transport in the long-run, but the catch is that you are at least cutting down your commute time by at least 50% on average so it's an *okay* trade.)"

Family/friends? Bad weather? Route unsuitable for public transport? Would it be as suitable to just call a Grab/taxi or rent a car in those (rare) scenarios instead?\n3. Is the time/convenience saved worthy of the sacrifices need to be made (financial/time/effort)? esp. with SG comprehensive public transport network, taxi/Grab, car sharing, BlueSG network etc.\n4. Do you currently/intend to have a job that requires a car? i.e. your car and required expenses can be classified as work expense\n5. Do your loved ones supportive of you owning a car and is willing to also support the expense of it (not just monetary)?\n6. Those phases of life that a car will be immensely more convenient like bringing a newborn around or parents for medical appointments \n7. Car rental overseas for convienence and/or road trips? \n8. Other relevant qns specific to your needs?\n\nAlso take your time to talk to those car owners and hear their perspective (I don't own a car), I myself have learnt plenty.

But there are hidden costs as well like petrol, insurance, repair costs etc. All of these add up can easily cost you 1.5k monthly\n\nBut this is where the problem lies in our society.

Now I'm married with two kids and there are always discussions with friends between owning a car and not. To me, I feel having a car improves your quality of life if you can afford and willing to throw into car ownership.\n\nImagine this, house mortgage loan, money for your parents, household expense, kids expenses, kids insurance premium, your own insurance, personal phone, broadband and u need even to finance a car loan, road tax, fuel, car insurance, maintenance. Maybe medical expenses as well.\n\nSo if you chose not to own a car when you are young and free, you probably won't start doing it after you move into your own house with kids.\n\nI started to own a car when young and I still own a car now with two kids. If I have financial difficulties in the future, the first thing to go will be the car. My current car is about 3.5 years old and have recently paid off its loan.\n\nWith the current Coe prices, the annual costs to own a car is about 18-19k (10k depreciation + the rest for fuel, insurance, road tax and maintenance).\n\nSo you might wanna think about it. Hope this helps! YOLO!"

But I digress, all in all, point is self driving vehicles shouldn't stop you  from getting a license and to my judgement I think it will take time before self driving cars are common.."

Allow me to explain if you will;\n\n They have to constantly communicate with air traffic control, be on a look out for weather, monitor vital systems of the aircraft and performance of the aircraft, be prepared and plan for emergency should it occur and also the amount of planning beforehand is crazy, the amount of stress in having to deal with so many factors, fuel (dependant on weather also), weight, weather planning (to avoid unfavorable weather areas), late passengers, the stress of the company breathing down your neck wanting you to depart on time to avoid extra delay fees etc, these are the stuff pax don't usually get to see haha\n\nAutopilot is not there to completely eliminate the workload. It's there to assist the flight crew by reducing  their huge amount of workload (e.g. figure things out any technical issues should they occur, while the plane flies by itself), hope you get the idea haha"

The car seat attaches to the frame by two clips and I can get the car seat installed within 20 seconds, it uses the seatbelts to hold the car seat in position. The frame itself collapses down easily and to a small size, we bought it in case we travelled as it can fit into carry on luggage. \n\nI\u2019ve never thought to myself that it\u2019d be easier buying a car vs taking a taxi, the ease to go in and out with the car seat is simple and isn\u2019t prohibitive to my lifestyle. My wife finds it easy to do as well which was the main thing. \n\nYou will need to bring your car seat with you wherever you go but your child can sit in the car seat itself for up to two hours. I found my son didn\u2019t like being in the bassinet and preferred being in the car seat in the stroller so make sour life easier\n\nGo to mother works at Great World City, they have a great range of strollers to check out."

You have to bring your own.\n\n**For the first 12 months, use a Doona:**\n\n[https://www.shopdoona.com/products/doona-car-seat-stroller](https://www.shopdoona.com/products/doona-car-seat-stroller)\n\nIt is a small pram that converts to a car seat and will protect the baby. After 12-16 months, your child will be too big to fit. Prices for this are all over the place. It can be between $300 to $700. Shop around online and maybe Carousell also. I suggest you buy the package with all the bag attachments.\n\n**Once your child is 3 years old,** you can get a seat belt harness that you can carry around. It folds up to a small package.[https://ridesafertravelvest.com/](https://ridesafertravelvest.com/)\n\n**After the Doona became too small**, my wife carried our baby on a strap/harness in her front and wrapped the cab seat belt around her lap.\n\nShe used this to carry the baby:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/88slba28cshdafc/PA070003%2B.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/88slba28cshdafc/PA070003%2B.jpg?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptrksm0z0m23sw3/\\_DSC0489%2B.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptrksm0z0m23sw3/_DSC0489%2B.jpg?dl=0)\n\nThe seat belt cross strap, pull it behind your shoulders, not across the baby/toddler. The waist strap slide it underneath the baby's backside. You HAVE to hold the baby's head unless your carrying strap has a head support.\n\nWe have a huge pram which allows the baby a lot of comfort, and can carry a lot of shopping, but the size is difficult to fold and put in a taxi by yourself. If you ask the taxi drivers, they all will help.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/79ptwva653v0vl3/\\_DSC0695%2B.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/79ptwva653v0vl3/_DSC0695%2B.jpg?dl=0)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/wgsun1y23kmqqk1/\\_DSC1445%2B.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wgsun1y23kmqqk1/_DSC1445%2B.jpg?dl=0)\n\nIf you have a small pram, it should not be a problem, but you won't be able to carry around your baby bag, essentials and any shopping you do. Big prams with a large under basket are inconvenient but they are extremely useful. If you don't have a car, you'll have to carry around everything. It's better to just chuck it under the pram and stroll everything around.\n\nSomething like this with a large basket.[https://sg.joiebaby.com/product/aeria/](https://sg.joiebaby.com/product/aeria/)\n\nThen put all your baby essentials, there.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**It's a lot to take in all at once.

                "comment": "You can get by with carrying your baby in a taxi but it's not the safest. The best is having a child seat. How necessary a child seat is depends on your view on the likelihood of getting into a car accident and whether you want to risk it. I personally think taxis should also require child seats but that's just my opinion. Also, what if you have more than 1 kid that requires a child seat? Note that not many cars can adequately fit 2 child seats. I am considering changing to a bigger car as my wife is due again at the end of the year.\n\nLike many other comments, they're comparing cost vs convenience but I think the convenience factor is not discussed enough here. I'm usually driving while my wife sometimes sits behind with my 1 yo or sometimes sits in the front passenger seat. With the child seat, you have that flexibility. Your wife will also have flexibility in what she can do even if she's at the back with your kid. Playing with him at the back is much easier when you're not worrying if he'll struggle out of your grip. \n\nYour kid is also likely to make a mess in the car. Could be puke, could be poop. We've spent a lot of time cleaning the child seat and the car in car parks. It may not happen to all kids, but you'll never know until your kid arrives. For reference, I think my kid's incidence rate is probably 1/10 trips. It used to be huge poop explosions, but now that he's older and on solids, it's more of merlion. Whatever it is, you'll spend at least 10-20 mins cleaning everything and changing him. Having your own car makes all of that easier since you're not going to have to worry about compensation to the grab/taxi driver AND you get to change your kid in your car boot. \n\nRemember that your own car is your own mini private space. You can also feed him in there and take short naps (if it's not under the sun and well ventilated). Again, this depends on how manageable your kid is and how long you intend to stay outside with your kid. Having a car gives you the freedom to make any choice without having to think too much about consequences. Not sure if you want to go out for an entire day? Pack a full day's bag of baby supplies in the car while only carrying the diaper bag with enough supplies for a few hours. If you run out, just go to your car and get extra. \n\nOwning a car will also greatly improve your family's quality of life. It's expensive but some of us find that extra money is worth the additional privacy and freedom. I think you need to look at your own financial situation and determine if you're able to afford this 'luxury' in SG. My personal recommendation is that if you can afford it, absolutely do so because it gets rid of a lot of headache for your entire family. If you're going to struggle to afford it, don't. You're just changing the type of headache. If you can barely afford it, then I guess it's up to your priorities for your kid's early childhood. I know there will be some parents who rather save that money to bring their kids on holidays or buy other stuff. \n\nWhatever it is, congratulations on becoming a parent! Good luck!"

So it was really a no Brainer for us. \n\nOver the last two years, getting a can has become far more easier. Yes, the monopoly of one player socks with price increasing which is why we do our calculations every 3 months to see if we are breaking even of spend via cab to that of owning a car. When we reach that point, we will definitely buy a car. Hoping we never get there. \n\nMy suggestion to you is to forecast your expenses and take a realistic look at it. What you can afford vs what level of comfort you really need. And then take a call. \n\nWishing you loads of happiness and ofcourse a lot of sleepless nights!"

It\u2019s not just about the car seat bro, car seat is but one of the warehouse of supplies you have to lug around when bringing out a baby or toddler.

And also add the weight of the baby too lol. \n\nI managed one 99% baby ok without a car, but honestly my knees and back did not do so well during the 3-4 years. So unless you have strong joints and muscles, I don\u2019t recommend 2-3 babies in a row without a car lol. \n\nFor those taking buses and MRT, I can tell you that on average, people are kinder and more patient with western mums with strollers... I was yelled at by a bus driver, but the western mum who did the same thing at the next stop didn\u2019t get yelled at. It\u2019s rare I know, but a silver taxi driver scolded me for loading the stroller in the boot too slowly. I really did my best and was out of breath. \n\nWe finally caved and got a used car at age 4 \u2014 we get car sick if we are stuck in school bus traffic around the school gate with masks on. And waiting outside the school gates (parents not allowed inside waiting lounge during covid ) , sometimes in hot ditches outside small Pre-school gates means... heat stroke !"

Idk if taxi that happened to overtake the bus hit me or if i got shocked and tripped backwards\n\nThe next min my knees elbows and toes were bleeding and my head was spinning. Taxi uncle was clearly flustered and a nice lady asked me for my mom phone number\n\nI was scared my mom will scold me so I  said nvm I will walk home cuz it was 2 min away. Lady convinced the 11y/o i will go home(cuz I was clearly not in a sane state of mind). Called my mom and ambo. Took me to kk. \n\nLuckily went hospital cuz turned out I had hit my head so hard my brain hit my skull. Had internal bleeding and NSFW warning: vomited blood, nose bleed and ear bleed. My mom fainted when she saw that while i was like \"damn that is so cool\". \n\nWas in high dependency for 3 days. Dr said can stay somemore but i macho so i rested over the weekend. For the next 6 months, i had to take the lift and couldnt do strenuous exercise like PE cuz Dr. wanted my brain to recover from the shock.\n\nThe whole time i was more worried abt hospital bill and my parents' reactions and i cried and told them i will pay them. They were like wtf, girl u just got low key brain damage and u r worried abt us!! I mean for the next 5 years, that was my family's emotional attack against me haha(not in a toxic way, in a joking, tough love way) but after Os I got a job and offered to pay them back. They didn't take the money but since I had offered the financial cost of my mistake, they actually stopped constantly bugging me abt it.\n\n\nLesson of the day for me was: you wanna do smtg wrong, do it properly. . Cuz after that day, i continued to Jay walk(yea I know, i almost killed myself and ended a taxi driver's career) but was much much more careful. Taxi driver was rly nice enuf to not scold me or take any legal action even tho there was a small bump on his taxi and i oso obv didn't report him to TP(altho had to make statement and admitted it was my fault, idk what was the penalty or if there was but yea....I guess i have a TP case?)\n\nTill this day, if i ever wanna die, i think back to that day. I had almost died but didnt  so obv smtg in the universe or whatever philosophical BS will not allow me to die so yea..."

The first few HDBs had great views of the sea/river. Maybe at that point still cannot really appreciate, but in these Covid times when everywhere is crowded and you just want to get away, old Punggol is almost idyllic. Used to go there during my school days to play with my friends.\n\nI'm doing this recce of Punggol before I write it off as too many HDBs situated close together, far from the city, and lacking of personality."

At least when I use Deliveroo or Foodpanda from a consumer's POV, a delivery status usually goes from \"The restaurant is preparing you food. A rider will pick it up once it is ready\".\n\nTherefore, it seems like this 'picking up' of order seems to already be done via the app. This is my guess.\n\nAlso, picking up orders physically will be chaotic! Unlike a taxi ride, the 'passenger', in this case a pack of food, won't tell you where it wants to go. You likely have to validate the destination somewhat, with the closest technology I can think of being scanning a QR code on a receipt on the food package. Otherwise, restaurants will need some sort of display that allows riders to check in and pick up any available orders? Kinda like a bounty board.\n\nThat's sad news to those orders that are out of the way and deemed as bad ROI for the distance to travel, and be left out cold with nobody wanting to pick it up.\n\nThis is before we even talk about angry riders fighting one another for a good parcel.\n\nJust my 2 cents \ud83d\ude19 open for opinions."

There are many other expenses such as road tax, insurance, COE renewal etc etc. Drivers are also so rude on the roads (due to the high levels of stress here), I've met many who have a complete disregard for other's safety or just want to take out their anger on you. We're such a tiny country, we cant have everyone owning cars. Public transport is pretty good, taxi, grab, gojek are very reliable and affordable.

Depending on the engine size that will cost you around $55000 for a 10 year certificate. It would be easier to purchase a car here. Budget at least $1500 a month for a very basic car and petrol, ERP. So it depends on your income level. If you buy a car, you need to put 30% down. Have a look at car prices on SGcarmart and do the math. \n\nA car is not necessary, but is handy. Taxi's and ride share are very plentiful but can be difficult to get one when it is raining, or during peak periods."

Grab rides and taxis are cheap and plentiful. I've done the calculations and it really is cheaper to take 2-3 taxi rides per day than pay for a car and all the associated expenses. \n\nThe only thing I haven't seen addressed in the comments are car seats. From a quick internet search, you can book a [Grab Family](https://i.imgur.com/IkKw2Z8.jpg) ride (at a higher rate) and they will provide a car seat or booster suitable for children above 1 year old. Taxis are not required to provide any child restraints beyond seat belts and regular Grab rides aren't supposed to accept children less than 1.35 meters tall. So, you will have to hold your baby in your arms or drag your own car seat with you while you shop, dine out, etc. I don't have young children, so I'm hoping someone with more experience can jump in to offer further insight."

You also dont need to. \n\nI import like small quantity like 5.. for new products, not food related. The I'll bring in like 6 different one. The most basic colours. Then slowly try. \n\n5 is a good number to test the market. Then I just take good quality photos and post on carousell, and those ecommerce site. Then I wait. Usually takes 3 weeks to pick up. So dont procrastinate..\n\nBefore you buy, check for other sellers also on shopee and lazada too. Make sure you're making a good enough margin.. I wont elaborate too much on what I sell, but people need to buy 5 to 10 pieces each order. Each peice I only make 1 dollar to 4 dollars. Any higher the margin. Someone will undercut. \n\nSo my point being, sell something that people might need more than 1 or 2. That way packing the items makes it worth while for the effort. \n\nDont overthink. 5 items. What's popular. Just start by bringing in 3 things in your shop. Wont take more then 3 hours. Dont invest in anything until you really start getting popular. \n\nTill this day I still go down my block to take clean cardboard and make my own boxes for my products. Just keep it minimal. \n\nBeing a cleaner is really hard work and itll break my heart. Personally I believe it's a big big world out there. There are HUGEEEEE possibilities. Your dad deserves the chance, think out of the box. Try something. Maybe drop shipping works for you! Who knows! \n\nIf you take my humble advise. Please ping me your shop name. I'll be sure to support your dad for the first order. Press on!!! I wish you all the best!"

Once again depends on which company you are at. Some companies have their own canteen. Some have transport to the food centre on the island (Oasis). Most times people just drive there or drive out.\n\n4. Get ready to pay advance booking fees of $8 if you intend to have a taxi pick you up from inside the island. Oh and don't get stuck at the checkpoint and miss your company bus (you have to disembark and clear the checkpoint like customs lol but far less crowded and much simpler)."

Jurong island itself is very big, could take some time to reach your destination depending how far in it is.\n\n2. There are bus 715, 716, 718 going to different area of JI. Charges $2.50 each trip. They go to and from bus stop next to Westgate, you could google Jurong island bus.\n\n3. I only knew there\u2019s a public canteen at Sakra Oasis. There\u2019s a Starbucks and Indian restaurant next to it too.\n\n4. Public transport is a challenge in JI, frequency is every 30min and it doesn\u2019t cover 11am-4pm I think. Try not to be late and missed your company bus. There\u2019s no problem into JI with taxi because there\u2019s a taxi lane at gantry for them to change temporary pass. Coming out will be difficult if there\u2019s no taxi in JI, like after 3pm when very few people going in."

Comfort\u2019s fixed rate has been cheaper than Grab\u2019s the last few times I checked. I do have a \u201cregular\u201d taxi driver that I make advance bookings with, but that\u2019s because he\u2019s helpful and reliable. I sometimes have to move quite a bit of stuff for work, and he\u2019ll help me load it up in the trunk.\n\nHowever the average taxi driver on the street tends to be a lot less helpful than the average Grab driver, perhaps due to the lack of a ratings system. At the airport if you observe the taxis waiting for passengers, most of the drivers don\u2019t even bother to get out to see if they can help a little. Basically I\u2019ll get a taxi over a grab sometimes, but only if it\u2019s cheaper or my regular driver is available. \n\n2. I think driving taxis might be a little more \u201cstable\u201d, in the sense that drivers can always queue for passengers at malls or hospitals if there aren\u2019t any booking. They can also get bookings via their respective company\u2019s app as well as Just Grab. If business is really bad, my impression (not sure how true this is) is that they can give up driving a taxi more easily than giving up a private hire car rental or selling their private vehicle purchased for the purpose of being a PHD. \n\n3. See (1). I usually just compare between Grab and Comfort, and resort to the rest only if I\u2019m not able to get a ride on either of these 2 apps. But in such a situation, price isn\u2019t as much of a concern as getting a ride."

I'm an exception as I was looking for a regular driver for quite a while already (in the SG Hitch Telegram group) so he's ok with my price of $8 per trip (equates to $160/$200 a month which is reasonable). Others are his regular passengers who he picks up on a regular basis and yes he's able to commit to my schedule. If the timing I end class change (have to stay back to practice for practical exam, etc) then I'll let him know an hour in advance what time to pick me up."

The most memorable one was from secondary school which went \"Eh careful, dont make him angry or his father Osama will come and make the school kebabom\".\n\nThen there was my workplace which I of course I will keep confidential that, after about 6 months of working there admitted to me that they initially did not want to hire because of my arabic name. They explained that me being arabic implied that my command of English would be poor and thus not suited to an English teaching role. They also gave me a western name without my consent and introduced me to my student's parents with this name. Needless to say I left shortly after. \n\nThen there's the dating. *Dear god.*\n\nGood times, sometimes its funny but I gotta admit it made me wish i was chinese at one point.

Met a few patriotic malays.\n\nSomehow i accidentally dug deep into the web and found some guys who are really motivated and proud just because they are malay.\n\nI've seen on youtube, videos on how the malays were a ancient race and we were voyagers and warriors bla bla bla. Not going to lie, this boosted my ego a bit for a while until i realised it was stupid. \n\nThen i saw facebook pages where some malays went \"wah all these chinese people want to take over\", then so many things against Chinese people. \n\nI then saw a thread where a guy said that his sergeant or officer said to him \"don't forget it was the malays (leftenan adnan incident) who fought off the japanese on the hill\". \n\nWhen i was eating with a relative, i saw a white guy and i said \"these white guys are huge\", commenting on their bodies and generally they actually are huge..He then went on about how \"they are actually nothing ok, they're just strong only, u know which prophet is our ancestor?\" to which i kept silent. \n\nDuring the black lives matter incident, this guy \"naseeha sessions\" posted a video lecture on islamic view on racism. Apparently in Islam, it is 100% haram to be proud of your tribe, race, group etc. Allah created us all in different races so that we could all recognize each other because if we were all one race, a bit hard to recognize who is who (example). \n\nThen another ustaz, he said \"on the day of judgement, Allah will not ask if youre malay, chinese or indian. All that matters is the deeds you did during your time on earth\". \n\nIt just turned me 360\u00b0 and now i find racism really stupid but sadly it's still very rampant in the world. Being proud of your lineage doesn't make sense if you're not doing anything amazing to benefit others anyways. Always stay humble and remember that no matter how good you are, there are others who are better"

The Malay guy worked in a different dept, had a much higher level of education (Masters degree) and his job scope was 90% operational and 75% high risk. He was also senior management in that dept and was required to go offshore once every few weeks. The Chinese guy however, was merely an office manager with the responsibility of running the office and managing admin staff.  Two completely different skillsets, and he still had the gall to be racist about a Malay man driving a better car than him.\n\nEdit : this happened about 10 years ago so quite recent, both men would be in their mid to late 40s by now."

I remember 2-3 boys in particular in lower Primary who didn\u2019t let me join their group because I was \u2018different\u2019.\n\nIn secondary school when the social media craze started I had video proof during a school trip a group of boys were targeting me and making fun of me during a school trip (calling me things like \u2018Bangla gundu\u2019, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and hilariously, \u2018Afghanistan\u2019 (????)) and would shout \u2018Wakanda forever\u2019 whenever around me. One of the boys said that my girlfriend \u2018confirm got curtain\u2019 \n\nJC was much better, tho my CCA teacher couldn\u2019t seem to get over my race and every joke he made seemed race related (\u2018you do this your mother at home will make nice Bangladeshi meal for you\u2019). \n\nNS was funny because by the time I went into NS I didn\u2019t actually \u2018look\u2019 Bangladeshi anymore because my skin lightened and I grew taller than the average Migrant Worker - from the outside observer I looked more Malay. I because an Admin in SCDF where like 80% are Malay and people would randomly start speaking Malay to me. When I told my Encik I\u2019m actually Bangladeshi he switched accent (???) and started speaking to be in a Tamil accent???? Oh, and the calling me \u2018Bangla\u2019 instead of my name continues lol\n\nThere are also people who genuinely don\u2019t get it. Some people asked me why I can\u2019t speak Tamil myself and I tell them I\u2019m not Indian I\u2019m Bangladeshi and then they ask \u2018what\u2019s the difference?\u2019.

As I look more Chinese than Malay, a lot of people think that I'm Chinese instead of being mixed.

When working with them, everyone spoke in English almost 98% of the time. I also always send 2 resume (one with my alias and another with my Malay birth name) as part of a mini experiment to prove my point, and I always get called back with the person calling me by my alias name.\n\nIt does upset me as there have been cases where my Malay birth name on my certs have hindered me from getting jobs that I want. Sadly, the industry that I'm in is heavily dominated by the Chinese, Koreans and Americans. \n\nI have decided to change my name next year before I graduate so that my alias will be reflected on my university certificate. I feel bad for even having thoughts about changing my name just for the purpose of advancing my career and so that more companies would be inclined to hire me. I have never and will never be ashamed of my birth name that was given to me by my parents, but I do want to advance my career."

Just to name a few. \n\nBeen denied job offers or of I were to be hired, I'd only be able to work in the back. This was when I wanted to apply for a banquet job with my friend. When I was told this I looked for a job somewhere else.\n\nI'm not particularly athletic, and running wasn't and still isn't my strong suit. And during NS I'd get comments like \"I thought Indians were supposed to be fast\" and that kind of stuff. \n\nAlthough I was able to use that in my favour in NS and got way better cookhouse food compared to the rest of my section. \n\nWhen I was training to be a sergeant I has paired up with a racist Chinese guy. He'd constantly make comments like \"Eh why you so dirty\" and like \"Way you smell like curry\" bear in mind we're in the same camp and we ate the same food, so there really wasn't any curry. He'd \"pretend\" to speak Tamil to me when in reality it was gibberish and he thought it was the funniest thing. Eventually I managed to win him over and I found out he never had non-chinese friends and he didn't think what he was doing was racist.  \n\nWhen I was in JC, I had a large friend group of mostly Chinese people. I'd come to find out that this one Chinese girl would be kind of distant and wouldn't really hang out together. It wasn't until much later that I found out that she didn't hang out in the group if I was there. The thing is, I haven't really interacted with this girl. And I was wracking my brain to figure out if I had been offensive to her. I confided in my close friend who was also rather close with this friend and then she told me that the girl just didn't like Indians. \n\n\nAnd I was baffled. Like this was in the 2010s... But I was like weird but I don't know what the story was... Maybe something happened with someone who was Indian. I don't know her trauma. But no, there wasn't really an explanation. Eventually I started speaking to her more and getting to know her better. And she hit me with the \"You're one of the good ones\". She hadn't had an Indian friend before and apparently her parents were really racist. She kinda grew out of it and we became good friends. \n\nI moved to Australia and here's the funny thing, I haven't experienced such racism here. Sure I get the odd comment where white folks ask \"Where are you from?\" And when I reply with Singapore it seems like they change their tune entirely and praise Singapore saying how they love it and such. \n\n\nAlso if I had an Indian friend who was a girl, it was automatically assumed that we were dating, when in actual fact I'd have been with my girlfriend who not Indian but people automatically assume that the two similar coloured people were dating."

In 2010, \n\nChinese earn $7326 \nMalays earn $4575\nIndians earn $7664\nIf you notice also, the difference in the \u201cothers\u201d income in 2000 possibly indicated a Euro-centric Singapore where we think other races are more capable in their job scope than our own selves. \n\nThe stark disparity in the household income indicates a deeply-seated issue in Singapore\u2019s racial equality. Income is an indicator on one\u2019s own capability because of the sheer hard work to achieve certain positions in the labour work force. If Malays are earning lesser then the other races, it may point towards their unlikely potential to be successful in their job/career. \n\nAs a Chinese JC at student, I have made the conscious effort to be more racially inclusive (not limiting my friends to a certain race). Thankfully, I was in a non-Chinese dominated secondary school around Malcom Road (hmm) and I had the opportunity to interact with many different races. However, I noticed that as I reached JC, oh man the number of Malays really start to dwindle. I am not trying to stereotype, but i can count the number of Malays in my school with my the fingers on my hands. Fortunately, most of my friends are actually indians, because they are more genuine in their interactions with me. \n\nIn SAF, the issue of racism is worse man. Currently serving my national service, and my indian officer friends told me that during their training school, all the instructors were actually  racist. Some of them even said, \u201ci thougjt indians should run faster because they burn their leg during the thaipusasam festival\u201d Honestly that is just bloody rude and it perpetuates racism more in Singapore. Idk man, i think that more can be done with changing the mindset of Singaporean\u2019s, especially Chinese people, to be more accepting that Chinese are not the[Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore) only people living in singapore"

We don't have group of people openly hating on another race, but every local minority has definitely experienced some form of racism. We also need to consider that much of Singapore's racism is institutionalised racism i.e. indirectly or directly supported by the community and gahmen.\n\nWith that, here's the ones I' ve heard of and experienced:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\"All Malays go to ITE.\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eCannot see (Indian/Malay friend) in the dark\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\"Chinese/Indian people smell bad\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\"Yellow skin\" towards the Chinese\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\"Malays only know how to play guitar at the void deck\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\"Don't play with the Malays/Indians at the void deck.\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eMassive lack of minority representation in the media\n\n\u25aa\ufe0e\"Malays are bad at math\"\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eName-calling - a__ neh neh, ang moh (means \"red devil\" apparently)\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eMandarin being spoken when there are non-Mandarin speakers. I've had English teachers explain certain concepts and jokes in Mandarin, and groupmates speaking to one another in Mandarin when I speak zero Mandarin. I've had one gutsy classmate mock me calling him out by saying \"Learn Mandarin lah!\". To which I respond to him with \"Learn your national language.\"\n\nHonestly, racism in Singapore has decreased slightly, but in a society where elders are the rule, historically racist stereotypes are passed down and encouraged, together with elitism thanks to huge economic gaps between local Chinese and local minorities. There also how many Singaporeans don't like being called out for being insensitive or racist - they will accuse others of being snowflakes or how \"it is just a joke\". Racism here is fairly normalised as well, and this is not including the negativity towards foreign workers and international students for \"stealing jobs\"."

When we see someone who is close to us in relations or attributes, we tend to follow in their footsteps because we want to \"belong\". I'm sure there's a whole explanation to this but I'm just cutting this short.\n\nI'm a malay myself but i don't follow anything stupid. I hang around guys who go the mosque, never smoked in my life, never drank and never stayed up late under the void deck to hang in a group to game. Never liked to play mobile legends nor follow social media trends. But of course I'm taught to be nice to others and I've learned a lot from talking with these \"matrep boys\" that we stereotype.

Like I'm a dude that buys fragrant soaps and lotion, all in an attempt to not smell. If I have to leave the house I have to shower. No questions about it. \n\nMeanwhile I had this friend in Secondary school who had a body odour problem but no one seemed to care or point it out. It sometimes felt like I was the only one who was able to smell him. And it was rancid. And since no one pointed it out he never changed it. Halfway through the year, after we had PE, I offered him my deodorant and I swear he looked as if he had never seen it before. We were like 14~15. He started using it and his B.O. wasn't an issue anymore. But it was so strange to me cos I had learnt about deodorant when I was 11 years old in primary school. And this guy literally had no one tell him he smelled or he had to use deodorant. \n\nI've encountered 5 before. Because people couldn't fathom that I'm just Indian from the way I spoke. Because to them I didn't sound Singaporean (didn't use singlish) nor did I sound Indian (Indian accent), even though I looked indian... and they did the where are your parents from, grandparents from, and I'd say Singapore and they just wouldn't believe it... \n\nNumber 11... Had that from my own uncles and aunts saying that I should settle down with a nice Indian girl whenever they'd ask if I had a girlfriend and I'd say whoever I was dating. My parents, thankfully, are not like this, and I'm able to introduce to them whomever I was dating regardless of race. But number 11 was hard cos I had to steer away from dating Singaporean Chinese girls."

I would like to share some thoughts of my own.\n\nFor the JC argument, I posit to my friends this possibility. If you look at the top 10, 20, or even 30 secondary schools which produce a large proportion of students who end up in JC (high O level scores), would you find that a significant proportion of these schools are SAP schools? If so, would it be logical to conclude that because of this (large number of SAP schools in the top X number of secondary schools), the racial mix of students eventually making to JC would be overwhelmingly Chinese? \n\nWe're living in a society where \"every school is a good school\" and everyone is supposedly able to pursue academic success if he/she works hard. This I can agree with, to some extent. But if a school's teaching and instruction are already producing top top students (such as SAP schools) and the students from these schools are mainly C instead of MIO, how else can the MIO students be given access to such high levels of teaching and instruction, that can be enablers for them to also enter JC? Must they be forced to study Chinese as a language just to be given the chance to study in a SAP school and subsequently stand a better chance of entering JC? Access to **secular** education should not have barriers that are based on one's ethnic background, whether loosely or rigidly.\n\nCaveat - My arguments may be flawed as I am human after all. I do welcome corrections if there is flawed logic in my reasoning."

I did have a very pure Chinese name as well but my parents legally removed it when I was younger so the only existence it has is on my birth certificate. \n\nHaving both a Malay and Chinese name could work. But having 2 names also confused many of my friends and relatives. So my parents decided to remove my Chinese name so as to not confuse people, keep it simple, and because I didn't resonate with it.\n\nMy name is also pretty common and there will always be another Malay girl with the same name as mine. So I've been using my alias for a pretty long time and I'm planning to legally change my name to that. It's not a very Malay or Chinese sounding name, it's right in the middle and people can tell that I'm mixed just by hearing my alias name.\n\nMy parents did make an effort to ensure that I do know both Malay and Chinese as I've been taught from young that it'll make my life easier. Never really understood what they meant till I started looking for jobs and got rejected left and right just because of my pure Malay name no matter how hard I worked or scored well."

But at the same time, I feel like I'm not allowed to feel frustrated about it as my problem does have a solution at the end of the day.\n\nI have to choose between adhering to what society wants me to be (altering my identity), or go against it (being myself) but at the expense of my future and rice bowl. And as much as I want social justice, I feel like my future and rice bowl is way too important for me to be gambling over going with or against what society wants me to be."

When we see someone doing wrong, we don't hate the person nor his race, but only hate his actions. I've worked in the customer service sector so i think I've a say in this. Everyone has their own individuality, characteristics and attitude. But sometimes they are stereotyped a certain way because of how they were brought up collectively. Indian nationals (the more wealthy ones) are more demanding when it comes to customer service because of what they get in their country. Sometimes it's a universal thing with wealthy people. \n\nI'm very very sure if you struck a conversation with these people, they will be genuine, nice and will help another person out when given the chance, but they were brought up in a different environment than us so that's what makes them have this certain stereotype of something like \"cockiness or arrogance\". Everyone surely has mistakes, and we should be patient in correcting them.\n\nAnd no, I didn't bring up the point about how local indians are nicer than indian nationals. I had a indian national manager and he was the nicest person in the workplace. I don't care who you are, as long as you're nice to me, I'm nice to you"

Usually covers souse and children as well. \n\nTakeaways- for one person a steak, curry, pizza etc usually between $20-30 a time\n\nGroceries for 2- really depends what you eat. I probably stop off at the supermarket twice a week and spend about $75 a time. Beer, bacon, sausages, cheese, hand etc are quite expensive and usually start around $10 each, beer starts at about $15/4 pack, bottle of cheap wine starts around $25\n\nGym memberships - in the city prob closer to $100 month, out of town about $60 month\n\nTaxis- depend on time of day, if your lucky a 5 min ride not peak hour could be $8, a 15 min ride during peak times could be $30+ \n\nMRT/bus- depends how far but never usually more than $2\n\nSide note: Marina Bay and Orchard are overrated. If you\u2019re willing to go 15 min drive out of the city on ECP/AYE in either direction you\u2019ll get twice the space or pay half the cost."

Groceries from cheap supermarkets like Sheng shiong can be around 300-400sgd per month but usually expats go to Cold Storage or Marketplace and it\u2019s much more expensive. A decent 3-4 room condo in downtown be around 4-5k sgd, car (mpv or suv) anywhere from 150k to 350k depending on brand, usually 3-5k sgd per month including insurance/taxes/petrol, also greatly depends on if new car or not. If using public transport, way way cheaper. \n\nUr budget of 16k is way more than enough to cover basic living expenses considering our median wage is around 4-5k, but if u wanna enjoy in Singapore it\u2019s a different story"

Since it's time based, the cost savings are the most obvious when 1) the route is long and 2) there's highway with little traffic to your destination. For instance, from my place in the west to sengkang is at least $20 on grab, but because I can take multiple highways to sengkang the total driving time is <30mins, making it about $10. The other day I drove from my place to funan (there's a station there) in early morning without traffic. Grab was $13 while bluesg was about $7. If you're in peak hour traffic you're probably better off taking grab, not just because the $ will be similar but you also save on your frustration lol"

                "comment": "I would discourage using bluesg, especially for new drivers. Yes, it is cheap if all goes well, but if it doesn't there is a huge headache.\n\nThe whole per minute charging concept for bluesg means you are going to be rush from point A to B. This makes for dangerous driving especially if you are new to the roads. What if you just got on the expressway to find out that 5 mins ago there was an accident and the jam is now 1km long taking half an hour to clear? Will you be frantically changing lanes just to get ahead?\n\nFurthermore, the cars are tall and light. While I don't see any reports about the car falling over, speeds above 70 got me feeling like the car can topple with just a flick of the steering wheel. The whole driving feel was very much like a taller go-kart with slightly more power.\n\nDrawbacks aside, there are some positives.\n\nThe car is immensely light and agile, so it is quite fun to drive between traffic lights. Floor the pedal from a stop, and stomp the brakes to a stop. You can do it safely because it has high low-end torque and tops out quite fast meaning you can't go fast anyway.\n\nYou're slightly higher up than other drivers, which gives you a slightly better view.\n\nIt's electric, and totally silent. Helps save the earth yada yada.\n\nAnd of course being in your own cocoon, you can shout along to songs on the radio/dig your nose etc\n\nDisclaimer: I don't know how to turn on the aircon in bluesg cars. So learn how to turn on their aircon if you drive bluesg cars."

There's a couple of tourist attractions on Sentosa itself(e.g.Luge+Skyride), as well as a couple of beaches you can relax and play in.\n\nOther locations you may want to visit:\n\n- Gardens by the Bay (Bayfront MRT)\n- River Safari / Night Safari / Zoo (You can travel by taxi/uber or bus)\n\nWe have parks and other naturey stuff too, if you don't want to pay for it you can consider:\n\n-Sungei Buloh Wetlands(this is really far from town), MacRitchie Reservoir, \n- Hort Park / Henderson waves bridge that you can hike/walk til Mount Faber and take a cable car that brings you to sentosa and back. This is near Telok Blangah MRT. Or you can take a bus from Harbourfront MRT.\n\nFor city sights you can visit Marina Bay to see the skyline or simply just spend it in Orchard Road for shopping.\n\nFor drinks and night life you can visit Clarke Quay.\n\nIt really depends on what you want to see and experience though. Personally I feel Sentosa has a lot to offer for family fun. :)"

I only speak English and have rarely had issues communicating in S'pore. \n\nDepending on what you and your family enjoy, these would be my recommendations of what to visit:\n\n* Gardens by the Bay\n* Sentosa Island (Universal Studios, awesome aquarium (expensive though))\n* Tiong Bahru - historic and hip neighbourhood, purposely not built up (all buildings capped at 3 storeys), best bakery, good cafes and cute shops (http://www.visitsingapore.com/walking-tour/culture/in-the-neighbourhood-tiong-bahru/)\n* Chinatown\n* Arab Quarter - pretty + can buy cheap pashminas here (expensive in NZ where I'm from)\n* Haji Lane - trendy and hip street, near to Arab Quarter\n* Night Safari\n* River Safari zoo - pandas!\n* Botanical Gardens\n* Singapore Museum\n* Peranakan Museum - showcases the history and culture of the Peranakan people. In a beautiful historic building and has a stunning collection of furniture, clothes, etc. (http://peranakanmuseum.org.sg/)\n* Eat at a hawker centre/visit Lau Pa Sat (http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/architecture/historical/lau-pa-sat/)\n* Singapore Art Museum (SAM) - always has great exhibitions and based in a beautiful colonial building\n* Gardens by the Bay - never seen anything like it before, also amazing greenhouses.\n* Marina Bay Sands - right next to Gardens by the Bay, there used to be a daily projected light show outside the mall/hotel. Worth seeing if it's still running.\n* For good views of the city - Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, ION on Orchard (free viewing deck)\n\nFor cheap meals, I would always try to eat at a hawker centre. Cafes, restaurants, and even food courts in malls can be expensive (or at least more expensive than hawker centres).\n\nThe MRT is very easy to use and everything is in English. I've always found taxis easy to come by and relatively cost-effective. \n\nHave a great time in Singapore!"
