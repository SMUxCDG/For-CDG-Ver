Family wasn\u2019t doing well so I couldn\u2019t afford lessons, and couldn\u2019t take the test.\n\nDone lots of price comparisons between owning a car and taking grab every day. Grab/Gojek/taxi always came out as cheaper, even if I factored in a perpetual surge pricing. What kills you is the additional: Parking, insurance, maintenance, etc. For no loss in convenience other than the wait while you try to get a car, it saves a ton.\n\nBeing married with kids and having drastically improved financial standing now, I\u2019m considering learning driving and buying a car now. Why, you might ask? Because having a car is more than a means of transport: It is a portable storage. The boot space. The car seats. The ability to fetch friends and family. I feel like this is something PHVs cannot give, so it\u2019s steering me towards getting a license and a car.\n\nThat said, I have had times before when I travelled abroad and regretted not having a license to rent a car. Driving overseas almost feels like a need, given how far things are and how pampered we\u2019ve been by Singapore\u2019s public transport system. Maybe get the license first. Car can talk later."

Treat it like \"how to ride a bike\" skill. Once you get it, you never forget it.\n\nI found it super useful when I went to Bay Area for biz trip. Public transport is basically nonexistent. And Uber costs a lot. Luckily my company partnered with a car dealer, so renting car was free. Hence, I just rented the car and made weekend trips to SF (from Sunnyvale) and went to lots of places for free (which could easily cost me 500$+ with Uber).\n\nYou also never know where you are going to retire.

Getting around in many parts of US or Australia for example would be almost impossible without a car. So if you ever plan a trip to these places please go with people who can drive, but of course do contribute by navigating/keeping the drivers entertained on road trips!  \n\nAlso I personally just don\u2019t enjoy driving. I can get quite anxious and panicky so driving just makes me more stressed than anything else. I\u2019ve met many people who genuinely enjoy it though, and I think it makes so much more sense for such people to be on the road instead."

However, even then there are many places I would rather take public transport to. Parking is always a bitch. It helps that we're very small and our MRT network is getting more connected.\n\nDon't get a license because everyone around you is getting one. Our public transport network is fantastic, and in the time it takes for us to feel FOMO about getting a license and the time most of us can actually afford a car, we probably would have forgotten how to drive.\n\n(P.S Not that you asked, but even getting the cheapest motorcycle works out to be a few times more expensive than taking public transport in the long-run, but the catch is that you are at least cutting down your commute time by at least 50% on average so it's an *okay* trade.)"

Do you currently/intend to have a job that requires a car? i.e. your car and required expenses can be classified as work expense\n5. Do your loved ones supportive of you owning a car and is willing to also support the expense of it (not just monetary)?\n6.

To me, I feel having a car improves your quality of life if you can afford and willing to throw into car ownership.\n\nImagine this, house mortgage loan, money for your parents, household expense, kids expenses, kids insurance premium, your own insurance, personal phone, broadband and u need even to finance a car loan, road tax, fuel, car insurance, maintenance. Maybe medical expenses as well.\n\nSo if you chose not to own a car when you are young and free, you probably won't start doing it after you move into your own house with kids.\n\nI started to own a car when young and I still own a car now with two kids. If I have financial difficulties in the future, the first thing to go will be the car. My current car is about 3.5 years old and have recently paid off its loan.\n\nWith the current Coe prices, the annual costs to own a car is about 18-19k (10k depreciation + the rest for fuel, insurance, road tax and maintenance).\n\nSo you might wanna think about it. Hope this helps! YOLO!"

Many people are under the very common misconception that \"pilots are useless\" if all they do \"is turn on autopilot and relax\", that's absolutely false.\n\nThey got much to do more than just \"turn on/off\" autopilot. Allow me to explain if you will;\n\n They have to constantly communicate with air traffic control, be on a look out for weather, monitor vital systems of the aircraft and performance of the aircraft, be prepared and plan for emergency should it occur and also the amount of planning beforehand is crazy, the amount of stress in having to deal with so many factors, fuel (dependant on weather also), weight, weather planning (to avoid unfavorable weather areas), late passengers, the stress of the company breathing down your neck wanting you to depart on time to avoid extra delay fees etc, these are the stuff pax don't usually get to see haha\n\nAutopilot is not there to completely eliminate the workload. It's there to assist the flight crew by reducing  their huge amount of workload (e.g. figure things out any technical issues should they occur, while the plane flies by itself), hope you get the idea haha"

I imagine they can\u2019t be arsed to deal with us, sometimes.

(although pricier than normal surgical.)\n\nfor reusable sports mask, I've tried underarmour and its pretty good but the nosebridge is flimsy. I've ordered dermacool next. (got lots of people i know using it and say its pretty good).  \n\n\nif you're getting a local sim card. get a local non contract like gomo or grid. (I've bounced from gomo to grid to gomo based on promotions. current like $24/50gb of data per month)  \n\nnot sure if non citizens can get it .  \nbest reception generally is singtel + singtel mvno (like grid and gomo)\n\nliterally you have to ask your colleagues around tuas viz reception for other telcos. (eg: the newest telco's in the market isn't up to standard yet, having no reception in building basements or mrt lines)."

Very peaceful (don't speed, cameras everywhere) watching the streetlight go past.\n\n3) Yishun Dam - can stop road side and look at the sea. If you go on weekend midnight, there will be stretch of cars, ppl like to fish there. Just be careful of LTA cos it's technically double yellow line \n\n4) Random roads in Holland, Bukit Timah, and Bedok South area - i like rooming at 8 figure houses and there are lots of them there\n\n5) Mount faber during early morning\n\nif you're bored you can what i do, i drive to parks like kent ridge/ mount faber at night and just sit there and stone"

Not too long and she gets 40 minutes of exercise each day.\n\nI used to spend nearly 3 hours a day driving. Public transport would have taken me four hours."

And maybe unearth other factors.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my working life (mostly in Sydney) trying to minimise my commute times by renting closer to work or buying closer to work - only to have my plans undone by forced transfers and being made redundant. And ending up with some terrible commutes.\n\nIn Sydney your salary definitely limits your options, too, especially if you want to buy. And affects the length of many people\u2019s commute.\n\nIt\u2019s a long time ago but I remember some of my colleagues had great commutes and others long commutes. And yes, that was very much divided along local/expat lines. \n\nI had a very short commute - my wife maybe 30-40 minutes. Singapore\u2019s MRT has grown a lot since then."

After a while, she had some mild runny nose and went to a SASH/PHPC clinic which coincidentally was one of the clinics listed as vaccine clinic. The doctor actually help assessed her on the spot and told her she can take the vaccine with no problems. And the receptionist at the clinic helped to arrange for the appointments for her to take at the clinic. That was back in end April. She had her first shot 3 weeks ago at the clinic by the doctor. So far no problems. \nSo maybe after the QO pass, you can consider taking your mum to a vaccine clinic (22 clinics islandwide) and let the doctor assess to see if she can take it. The doctor will request for exact medication she is allergic too. And/or severity of her allergies."

We don\u2019t count as \u2018students\u2019 and instead we pay adult fares for normal trips, though there exists a university concession card which gives you unlimited rides on bus, mrt or both at a cost of between 55-90.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re overstating the need for Mandarin lmao. Besides, cai fan isn\u2019t the only cheap food option if you search around. You should also allow for a bigger food budget (~500) since $5 meals don\u2019t exist everywhere.  \n\nRent budget is fine I think (maybe push it to 800 to be safe). I\u2019d suggest you stay in Paya Lebar/Dakota since they\u2019re on the Circle Line, same as Bras Basah (since from your posts you\u2019ll be going to SMU?). They\u2019re old but decent neighbourhoods with cheap food and the National Stadium/East Coast Park is not too far away if you want to just have a chill walk outside.\n\nPhone budget is ok. Might wanna increase your \u2018others\u2019 budget just in case? No need if you\u2019re confident about your spending.\n\nSo yeah the final budget comes up to 500+800+90+20+90=1500. Obviously you can go even lower than your own budget or higher than mine, but I think mine accounts for more unplanned stuff + better quality of life (necessary to counteract uni stress) so you could consider it."

Uni student has concession for mrt only, which is around $55. Assuming each trip costs $2, back and forth is $4, you just need to 'go out/school' for around 16 days to breakeven. So even on the weekends, if you go out, just take the mrt to your closest destination and walk wherever you need to go. This works out quite well for me and save a lot of momey (+ exercise too)\n\nIt can also be good since youre an international student to be exploring Sg easily on the mrt. \n\nSeeing that you are a woman, do avoid staying near places around Geylang area if you can. Not that it is super unsafe, but generally at night it could get a bit shady. This extends to as far as Eunos area. This comment could be a bit controversial but just my opinion. \n\nIn terms of food option, $5 per meal is decent for day to day - try to buy from hawker and food court to save money. U can save on breakfast money by buying a large loaf of gardenia bread and make it fancy by buying sliced ham. This can make breakfast cost to around $1 per day or so. \n\nOne thing to note is going out/entertainment on the weekend. This can easily get very expensive. A meal in a cheap restaurant will cost easily $15 upwards. And a movie on the weekend is around $10 iirc. So do factor those in as well."

If you are going to use WiFi most of the time at home or in school, then you can actually cut that $20 down even further by going for the $10 for 6Gb plan. They have rollover data for 2 cycles so if you are not a heavy user, you can have double the data in the next month.\n\nIf you find that its too low, then try to wait for Giga's pop-up promos which happens usually during special events or holidays, then upgrade to get the $18 for 50Gb plan. \n\nHowever, that also depends on where you are staying cos Giga is under Starhub and their coverage is rather spotty in some areas like where I stay.. I get like only 1 bar in my house and 2 bars if I move close to the window. Their internet speeds are pretty good though.\n\nThe other alternative is TPG Mobile that offers $10 for 50Gb but I've no experience with them and I do have some concerns about their mobile coverage in Singapore. They have their own network. \n\nIn any case, these SIM-only plans have no contract, so you are free to switch after a month or so.. do read the fine prints in case there is a clause for early termination.\n\nFinally, DO NOT buy pre-paid cards... they are a complete rip-off IMO.\n\nOn transport, its really not too expensive to move around here. If you stay in the heartlands, the rent will probably be cheaper too.\n\nHope the above helps!"

                "comment": "Rent: 750 might be a stretch for CBD imo. You look for mature estates (heartlands) which is further away but would likely be cheaper. Furthermore, SG's pretty small and commuting wouldn't be that long.\n\nFood: I think $5 per meal is pretty okay for hawker food but that means no drinks, nice dinner or meals in the city. You'll have to live on a strict diet. As for pricing, most hawkers have a large menu on their signboard or pasted on their stall. If you were to stay in the hearlands, it can be about $3-4 per meal at hawker centres.\n\nPublic transportation: there are no discount fees for anyone after high school so you should assume paying for adult fares. Fares are about $2 per trip (or slightly less). To and fro school would be $4 and for 31 days in a month, it would be $124. You can save by taking the MRT before 7:45 am where there is a $0.50 discount. \n\nPhone: $20 is possible. You can try Gomo which uses the infrastructure of the largest telco operator (Singtel). Have been using it for some time and so far there was no issue with receptions or any other issues. I've not manage to hit the 20GB (they sometimes give bonus data) mainly bcos work/study from home and availability of wifi everywhere around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can drop me a message if need be!"

There are some telegram chatgroups which you can consider joining for the occasional discount codes/promotions (usually for food).\n\nEdit: saw the above comment on $55 for MRT only.

She got more pragmatic and understood the difficulties of earning a paycheck when she got her first job.

In fact i also came from a low income family, with my dad being a taxi driver and my mom self employed.\n I've seen seeing a few comments about how young girls have \"princess dreams\" of wanting to be tgt with a rich guy who drives, bring them out to restaurants and buy luxuries. Would like to say not all girls are like that, some would even feel insecure due to not earning as much or other reasons. \n\n\nPersonal experience was when i had to choose between a guy who is able to spend over $250 on a single date (he's a regular in the army, earning around 4k/month) vs a guy whom our first date was to go running and have LJS for dinner (nsf with less than 1k/month), and i picked the latter. Being well off didnt mean anything to me, even though i was struggling to get by day by day with my banquet pay (around ~700/month). And it's how he treats me and how he taught me about managing my finances (because he came from a low income family too), and i honestly feel that if i chose the former, i would not be learning these stuff that helps me grow as a person. \n\n\nTake your time to find your other half because such things cant be rushed and they may come from places unexpected. Seeing how the girls you met are always \"high ses\", you may need to lower your expectations then you'll find the right one for you."

That is the reality, and most women are not comfortable dating guys who are less well off than them. Most guys are not comfortable dating women who are better off than them.\n\nIt's not that you can't or won't find matches and dates, it's that one or both of you may feel uncomfortable about it, and that already is the seed of incompatibility.\n\nThat said, have confidence. I used to date girls who were much, much better off than I was. At the time I was taking the bus and renting a room while dating young women living in landed properties and daughters of rich tycoons.\n\nI was a very, very confident young ( introverted) man.\n\nIt's perfectly doable if you can stomach them paying for things. Some of them don't mind the large income gap, and the ones that do mind only really do so initially. Your personality match is usually enough if they like you.\n\nRight now my wife is the main breadwinner. She pulls in about 70% of the combine monthly household earnings. She initially had a lot of issues with it, but we've been together 17 years already. So clearly it is quite doable.\n\nAt one point, I told her she is free to go find another better earning man, because that isn't  my priority. If that's what she wants, I'm not that guy. \n\nLike I said, I was/am a very, very confident guy.\n\nI would say to not let self-doubt hold you back from giving 100% of yourself to your dates, but also understand that it is perfectly normal if women don't want to continue if you make less than they do. Don't beat yourself up over it. Use it as a means to improve your situation and move up.\n\nThe most important thing to women is that their men are doing something, striving, and ambitious. Most women are willing to go through that process of growth with you. It is the striving and the mindset of striving that is important, not the actual success. \n\nThis is one of the reason women will put up with guys who are gung ho and (over) confident.\n\nLearn not to care that you make less, but strive to do something with yourself and your life. You will find women will accept that more than your absolute dollar amount."

There's been zero expectation that I have to pick them up. And I'm 30 (so all of the matches are around there), the age where you can reasonably be expected to be able to afford a car. I'm assuming you're younger cos you talk about your parent's income and not your own."

It\u2019s much cheaper to have a steak or pasta dinner at home.

They also decided to self sabo and not talk to me anymore (interest level dropped to 0 once they asked about my education / work) (or maybe they decided I wasn\u2019t fun or cute, idk, there was no feedback form). \n\nIf a girl really likes you, she will work with you for a brighter future. That being said you guys have to be compatible. There are lots of girls out there who wear flip flops and shorts / cheap clothes but if you\u2019re going for beautifully dressed girls in brand name labels instead then you should be well dressed too. \n\nPeople also tend to put in some effort to look better the first time they meet, too."

Nonetheless don\u2019t let your family background define you and I hope you are working part time too. \n\nBeing poor isn\u2019t so much an issue when you are young.

My advice: Work hard, be ambitious, don\u2019t let up until you have at least a 5k income then reassess your level of contentment."

My mum is like your parents (\u201cfind a rich man\u201d) but my siblings and I never took that seriously. My father instead emphasised that we should be able to provide for ourselves rather than rely on other people. I don\u2019t think ignorance is excusable in this day and age leh. Especially for an individual in their 20s who has gone through the whole gamut of school + starting work. That should be enough life experience to have less of a biased perspective, unless they are wilfully ignorant. Not sure which OP you are referring to but this applies to both."

If your spouse is going to be a femme/homme du foyer, then ask for more $$ as well. Minimum leave in SG is 12 days, so ask your employer for more. if you ask for S$200k you may get it, depending on your negotiation skills, although I'd say S$70k is enough to enjoy life, assuming no wife/kids. since SG has very low taxes for the rich, you'd probably save alot. \n\n1000 EUR/month for Paris (assuming a 2P apartment) is extremely cheap, although I'm surprised you only get 45k EUR/year as a lawyer. 400 EUR groceries is fine if you eat local stuff, imported cheese/wine will cost a bomb in Asia. 300 EUR/month hobbies?! are we talking legal stuff heh? in SG, most people just hang around the malls & drink bubble tea. \n\nyou should ask your employer to get you health insurance inclusive of dental coverage. healthcare in SG is extremely expensive & get reach S$100k for some surgeries. the pharmacies sell medications that cost more than the ones in Paris 13e."

                "comment": "Well typically people say beginners should get a used bike, because you might drop it, and also they factor in upgrading in the future. But if you solely want to use it for commuting, don't plan to upgrade, and not \"into\" bikes, just go for a new one.\n\nJust note the price of bikes is at an all time high now, I think a brand new nmax might cost you like 12-14k. Personally I'd go for a nmax over an aerox solely because the nmax has disc brakes front and back, as opposed to the aerox which still uses a drum brake in the rear (not as much stopping power, harder to maintain, and have an annoying squeal when the pads get old).\n\nIf you do go for a used bike, I'd suggest getting one that has done maximum 10-12 thousand kilometres in each year of it's life. Anything more than that means that it's either been used for delivery, or the previous owner has had very long commutes, both cases mean it's been used and abused.\n\nEdit: alternatively if you have the spare cash, you could try short term rental bikes to see what you really like. Most shops don't allow riders with less than 2 years of riding experience, but I'd recommend 2 shops that do:\n\nVroom leasing (can find on carousell), slightly more expensive, but they don't have minimum number of days rental, and they will do delivery and pick up to your place.\n\nAuto exchange, I think they also don't have minimum days rental and allow p-platers to rent. If I'm not wrong they're having this promo where you get 20% off your rental if you say \"I love farhan tre!\" (a YouTuber promo)."

Do your loved ones supportive of you owning a car and is willing to also support the expense of it (not just monetary)?\n6.

So if I am in Punggol, I can't order from some place at the opposite end of the island.\n\nTheir subscription removes any delivery fee, so if you order more than 3-5 meals from them per month, it's worth the subscription as you end up not paying any delivery fee thereafter.\n\nPersonally we use Deliveroo in our house. Their riders are fast and reliable, I suspect this has to do with how they break the Island into zones for delivery. Grab delivery is really random. Sometimes fast, sometimes takes forever. Sometimes they are close by but still take forever.\n\nThe delivery system just feels less organised than Deliveroo."

I left Singapore to pursue my degree abroad and during this brief period, my social circle became small. So small, I can count them using my fingers. The amazing friends stayed and the ones that weren't meant to remain in my life long left. \n\nHaving less than 10 friends now, I barely head out over the weekends. I am mostly cooped up at home, watching my shows on Netflix or killing time by heading over to dating applications. I don't complain, though. My life is drama-free now as compared to my teenage years. \n\nI have done solo activities when I was abroad and couldn't care less about what people had to think of me. Heck, I would even do them here in Singapore if I had time in my hands. The good thing about ang moh country is that they won't judge you for being on your own, unlike Singapore, but don't let their reactions get to you lol.\n\nJust wanted to say you are not alone. You have one life, go live it!"

I think it started from Primary school when I got ostracized, I pushed myself away from people.\n\nEven now, I do many things alone. I watch movies, eat meals, walk around malls, visiting museum exhibitions. There's this simplicity in doing them by myself: no need to plan around people's schedule and the constant need to satisfy their needs/wants. \n\nBut it does get lonely. There are many occasions where I feel like sharing stuff with people but realise I have no one to do that with.  \nLike you said, there's this feedback loop that the more things you do alone, the harder it is to step out of this comfort zone. I have had relationships in the past, but after ending them, I find it difficult to get back into the game."

There are times where I feel desperate for physical contact and affection (I often hug my stuffed animals to control the feeling), I become depressed extremely easily and when I become depressed, I will literally crawl under a blanket, pull my hood over my head, curl into a ball, and shutdown. And if I don't do so, it puts stress on me and I become either short with others or just go silent altogether. It sometimes gets annoying, but I manage."

However there is a fine line between being happy alone and using it as a shield to hide behind our own shortcomings. Might not be that way for you, but it is for a lot of people. \"Studies first, Career first\" as other people like to put it.\n\nBut here's some good news. It's not going to be this way forever. You're already on the first step towards growth, Admission. You've realised you want different and you want better. And you're definitely going to achieve it, if you put in the work!\n\n-\n\nSide note: I too did lots of those things you mentioned alone in my free time as well!

I do have social interactions but most of the time I prefer being alone.\n\nI think the important thing here is whether or not you're happy. You sound like you've gotten accustomed to it, but also there seems to be hints of wanting to socialize more. You also sound like you know what is the barrier here, i.e. you are 'different', at least in terms of interests, personality, appearance. \n\nSo the question then becomes: is a solitary existence sufficiently painful for you to want to make a change? If yes, then there's nothing wrong with 'conforming', at least a little bit - what matters is you can touch your heart and say you're happier. Otherwise if you think you value 'being yourself' more, then so be it.\n\nIf what you need is hope, know that change is very possible and can come at a stupidly fast pace, especially as a single working professional with financial freedom and no commitments. Everything you've described can be learnt and changed, if there is the will behind it. Happy to talk more on PMs."

Well I used to be alone a lot more often than now but I do miss the times where there were no peer pressure, felt more productive and be doing things that I like a lot more. But I realise I got depressed quite quickly being isolated and I forced myself to adapt beyond my comfort zone, part of it thanks to NS. Social mingling was like a routine of problem solving and pattern recognition for me just so that I could react and \u2018speak\u2019 the right way.\n\nBut again, as someone who used to be super introverted, I wouldnt push anybody else to do what I did. It does bear a lot of cost, physically and emotionally."

For example volunteering for certain causes, or joining certain hobby groups. It's especially helpful to shift the focus from the feeling of loneliness to actual works instead. When you find something you like/care about, you can then find a group or community around it, and hopefully make genuine friendships due to mutual interest :)\n\nI'm a loner too, and I found happiness in doing the above. I learned that friends would go away anyway, especially when they got married and have kids. It's not like they don't wanna spend time, it's just life priorities would change. So rather than being groggy about finding friends, I'd rather spend my time on being productive and focusing on my life \"mission\""

For some time, I felt pressured to have an active social life. People say uni is the best time to make friends, living on campus all the more. One should be hanging out with friends Everyday. Reflecting on my life, I do spend large amounts of time by myself, cooped up inside my room instead of out and about. It may sound strange but reading the book: \u201cQuiet, the power of introverts\u201d, helped me to feel more comfortable with myself. Some people get energy from others and some get energy from spending time with themselves. I do Have a couple of close friends whom I am very grateful to have but I know I enjoy having a substantial amount of time to myself. \n\nI think there is nothing wrong with spending large amount of time with oneself. It it makes you happy, do it. But human are still social creatures and we may crave social interaction from time to time. Common interests really bring people together so maybe u can find people with common interests. Online platforms like reddit can be a good way to meet new likeminded people too."

The only person I know who imported a car from Europe is a millionaire architect. The Certificate of Entitlement (basically permit that allows you to own the car) is much more expensive than the car itself. Parking is expensive and will get even more so. There are many other expenses such as road tax, insurance, COE renewal etc etc. Drivers are also so rude on the roads (due to the high levels of stress here), I've met many who have a complete disregard for other's safety or just want to take out their anger on you. We're such a tiny country, we cant have everyone owning cars. Public transport is pretty good, taxi, grab, gojek are very reliable and affordable. Also, if your wife a highly skilled expat, she might likely get paid enough to afford the expensive rent in the city centre. So that cuts down on your transport time/expenses too."

From a quick internet search, you can book a [Grab Family](https://i.imgur.com/IkKw2Z8.jpg) ride (at a higher rate) and they will provide a car seat or booster suitable for children above 1 year old. Taxis are not required to provide any child restraints beyond seat belts and regular Grab rides aren't supposed to accept children less than 1.35 meters tall. So, you will have to hold your baby in your arms or drag your own car seat with you while you shop, dine out, etc. I don't have young children, so I'm hoping someone with more experience can jump in to offer further insight."

I still won't say he's 100% supportive and understanding though - it highly depended on his mood. The other bosses that are far from supportive and understanding are locals.\n\n3. Autonomy for the work that you do and the ability to learn and move across departments - none at all. All 3 bosses I've worked for are micromanagers (varying degrees). So much that I've given up on working for small companies.\n\n4. I've only had health/dental insurances from 1 startup (the American boss). The rest, nothing at all.

There are many MNCs out there and majority are quite enjoyable to work in, but unfortunately, the one I joined had left much to be desired. \n\nI used to work in an American MNC (Fortune 500 company) for 2 years. This was what I experienced: \n\n- Long working hours: officially they say you can come in any time as long as you're there during the core business hours of 10am - 4pm and you work 8 hours + 1 hour mealbreak. Reality is I often had to come in as early as 6.30am - 7am and leave as late as 11pm - 12am due to the work. Too much work and too few people. \n\n- I once thought, since they said as long as you're here within the core business hours of 10am - 4pm, so I can come at 10am right? No. The AD said we must start at 8.30am. \n\n- There's a lot of conference calls, webinars, town halls with European/American colleagues, but 100% its us following their timezone, not them accommodating our time zone. That meant staying up till 1am or waking up at 3am for calls. And for certain positions, there's no time off after that. You finish your call at 5am and then go straight to office. \n\n- Benefits: Some of the benefits/perks are indeed way better than those offered by many of the local companies, but its still quite far cry from those offered at Europe/US. \n\n- Annual Leave: We had a strict quota on annual leaves. The company gave you like 21 days of leaves (AL + special leave types), but rest assured its very hard to take leave when you needed to. You had to reserve a slot a year in advance, and leave freezes could come in anytime due to \"business needs\". \n\n- Vacation: The company was good enough to have special vacation i.e. shut-down for many of their offices during festive periods. For example, the US office is closed for a week or more during Thanksgiving and Christmas, while the China office is closed during CNY. Not for us here. There's no shut-down. And the worse? those people at offices that shut-down won't respond to any emails, and its very frustrating when you needed to get approval or get things done. \n\n- Office culture: Unfortunately, mine had a toxic culture with lots of backstabs. People there like to claim credit but when something goes wrong, they all disappear. \n\nI was considered a renegade in the office in a sense that most of my coworkers always look up to the ang mohs, and that whatever the ang mohs said are correct. I don't work that way. If someone said something that wasn't right, I would question back, ang moh or non-ang moh. That unfortunately was not well-received in the office. \n\nThe last straw for me was at the end of my 2nd year. I put in a lot of effort, pushed very hard, and was in the top 40% band. \nMy reward? $500 bonus, $30 increment. \nThere was also no AWS (13th month). \n\nI threw letter and left afterwards. Many others followed too, and it was certainly bad for some of the bosses as the company had high attrition rates and one of their KPIs for that year was staff retention. \n\nI went to a local MNC afterwards, and though the culture is very much different and quite rigid by many's standards, at least my job role gave me the work-life balance I was looking for. Plus, I get a 13th month and a fat 2-month bonus cheque even though I'm not in the top 50% tier. \n\n--- \n\nBad things aside, there were indeed good things my ex-MNC provided, such as free medical benefits - you get a card that allows you to visit panel clinics for free, and the company insurance guarantees you for hospital stays. \n\nOh, and the pantry is good too! The office occupies a few floors and on one of the floors, half of the space is used as the pantry where they have a billiard table, free flow soft drinks and biscuits, and weekly supply of fresh fruits. There also used to be a Wii console but you have to bring your own games. Unfortunately, I did not use that pantry much as we were so busy, and it'll attract unwanted attention and bad consequences for me if I were to even play that Wii during my lunch break. Things like \"Wow, you even have time to play Wii?\". Its mostly the ang mohs who utilise them. \n\nThat being said, I have many friends around me that worked in MNCs that have better work-life balance and a better office culture. \n\nOne of my friends worked in a Fortune 500 company that has a flexible work arrangement where you can work from home for a few days and come into office for a few days. \n\nThere's also another of my friend whose MNC gave generous allowances, bonuses, and many benefits. Some even have arrangements where they fly you to their other offices around the world to exchange or gain valuable experiences. \n\nAs for the company that I left, I think they got to their senses afterwards, and when another wave of attrition hits, they managed to retain a few with very generous retention bonus. There was a guy who was a high performer but was disillusioned, and when he threw letter, they promoted him, gave him a $5000 retention bonus, and a very high increment. But of course, that caused quite some unhappiness and made a few others leave. That guy eventually left too, but was lured back afterwards with an even better remuneration package. Well, that's good for him I'd say."

SME, MNC, French, American, British. \n\nI\u2019ve knocked off at 6pm sharp before. Or worked 27-hour days (this is not a typo). \n\nI have no bonus, bonus calculated in days not months, and I\u2019ve had 6-month bonuses. \n\nIt would be sweeping to imagine work culture translating from one country to the next. \n\nThere are stingy MNCs, and generous MNCs. Where benefits are concerned, they\u2019re determined by the local leadership and their tie-ups with panel healthcare or insurance providers. \n\nThe only thing within your control: research. Glassdoor, Fishbowl \u2014 sites like this give you a good picture of what the local environment is like.\n\nNo 13th month? Work that into your 12-month compensation. Clock too much hours? Document and be ready to speak up for yourself or walk away. \n\nAs a manager, I see too often subourdinates whining away and *doing nothing* to try to make the circumstances more favourable for themselves. The real irony is that if they\u2019d flagged an adverse situation and come to me with a solution that allows me to course-correct without compromising business goals, they would actually walk away with a few new things that work in their favour. \n\nEqually, I\u2019ve hired people who could tell me what they want from the organisation during the interview over *yes* men/women who would agree to anything to get the job. \n\nI\u2019ll turn it around and ask what do you want out of a job. A salary is the value of your output for the organisation right now. Work experience is the value you command in the job (after the next one). \n\nTake a stand or walk away. It\u2019s a good philosophy in life and career."

This would help you determine whether the increase in base is worthwhile to make the move. \n\nIf you are in the negotiation stage, be up front with the recruiter and use your total comp as a base and see how things goes. If you decide to drop it in the end, I see no harm as this is part and parcel of a job search. The recruiter should not put a red flag on you just because you rejected their offer and went for another which met your expectations. \n\nCan't stress enough to be as open to your recruiter about your expected as much as you can.

It\u2019s something you need to get used to traveling on the public transport system with a folding bike. Also, there are different types of folding bikes which would make it easier for you to travel around with, such as the trifold ones like brompton, 3sixty, pikes as compared to bifold ones like dahon, fnhon, camp, java etc. However the trifold ones cost more. \n\nPersonally it would be easier to travel on trains as compared to bus as there\u2019s more space on trains. I would recommend getting a 14-inch that is small and lightweight for your 8-year old which he should be able to push it on his own. Alternatively, you can consider getting a bicycle bag for you to carry it instead while pushing your own."

I like planning route that ends at the beginning of mrt line so cfm have place to put. Cycle anywhere n end at marina bay for example.\nHas seen father n son 2 folding bikes going into bus on saturday evening. Father carried the bikes in via middle bus door just like wheelchair.\nEasiest bike to bring mrt is those china bikes with a triangle stand right under the seat. What we do is just fold mid frame once, no need to fold handlebar and push thru mrt. We have 16 and 20 inch. For brompton 3sixty style the cons is we have to keep an eye on it at all time due to expensive, so cannot just lock outside n go buy groceries or something, so really gotta plan route and pit stos properly.\nCarousell is your best bet for 3sixty, 900 to 1400. Make sure try and see if u comfortable in term of cycling position. We find 3sixty straight handle uncomfortable due to short arms and upgrade $50 to M bar."

IMO, fundamentally, city/ economic planning is at the core.\n\nMost SE Asian cities with lots of bikes have allowed large numbers of vehicles flocking into the city as they keep prices of cars, bikes, parking and fuel low. In this type of congested cities, bikes are good to weave through the heavy traffic and affordable to many. Congested cities aren't productive as people would be spending too much time on the road.\n\nSpreading the commercial activities in the city across a wider area to ease congestion. In a less congested city, if cars and parking remain affordable, then cars would be a preferred choice over bikes, especially in tropical climate. This is what I think is happening in Western cities.\n\nOverall, I feel that Singapore's objective, given its size, is to keep the traffic smoother to facilitate more commercial activities. Hence, keeping cost of personal transportation high and providing good mass public transportation."

Usually covers souse and children as well. \n\nTakeaways- for one person a steak, curry, pizza etc usually between $20-30 a time\n\nGroceries for 2- really depends what you eat. I probably stop off at the supermarket twice a week and spend about $75 a time. Beer, bacon, sausages, cheese, hand etc are quite expensive and usually start around $10 each, beer starts at about $15/4 pack, bottle of cheap wine starts around $25\n\nGym memberships - in the city prob closer to $100 month, out of town about $60 month\n\nTaxis- depend on time of day, if your lucky a 5 min ride not peak hour could be $8, a 15 min ride during peak times could be $30+ \n\nMRT/bus- depends how far but never usually more than $2\n\nSide note: Marina Bay and Orchard are overrated. If you\u2019re willing to go 15 min drive out of the city on ECP/AYE in either direction you\u2019ll get twice the space or pay half the cost."

Assuming family of 4-5, average restaurants range from 50sgd to 200sgd per meal, hawkers probably less than 30sgd. Groceries from cheap supermarkets like Sheng shiong can be around 300-400sgd per month but usually expats go to Cold Storage or Marketplace and it\u2019s much more expensive. A decent 3-4 room condo in downtown be around 4-5k sgd, car (mpv or suv) anywhere from 150k to 350k depending on brand, usually 3-5k sgd per month including insurance/taxes/petrol, also greatly depends on if new car or not. If using public transport, way way cheaper. \n\nUr budget of 16k is way more than enough to cover basic living expenses considering our median wage is around 4-5k, but if u wanna enjoy in Singapore it\u2019s a different story"

Alternatively, you can walk in via the Sentosa Broadway and it\u2019s free.

You're looking at maybe 3M to 5M for a 3-bedder within walking distance of the MRT. If you're willing to consider something slightly older, I do see a unit (built 1997) going for 2.3M right now. So it is possible, but your options will be limited simply due to the small supply and the popularity of the neighbourhood. \n\nIt's easy to get groceries delivered (Amazon Fresh and Redmart amongst others), so if you remove the supermarket criterion, you can look into the developments around Farrer Park MRT especially d'Leedon. If you're ok with slightly older developments, that opens up significantly more possibilities in that neighborhood too. A budget of 2.2 to 2.6M should get you someplace comfortable.\n\nMoving westwards along the Circle Line will get you the Buona Vista, One North and Kent Ridge neighbourhoods all of which do not have many condominiums available within short walking distance of the respective MRT stations. They're mostly around at least 15 to 20 minutes walk away. At least you'd have no problems finding supermarkets and eateries around here.\n\nFurther west at Haw Par Villa MRT, you have a sizeable cluster of apartments (more if you are willing to walk up Pasir Panjang Hill) but you wouldn't have food and groceries nearby. Likewise for Pasir Panjang MRT. \n\nThere aren't (m)any residences at Labrador MRT at all.\n\nYou do have a few more options available at Telok Blangah MRT (like Skyline Residences) and Harbourfront MRT (Carribean and Corals at Keppel). A 3 bedder would cost you around 2.5 to 3.3M at these places. Of the two locations, Harbourfront is better as it's where Vivocity and Sentosa are of course. At Telok Blangah you have a more local vibe as you have HDB and hawker centres close by."

I\u2019d like you to look into Normanton park - it\u2019s an upcoming development bounded by a nature park and short distance away from Kent ridge mrt (which has a hospital & mall with decent enough options), and connectivity to Buona Vista station one stop away. It\u2019s access to Holland village without the bustle and almost living within a nature park. (The houses need to be checked in person to ensure the sound from the highway doesn\u2019t bother you - the unit I lived in before it got torn down had zero noise at that time). Your nearest wet market will be the gim moh one, not inconvenient.\n\nDollar wise, setting aside housing purchase, I\u2019d think you\u2019d need at least 250k to meet that lifestyle just barely. Sending your kids to public school, renting outside city and cooking at home drives costs down quite drastically. You will miss fresh food unless you pay top dollar almost all produce is shipped from overseas.\n\nThe one you asked about - I think your estimate for education is bang on. It\u2019s only if you can\u2019t get admission to public schools that it will higher"

Then you can come out ahead owning.\n\nFor example, the place a friend just rented is $3000 per month but $1.5M to buy.  Owning would run you $4-5k all in after putting a heft down payment down.  Add on top the ABSD and you\u2019d need to see strong appreciation to come out ahead (that said the same place would have rented for $4k per month before Covid, so closer to breakeven).\n\nThat said, rents can go up (so that\u2019s a risk - there is no rent control), but also the housing market is carefully managed by the SG gov\u2019t to ensure it doesn\u2019t get to overheated or starts crashing.  So it\u2019s not an entirely free market like Canada or the US.\n\nSo I\u2019d say if you were going to stay in SG for a long time, then yeah, buying could make sense.  But if you\u2019re thinking of a shorter stay or not quite sure, just rent. \n\nJust my two cents."

More expensive the more desirable the area (proximity to shopping and MRT).  Keep in mind housing is smaller than Canada.  So 2-3 bed would be a 800-1100 sq ft apartment.\n- if you rent, assume $4k+ per month in rent.  Again, can be more or less depending on location and how nice it is.  This is a newer 900 sq ft place (bigger if more remote) not downtown, but close and within a 10 min walk to MRT.  Very easy to pay $8k per month for a big place in a desirable area like Orchard.\n- you won\u2019t qualify for public school, so assume $25-40k per year per child for international school\n- a basic car (Prius) will cost you $100k upfront ($70k for the car, $30-40k for the road license).\n- groceries will be comparable to Canada if you don\u2019t try and recreate a western diet with lots of meat, cheese, etc.  if you try to recreate a western diet assume 50% more expensive than Canada.\n\nYou won\u2019t pay anything more than SG income tax, so take home will be higher than Canada by ~20%.\n\nI\u2019d say you could do it at $250k per year, but you wouldn\u2019t have a lot left over if you have 2 kids in international school.  $300k would be more comfortable."

Like what you suggested, we plan to first rent for a period of time to find out how much we enjoy the life in SG, and which neighborhoods would suit our lifestyle better. With that being said, it would still be good to know beforehand what life quality is to be expected before the relocation. From the discussions here, it seems safe to budget a monthly expense of roughly $5k+ for rent, or $8k+ for a 25-year mortgage for a relatively comfortable life.\n\nAs far as I understand, apartment complexes entirely dedicated to rental and managed by a company are almost not existent in SG. And from what I saw on propertyguru, a lot of the listed properties there are currently tenanted. I think this adds a layer of insecurity if renting. But I totally agree that economically speaking, buying and selling within a few years most likely leads to money loss. We will purchase a property after we are certain that we will stay in SG in the next ten years or so."

I attended international schools till I came to Singapore and my parents (who had been posted to a country with no suitable international school at my level) decided to try local schools, instead, because of the much vaunted Singapore education system.\n\nI enrolled at ACS with no issues and subsequently (to this day) find our top schools here on par with or better than any international school on offer. I\u2019ve not hesitated recommending to my foreign friends that they send their kids to local schools (saves a TON of money!). Still, when I came, that was over 30 years ago and it\u2019s a pity if, indeed, spaces are so limited now that their children are excluded by virtue of these limitations."

Can you afford to comfortably pay the downpayment plus instalments with your current income 2. Whether you think it is worth it to top up that difference to own a car instead of taking public transport. Pros include more convenience esp if you have young children and if you need to go to places with less than ideal public transport frequently. Cons are in some cases taking train may be faster than driving esp when you go to CBD or Orchard. You also tend to waste time when you have to send car in for servicing, washing, grooming on regular basis.\n\nIn any case since supporting a car will form a large part of recurring expenses do think thru properly."

I stopped going on tours and planned free & easy trips with my family by driving to locations and spend longer time there. Road trips. California\u2019s Big Sur was memorable (Go google and understand why). Sure, it looks daunting, US drives on the right and I was worried beforehand.

Have to be man and machine as one to maneuver, you will know when you start driving.  \n\nFinally, if there was a zombie apocalypse, I will confirm have a higher survival rate than you unless you run as fast as Usain Bolt.

They even have theory practise questions akin to 10 year series, if u can get the questions right, u can pass the 2 theory tests (without studying, just book practice sessions and drill yourself) \n3) private students don\u2019t have the same level of access to the \u201c10 year series\u201d, are at the mercy of the driving school if they wish to book practical classes at the circuit and slots for their practical test. \n4) school instructors teaches you what the traffic police (testers) are looking for, essentially if you follow the instructions (to the tee) technically it\u2019s quite difficult to get things wrong (I\u2019m the product of the system, some habits die hard (which my husband and other driver friends can\u2019t stand))\n5) BBDC has the highest passing rate (I must admit BBDC doesn\u2019t have the same stress factors as the ones at Ubi) \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure private instructors teaches the most practical and efficient way of driving and are way more affordable, just that popular private instructors are harder to get and because I\u2019m a chaotic person, I appreciate the structure. Hope the info helps, just realised I\u2019m getting way more long-winded along the way  \ud83d\ude05."

I had interviewers asking why you did badly in university, and my answer was I could not focus in studies due to mental health issues, financial stress and an unstable family environment.\n\nI hope you all do not judge me for this if you feel you had similar family issues. It is hard to explain the dysfunctionality in my family. I lived with my parents and three sisters together in a three room HDB. I did not have a bed to sleep on, my dad mentally ill, my mum gambled (passed away last Feb), and house had bed bug issues. I did not even have a computer in my first semester of uni that I can use for my studies to write reports and do research .\n\nMaybe for most of you, it is hard to imagine such families exist, but they do."

If you have a coffeeshop near your place of stay, that'll be great. Food in such setting cost anywhere from $3-10. tbh you can probably get some good food for $4 or so. If you feel like splurging in a restaurant, it would definitely cost more.\n\nTransport - stick with public transport and you should be fine. 1 Grab/taxi ride, assuming $20, could probably pay for 5-6 MRT trips(to and fro). \n\n enjoy nightlife \n\nThis would probably be where the bulk of your money goes to. Depending on how much you drink, you probably have to set aside $200(or more) for drinks, food, and taxi back home.\n\nOverall, Singapore is not as expensive to live in as what one may think. Avoid tourist traps and you'll be fine. Do let us know when you actually live in Singapore and perhaps we can then help you further to find cheap and good food! \n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any questions. While I may not have all the answers, i'll try my best to help you!"

Regular bars and pubs will charge between $10-15 for a pint of beer or a cocktail, and expect the prices to double if you visit clubs instead. A night's out drinking would probably cost you at least $100, excluding taxi fares and supper. Cigarettes are also another killer, costing around $11-13 a pack."

That is, until I moved. And now that I'm accustomed to how it is here, I do find that Singaporeans are more stuck to our phones than here in Germany at least.\n\nBut I think a large factor of that is that we're so busy? We're in a constant rush to/from work/school, and we know once we get there we'll be busy with homework/work/housework. So we take whatever time we can get in the commute to 1. Connect with friends, 2. Catch up on social media, 3. Watch shows/dramas\n\nReally it's just us being super productive! \n\n(p.s.

I know some flats have popular sharing especially for malaysians (around clementi, jurong, woodlands, yishun etc those areas)\n2. includes PUB, internet. basically all in. \n3. includes basic furnitures like mattress, fan, etc. the one that just let you move in with luggages. \n4. allow light cooking \n5. make sure you have clarity of using washing machine (trust me, some landlords only allow x numbers of usage, e.g. once per fortnight or per week, some micro manage like purposely semi sabotage by shortcutting your washing etc). \n6. get a contract and signed by both parties eventhough it's not exactly legit. \n7. make sure you take pics before you move in. <== important in case if wears and tears etc during dispute when you move out. \n8. find out the roster of cleaning & usage especially on toilet matters. some owners are just simply gross. or other renters. \n9. make sure you have your dedicated areas for storing dry food, inside fridge, and footwears. \n10. if you can, try to avoid those landlords with kids. trust me, you will thank me for this. \n\nall the best for you."

I am pretty sure many have their fair share of such encounters.\n\nThe approach is always the same; First they will ask if the price can be lowered. When you refused. Then they will start bargaining with reasons why the price you are selling should be lowered. Lastly, they will ask if you could meet them at another location other that the one stated. The ultimate they will ask if the item can be delivered with you bearing the cost of postage."

                "comment": "Just had two bad carousell experiences recently. Was looking for old british coins for DIY and to replace the coins that I lost ages ago. First experience was when I made a request around late night and asked if seller had the coins that I wanted, he said yes then he told me that he had two different sizes of the same coin. I asked the seller if he could provide a photo of the coins cuz I wanted to check if the coins were the same or not. Instead of providing a simple photo, the seller goes on to rudely accuse me of questioning the authentication of the coins and calling me a 'time waster' and wants to 'block me'. He also tells me that 'I don't know what I wanted' even though I kindly made my interest clear to him. In the end, I tried to reason with this jerk and received no reply. My other experience was also quite similar, I made a request with a different seller for the same coins around late night as well and seller took his time to reply and back forth. I made a reply around afternoon and from there, I received no reply from seller. The next day, I received a reply from seller in the morning but I did not reply back until around 6pm cuz I thought he lost interest. I told him to quickly settle deal so that I did not have to keep on chasing him and then he rudely tells me I was being impatient ( I waited since that afternoon even kept my account online ) and goes on to say he will donate the coins to a donation box. To be clear, I tried to reason by suggesting to do postage since he was too busy but within a second, seller deletes the listing. \n\nAdvice to anyone looking for particular small antiques and novelty items especially 1 penny coins, I suggest that you don't waste your time with carousell and just go to etsy. Etsy abit pricey but the stuff there is good quality and the sellers there are genuine."

Monthly expenses for a child is not too difficult. It adds about $500 more to your budget; but that depends a lot on how much you want to spend.

They are the ones who gave the authority to sell this faulty product.\n* The brand may have the problem but it's lazada who were selling the item. sure I can contact the seller, but if this doesn't go to what I really need done. I will go back to Lazada to inform them of the situation. \n* Check the Item description and the Title description of the product. if the item is faulty and or doesn't match with what they said on the ticket and description. push for return. \n* If they don't want to have it return. push for an option to drop it on a Nearest Pop station (if it would fit) . \n* Tell them the days of how many days have you been dealing with this issue. \n* If they still doesn't want to go for a return pushing really hard back. tell them you'll be buying the item again AFTER you have this item returned back. \n* Calling Lazada also seems to have solve most of my problems. their customer service over the phone seems to be more understanding than the ones of in e-mail. \n\nJust remember, with all these inconvenience because they sold you a faulty product doesn't give really you the right to shout at them or get mad over the phone. but just state your issue and share the inconvenience that you are experiencing, put them in your shoes that if you were to receive this type of item and that its been XX days.... etc etc.. but please remember the human.."

Though it is really up to you but I have to say that quite a lot of my friends do seek the help of a psychiatrist, or at least a counsellor when they need help so pls don\u2019t worry, you are normal!!\nIMO one or twice a week could be abit concerning - maybe try seeing if there is some sort of pattern such as place,time,location or even other stuff like after eating things such as curry or what not ; it could potentially help inform you as to whether it is really linked to your history of anxiety! Though should this kind of thing happen again, you could look up for grounding techniques (the 54321 one) which I hope could help you tide through the episode.\nLast but not the least, don\u2019t worry about the driving thing! ( chances are the more u think about how girls go for guys w cars n whatnot, the more it becomes apparent that way so it could be biased in a sense!!) There will be someone who will accept you for who you are :-) I\u2019m really sorry I don\u2019t have expert advice for you but I\u2019m praying you\u2019ll be okay and that you\u2019ll be able to achieve your goals!!

Now I am married and have kids and I'm motivated to work to look after them. \n\nI'm surprised though that there's really nothing you enjoy - what about movies/tv-shows, video/pc games? I feel like even if I've had the worst week at work, I can watch a cool action movie and escape away to another world for 2 hrs. And I've spent many, many hours gaming, which I really enjoy. Does none of that work for you? \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry you're feeling so down about things - i hope that you can hang on for a bit until things can become clearer for you in terms of what you value/enjoy - i really feel that over time you'll develop this self awareness, and then it'll be much easier to be motivated and prioritise how u spend your time."

Here are some things you can do to stop being a wage cuck as soon a possible: \n\n1. List down all your assets (savings, cpf, investments etc.) and liabilities (debt, mortgage, etc.). I do this on an excel spreadsheet. Calculate your net worth by subtracting liabilities from your assets. Do this every quarter. It gives you an accurate picture of your financial health. \n\n2. Track all your expenses in detail for 2 months. This will give you a better idea of where and how you're spending your money. You might think you know, but you don't. So do it. \n\n3. Start saving. If you start saving $500 a month from the age of 25 you will have around 450k by age 65 assuming a 3% annual compound interest rate. That's fucking shit. Try to do better. I lived with my parents, meal prepped and had 0 social life when I started working at 21 just so I could save almost all of my $3000 salary. \n\n4. Have an emergency fund. I do 12 months worth of cash that'll allow me to sustain my current lifestyle.\n\n5. Learn the basics of investing. To be honest I'm fucking lazy about this shit so I do the bare minimum by parking most of my savings after the emergency fund in an income portfolio on Stashaway that gives me a 3-4% return. \n\n5. You can invest the $$$ in your cpf ordinary account after 20k I think.  I haven't gotten to this yet personally coz I'm lazy af. \n\nAnyone can do all this. You literally have no excuse. Quit bitchin and maybe go see a therapist if you can coz you sound depressed af."

Seems like you actually 'enjoy' putting others down with the most cynical views you can muster. You shoot down every \"helpful\" comment, and scorn the people who try to offer help. To the less perceptive, your terms of \"wage cuck\" may seem to be referring to yourself, but its a title you proudly brandish to mock the people that have accepted this life.\n\nThe folks here are a tad too nice. They fall prey to cynicism easily.\n\nYou enjoy knowing that other people are suffering? I could not express the term \"self-absorbed\" in better terms.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. It's all about You. You dont care about anyone else accept yourself. The whole \"masturbation is the only thing that gives joy\" is a perfect example in the quest for self-pleasure above the needs of all others.\n\nYou wear the fake smiles to people who know you, but under the shelter of digital anonymity the mask falls off and you couldnt care about anyone else's 'feelings'.\n\nTake a minute from your busy schedule of narcissistic thoughts to think about someone else instead of yourself.\n\nYou're a deep thinker, you cant find any meaning because you've got the wrong idea that life is only for your own self pleasure and enjoyment.\n\nHow can you help someone who doesnt want to be helped?\n\nThe solution isnt how people can help you. In fact, it's the complete reverse. What can YOU do to help the people around you now? Even in your current cirumstance.\n\nI was in a similar situation. Depression for 2 years with suicidal thoughts. Counselling was bearable at best. The world seemed pathetic, bleak and meaningless. But I managed to break out of the bubble and stop being so full of myself when I realized I was hurting the people around me and destroying their lives, when I should have been the pillar to keep them together. And with that realization manifest into action, everything became better. And I mean REALLY better...\n\nLife takes a new meaning when it isnt all about you. When the motivation for your actions isnt self-pleasure, but the well being of others. The quest for self-happiness can only be achieved when you pull others up. Not the reverse.\n\nI challenge you to think about others (especially the people you're closed to) for a change. It's not easy, but it'll make you feel much better than right now. What have you got to lose anyway?\n\nThe people who are stuck in depression are those who cant get over the fact that they're stuck in depression... slaves to their own minds.\n\nDont be a depression cuck (: You can make the right choice... or not. Makes no difference... I'm just another stranger on the internet."

Perhaps the Wage Cuck would not like to imagine that the results of his labour is paying the tuition of his Wage Master's spoiled children, or contributing to the tax dollars that pad the Minister's pockets. Indirectly, but still causationally, there is a poor university student pay his student debt (through tuition fees) or a new government payout that his labour/life partially contributed to.\n\nIn this regard, even if Wage Cuck does not recognise it, his existence is a definitive boon to society (and general human kind). He may die refusing to acknowledge it, but that is the facts of his past actions.\n\nWith regards to the would be kind souls out there. It is just my opinion, but I do not think the Wage Cuck (in general) does not need our pity, our guilt and definitely not our middle class biased advice that do not seem suitable for their life contexts. Neither do they need our openly acknowledged gratitude (I believe they are too bitter for that).\n\nI think instead we should treat them with a healthy degree of... Neither respect nor fear is the rifht word here. More of the awareness that without them, that if they killed themselves, we happy folk would be significantly less happy as we would no longer be able to benefit through their painful labour.\n\nJust my thoughts."

But I want to point out that what motivates most people around the world to keep working despite how hopeless or unhappy they are would be the fact that they have the above mentioned things to keep them going.\n\nYou might as well quit your current job that brings you so much misery and find a menial or self-employed job where people wouldn\u2019t be so superficial or engage you in conversations that you hate so much. (Because they are too busy trying to make ends meet) The lost in income probably won\u2019t matter much, since you don\u2019t have any interests or hobbies to spend it on. Even if I gave you unlimited funds and free you from being a \u2018wage cuck\u2019, you\u2019ll slowly return to being a miserable person because there\u2019s nothing meaningful for you to do and you\u2019ll be bored eventually."

So I can totally get why some one would have no hobbies, nothing is fun so why do it?\n\nBut my notivation comes from general goals i set to myself. Just bars, tasks, to do lists. Like in my life right now, I'm trying to save up for both college and a car. I don't really want either, what I really wish is i could do is lay down in a feild and turn into plant fertilizer, but because i cant i force myself to acheive goals, because it at least gets me somewhere. Its like this long bar that fills up.\n\nMake up some generic goal that'll take you a long time. When you reach it, make anothetlr."

No one in all actually gives a damn about you, unless close friends and family. That too also sometimes, own family and friends may not care about you (if let\u2019s say someone who isn\u2019t on good terms / has a stable relationship with the relationships they already have) \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is self absorbed. Depression comes in many forms and even emotions. Anger, pain, hatred, trauma, sadness, being void, etc etc. \n\nI sense that OP is materialistic and he isn\u2019t 100% wrong. Money does make the world go round (to a certain extent) You need money for a lot of things. If you have money, you can have the best life you can get (luxuries and even healthcare to a certain extent) \n\nWhen you were talking about being a deep thinker, OP isn\u2019t thinking of self pleasure and enjoyment. He already stated that he doesn\u2019t feel any enjoyment in almost anything. If he did have self pleasure and enjoyment, there wouldn\u2019t be a purpose in OP\u2019s post. \n\nRight now I\u2019m being judgemental, but it seems that you\u2019re judging OP based of your own experience in depression. I too struggled with depression almost all my life, but everyone\u2019s experiences are different. \n\nI think OP just feels tired that he\u2019s being someone else because he has to follow this \u201ccertain cycle.\u201d As in another comment I made, he needs to see a therapist to make his situation better."

What makes things worse is the fact that it's that she blatantly lied about violating the laws and tried to put the blame on you. In this situation, it's because she is unable to take criticism and she becomes overly defensive and pushes the blame because she knows that she doesnt have any substance or argument on her part which is why she pushes the blame to you.\n\nHowever, while your sister is indeed being selfish, I feel that OP should adopt a different approach instead of confronting of your sister, maybe try to be understanding as everyone is stressed out during these tough times and it's quite a drastic adjustment period for everyone. So maybe instead of direct confrontation (even though you have all the facts against her), try to be understanding and look at this not from a right or wrong standpoint but as a sister who loves and shows care and concern for her fellow family member.\n\nif we can apply compassion and kindness during these times, there is no doubt, that we will come out stronger together.\n\nEveryone has a part to play and as long as we commit to these measures, I am sure we will all prevail not only as individuals but as a community/country as a whole."

My oldest sister's weren't aloud to date till they were adults, same with me(youngest male) and my brother's; though my parents were more relaxed with us boys. In general we didn't talk to our parents about anything dating/sex life related. Partially due to my parents relationship with their parents, and also the fact that we were not aloud to date just stopped the conversations from happening.\n\nI think your parents have put a big strain on you and your sisters relationship. It is a big problem for you and your sister and makes it hard on you having to mediate for you parents. My sister's fought for the same reasons but more so because my oldest sister felt that if she didn't get to then my sister couldn't. And I'm sad to say my oldest sister felt like she had so much burden, she left the family and no one has seen her in years.\n\nREMEDY: Read 'The Mastery of Love' by Miguel Ruiz\n\nThis book will explain better than I can that neither you or your sister are at fault, yet both of you are. You are two different people seeing different points if view, picking different battles. You have to except people for who they are, and except that you won't always understand their choices. You can only chose your response.\n\nShe's 24, you can give her your opinion, but don't tell her what to do. You'll never get someone to agree with you if you back them into a corner(Another great book is 'Getting to yes' how to let people see your point but make their own decisions instead of fighting to win an argument). And search your heart; Are you just concerned for her well being? or do you feel like she gets away with more than you did? She is an adult, by law, she can go stay at her boyfriends for a month, and deal with the fallout with your parents. But if she wants to be supported by your parents, she should live by their rules, and learn to talk to them like you do. Stop being the middle man, you're not helping, be a mediator for them, a bridge.\n\nI was pretty young when my sister left, and she is so hot tempered, I often think she's better off finding her own way. But I have 3 other siblings and we do disagree. It's life. You just have to work on love if you want it to exist in your life. And except when you can't understand someone and let them make their own choices\n\n  \n\n\nGood luck!"

I'm sure she knows she's wrong but just don't want to admit it and doubling down. Also, no one is paying attention to her at home that's why shes \"suffocated\".\n\nIMO, you let her do what she wants as long as she doesn't come back home during the lock down. You still have to protect yourself and family."

                "comment": "I think this situation is actually quite complicated, although, it is quite clear that your sister is quite selfish about this. The law explicitly states what is illegal and what isn't, especially at such a crucial point of time for us as a country, we are literally depending on one another to be responsible for our safety. \n\nBut, I think its more than that. I might be wrong but I'm gna hazard a guess that your sister and her bf are probably younger(?) maybe in their teens? They don't sound like they can think rationally, and are driven by their hormones. I say that since she knows and agrees that your parents won't allow her to stayover for a month,  and if they were more mature, they would understand the sacrifice they have to make in this period, and find a way to make it work. I've seen so many couples share about how they don't like it, but for the sake of complying and for the society in general, they abide by the rules. Considering this, I don't think you'll actually be able to understand her point of view, she isn't thinking rationally, and she probably does not have the wisdom and experience that comes with age. \n\nSo i'd say she's in the wrong, but then again, at her age, it isn't exactly abnormal behavior, UNLESS of course she turns out to be in her mid twenties-thirties, then something is probably seriously wrong with her emotional/mental health, and she is just inherently selfish, - not realising the world does not revolve around her and her boyfriend. All this is based on assumptions of course. If she is actually older than I assumed, then I would just narrow it down to selfishness, and being unable to see beyond herself. \n\nEither way, it is a tricky situation, but still could have been handled more tactfully. Can be quite frustrating, but what I would have done would have been to ask her to talk to your parents about staying over with her bf from the start. It seems like she either does not understand how serious the pandemic is, or simply doesnt care. If she doesnt understand (which is quite unlikely), I'd try to get her to understand that, and the risk not complying brings to people she cares about. If she doesn't care, honestly i dont think that much can be done."

No flights to my country which is in full lockdown. Even if I get out somehow, MOM has made it clear that I cannot come back any time soon. So at this moment I have no clue when I will hold him again. Your sister can surely survive a month without seeing her boyfriend. \n\nAlso, how old are your parents? It is incredibly selfish for her to go out now when she is living with your parents. Just today I read a news about a pregnant lady who went into premature labor and lost her baby due to covid. These are the people we are staying home for. If there is any country we can safely be in lockdown it's Singapore. You have a roofing, food at your door stop, air-conditioning, high speed internet and what not. She doesn't realize the privilege. In my country, homeless people and daily wage labors were stranded in the streets and walked thousands of kilometers to be in their village. \n\nMaybe it was wrong you invaded her privacy. But try talking to her calmly and make her understand why it is important to stay at home now. It's really not about her. It's about the vulnerable people around her."

I think its somewhat unfair to make you relay unpleasant messages that she will definitely get mad at you for, when its your parents that did not allow her to stay at her bf's house for one month.

                "comment": "Below is my own personal opinion ar, just ignore if you dont like lol\n\n\nPersonally I would have just let her move in to her boyfriend's house. Im not sure whether you are the elder sister or younger sister,\nIf you are younger, just let your parent do the scolding part if they disagree with her moving with the boyfriend. I as a elder sister, found it humiliating when my younger sis trying to lecture me. It just made me feel horrible and embarassed. That feeling is unbearing, it hurts more when what she said was right and subconsciously I would try to argue or disregard it. Sometimes I myself dont understand it either, I thought I was angry, but after doing alot of self reflection, I think feeling hurt is the reason for the anger. Sometimes you need to see deeper, the reason for the anger. It might not be related to what is going on infront only. Like, when I'm having  bad day with my loved one, I get irritated easily during work without realizing I wasn't angry over the matter in front but it's about other thing in mind.\nWhat I am trying to say is, it doesn't matter who is right or wrong. It doesn't matter who started lying and who was at fault. As a sibling, you really need to ask yourself if you want this to work between you. You mentioned she wasn't disturbed at home and left doing her own stuff and it's suffocating. Maybe that's why. Maybe being left alone with no one to talk to is suffocating. Maybe she only feel cared when she's with her boyfriend, someone who understand her and made her feel at ease. Or maybe she has some issue in relationship with her boyfriend that made her feel insecure from being apart too long.\nThere are millions possible reason.\n\nIf you don't really care about her, just want to make your life easier, then just don't care ar. Let her be, why make yourself angered and upset?\nShe can do whatever she wants, if she's danger to family for bringing virus outside, let her move to her boyfriend's house. If your parent dont like that idea, then let them be the one doing the scolding.\nWhy do you care so much bout her lying and breaking the laws. It's not like you can really report her anyway. That will ruins your relationship with her, which you did already by bringing it up about reporting :3\nIt's kinda hurtful lol not that what you said was wrong.\nIt's very nice of you being the responsible citizen, kudos for that. But other than being the citizen of Singapore, you are also her sister, her family.\nHaving a bad relationship with a sister, who you see everyday, is simply mentally exhausting.\n This might sound horrible, but I would rather dealing with my sister being caught or fined by police one day, than having to quarel with her every single days. As it will be her own fault and she need to be responsible for her own doing. I would ve given her my piece of advice but she 's free to make her own decisions. I wouldn' t scold her afterward either, saying things like \"I told you so\", \"see why you no listen to me\" if she don't recognize her own mistakes, there is no point of me saying anything, if she already knows her mistake, I don't need to add salt to it, she feels horrible enough. Dont get me wrong, I love my sister. But the way I love her is not by  teaching her how to be a resposible human being but is to make her feel supported and loved.\n\nIf your main concern is that she might bring virus home,  there is alot of things can be done, such as giving her a mask when she s outside, make her shower immediately when she's home, using a different chopsticks when sharing food etc\nThese could be done easily, in a light hearted way had you guys been in a good relationship :3\nSince now you are in bad relationship, letting her move is the most straight forward method.\n\nMaybe you need to ask yourself what do you want exactly? Proving that she s wrong? Why?\nDon't want her to harm society and family?\nOr do you care about her? \nCoz knowing your own intention will make it easier for you to make decision. \n\nInstead of saying \"why are you meeting your boyfriend?\" since people get defensive when put into corner and feel like being interrogated.  Describe your own intention or feeling might work better\n\"I see you are going out, I'm actually very worried and concern that what if you accidentally caught the virus and be sick or what if it infected our parent. I'm scared\"\nOr\n\"i dont really give a f about you but im really upset and disappointed that you put our family in danger.\"\nLol"

As you won\u2019t know where she had been when she is at her boyfriends house, such as what she been doing or maybe gone anywhere. By letting her in again, you are just maybe bring back chances of risking an infection from her. She may say she never been anywhere much but how can we be so sure? Like she can\u2019t even sit still for a few days? Also just stop worrying or caring about her when she isn\u2019t thinking about her own parents.. if you really want to teach her a lesson, I would suggest reporting her to MOH or NEA.

At this point, I'd say stick to your stance, and continue being firm on what you know is right - your whole family will be affected by this. \n\nSaw a story on instagram, which raised an extremely valid point, in the case that your sister or her bf really contracts covid, they wouldn't be honest when doing contact tracing because they do not want to admit they broke the law and subject themselves to a fine, then the other parties' family would be at an ultimatum, either stick with the cover up and not go for a checkup and risk them all getting covid, or themselves having to admit their son/daughter actually broke the law and lied about contact tracing. Either way it'll end badly. The only thing your sister has to say about herself now is that its highly unlikely they will get covid, but can she really risk the health of your family? I don't know leh, seems like a pretty obvious choice to me. \n\nProps to you though for standing your ground though, sucks to find out your own family member can be a little b."

I really think your sister should be communicating better with your parents about each other's wants and needs and drawing clearer boundaries.\n\nAs for your question about whether that's a big ask, it's gonna be a different answer on who you ask so it's best discussing that with your sister. Get to know what her gripes are about spending long periods of time in close quarters with the family and why the prospect of spending it with her bf seems more attractive.  \n\nI'm the same age as your sister so I'll add my personal 2 cents just in case you might find it relevant. I love love love my Dad and bro but I like spending planned time with them. I'll even do fucking boring shit I hate like cycling or drinking smelly whiskeys but I'll only do it for the 1-2 hours we agreed upon and bond with them to the max but then afterwards they get on my nerves. I can't talk about things I'm interested in like ru paul's drag race or programming with them like I can with my bf and friends and I get v annoyed when they binge drink and play FIFA in the living room. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, these are tough times and family is important but we also can't choose our family even though we love them very much and in the interest of everyone's well being it's better to communicate our needs and come to a middle ground rather than trying to impose our wills on each other coz that's just going to lead to conflict and unhappiness."

With slightly better benefits and maybe a bonus component if your company plays nice. \n\nAt this stage in your career, breadth and depth is key in the work you do. Are you doing print, publications, social or BTL? The strategies for building your book will be different. And you need to be very disciplined if you want to avoid being grandfathered into the job. \n\nThe upwards trajectory and earning potential might be a slower climb for in-housers compared to agency, but the personal narrative you craft for your next career interview might make you more valuable, depending on what you choose to focus on in the current place of employment. \n\nMy advice to you is to keep a close eye on how the business runs and learn from it. That\u2019s what going to set you apart from other junior agency designers."

I suggest before starting the job proper, go through LinkedIn and see current employees from the same department and ask casual questions like any current exciting projects? Or how about past projects that u can learn from? Any software that u can familiarise with before u start proper? Bonus if u guys from the same poly - something to chat about. Or even same CCA etc. Do u know who ur direct reporting officer is? If so, connect and ask if u can proactively read up on some reports or learn some new skills at home before you start. Gain u brownie points hehe. U have also interned right? U can share with current employees about that briefly. \n\nSo after all these, rmb to have lunch with new colleagues. Very sian if the lunch is expensive but life is like that. \n\nBe close but not clingy to ur buddy. But please also connect generally with everyone together. Network smart so u know u dun get attached to people with bad reputation. DONT gossip and backstab; NEVER EVER do this especially when you\u2019re new and even if u think u can trust ur colleagues."

PUB usually cost 50 bucks, more during autumn-winter and summer. bunking into a hostel might cost more coz you get own room, with sharing amenities. \n\nyou're talking about culture. you gotta understand that it's depend on whom you're hanging around with. SGans tend to stick with SGans. few will break the circles and get friends with overseas students. different cultures, different habits. i can talk this for hours and will never end. in any case, it's pretty rare you will get to 'absorb' the local culture.  racism? one day if you're lucky, you will come across someone throw a remark 'true blue australian' in your face. sound familiar? yes. that's exactly what Singaporeans do to non Singaporeans here."

Currently  Maybank is offering 1.88% .  Some dealers will push for finance companies which charge much higher because you either have a bad credit report or your income does not satisfy MAS requirements. \n\n3. Unless your salary is high, refrain from buying a car so soon.  It will be a drain on your finances.   Unless you need it for your work otherwise you are just paying for it to be parked the whole day.\n4.  If you decide to proceed with the purchase make sure you ask for the car to be send for inspection.  You want o know how much money to set aside for repairs.\n."

In Munich, it was already part of everyday life. every plastic bottle brought into the machine translated to 10-20cents. and some bottles 50cents. that is significant money. your recycled bottles translate to a packet of chicken thigh - nobody throws them away.)\n\nI think right at about the same time, our govt was quite forward thinking, but the society was not ready. I did a research on these machines and found out, NTUC did attempt to implement the same system before, giving 10-20 cents vouchers for recycling.   \n^(Noticeably, in Munich... lots of people were needed to make this work, as it involves moving the crushed material away from the machines periodically)\n\nPerhaps NTUC did give up as it did not make business sense without drive from top down. They then tried to charge for all plastic bags at 10-20 cents a piece. That was years back - but with significant backlash.  \n\n\nIts heartening to see that our society has matured since then, and are a lot more receptive of the idea of bringing our own bags to reduce wastage now."

For glass bottles, we wash and bring it down to the recycable bins to dispose them.\n\n2. to carry our groceries home (i don't drive), we use carton boxes and wrap wet/cold stuff in newspaper / self- bought freezer bag. Newspapers and carton boxes and provided for free by supermakets. This also ensure we don't over buy and only buy things we need.\n\n3.

Otherwise, Chinatown, Balestier, or Bugis have some budget options and yet still accessible.\n\nWe don\u2019t have Uber here so you may considering downloading grab before you arrive if that\u2019s the preferred way to get around.\n\nIf you travel by taxi it is best to carry some cash, since there is a 10% surcharge on payment by cards. A typical 10 minute ride is about $10.\n\nIf you are intending to travel around free and easy, you can purchase a EZ-Link card from the transitlink office at Changi Airport. You can travel on buses and trains with that card and yes, there is a train station at our airport, just look out for the MRT sign.\n\nGoogle Maps work in Singapore so if you want to get around on our public transport you can just Google for transport instructions!\n\nYou can buy a SIM card from the airport as well, we have 3 main providers: SingTel, StarHub, M1. 3 of them provide similar prepaid SIM value and they have similar coverage and speeds, so if you are travelling to tourist attractions you shouldn\u2019t notice much of a difference.\n\nSome food you can consider to try is Bak Ku Teh, Chilli Crab, Chicken Rice. If you want to experience Singapore\u2019s style food, accessible places is Lau Pa Sat or Newton Food Centre. If you are on a budget, just Google hawker and you can go discover any hawker centre and what food they have to offer!\n\nYou can consider places to drink at Clark Quay or Boat Quay, where most of the pubs are concentrated on a river front. Do take note that Singapore have a law that prohibits drinking in public places after 10.30pm. If you are in a pub or restaurant or in your hotel it\u2019s fine, but you can\u2019t buy alcohol after 10.30pm from convenience store or supermarket as well.\n\nOh! And we have designated smoking area in Orchard Road shopping district so do take note. Smoking laws are quite strict in Singapore and cigarettes are expensive here too. Also note that if you intend to bring any cigarettes into Singapore you have to declare under Red Channel and pay tax at the airport, even if it is just 1 stick.\n\nAnyhow, I hope you find this useful!

If you intend to go out a lot, this pass is a life saver because it's unlimited bus and train rides.\n\nThat will leave you $550 (assuming your budget of $640) to spend for the next 30-31 days that will be $17 a day. \n\nFor food, I think that Clementi has some great options like the hawker centre just beside Clementi Mall.

If there is pain, what I can suggest is painkillers in the meantime, and see a dentist or GP for antibiotics if you get facial swelling. Worst case scenario, a medical GP at the polyclinic can issue the letter if you are in severe pain and there is facial swelling. \n\nGPs in private clinics can issue a referral letter, but this may not necessarily entitle you to subsidized status at the institutions. On arrival at institutions, if the cost is truly too high, you can apply for further subsidies by going through the medical social worker interviews. BTW wisdom tooth surgery being surgical CAN be partially claimed through Medisave. You sound young - check if you can qualify to use your parents' Medisave with the private clinic or institutions.\n\nTo keep things in perspective, DORSCON orange limits elective dental treatment at the institutions, i.e. if it's not a life-threatening emergency, most are not going to go ahead with elective treatment at this time. To reduce risk to all patients that present at the institutions - especially for those who may be exposed to COVID if just one slips through the cracks, and to conserve precious PPE stock for the medical staff serving the COVID patient population that really needs it.\n\nGanbatte to all the frontliners!\n\nTl;dr: painkillers for pain, if emergency i.e. facial swelling go see polyclinic GP for referral letter. Someone in the institutions will attend to you.\n\nEdit for more deets and to fix pesky spelling errors"

Wisdom teeth growing does causes headache etc, suggest you to take care of it when it's growing and after it's fully grown by brushing thoroughly as it's at the back of your teeth, harder to reach = food get stuck = bacteria growing = decay and then in the future you might need to take it out cus of pain which is more expensive than normal extraction. If it's still giving you pain afterwards, it could be it's pushing against other teeth or you didnt take good care of it then only do you need to take it out.\n3. Cant be helped with polyclinic not offering dental services, it happened to me too. If you have finance constraints, can apply/use CHAS card for subsidised treatments. Can do more homework to check abt prices among private clinics and hospital. RCT are just expensive, costs around $300 to $500 depending on which tooth plus you might want to get a crown afterwards....\n4. Just take care of your oral health from now on alright"

The dental clinic should be able to tell you upfront whether or not they can do xrays. Like what yuyuuji pointed out below, if you can wait for CHAS card approval, some clinics can claim government subsidy on your dental treatment. There is a certain amount you can claim per year so be aware that you might max it out depending on your individual situation.\n\nIF you want to go the institution route, usually the institutions will only deal with the complex procedures i.e. wisdom tooth operations, root canal treatments and crowns. Fillings and so on will be dealt with at the polyclinic or private clinic to reduce the waiting time for complex procedures at the institutions.\n\nEdit: As I mentioned above, wisdom tooth surgery is subsidized by use of Medisave. Please check with the clinic if you can use your parents' Medisave if you don't have Medisave."

Maybe your account is set to sg, or your number is tied to the sg number, so it directed everything to the missing office. Similarly the uber helpdesk form you used may still lead to the sg office for some reason, if it was from within the app. So it makes sense there\u2019s 0 response that way. \n\nSo I guess you can try contacting uber via their website instead? Or on your end change your account\u2019s phone number (like re-enter it to try trigger the verification that way). \n\nHopefully it works out for you. For me I\u2019m also travelling overseas in a country that has uber, and never faced that issue. Maybe because I changed my account\u2019s sg number to a foreign one instead before starting anything, so worse come to worse you could get a cheap sim to use while in europe & use that number instead for ubering."

Most sign boards and announcements are primarily in English, and in all four languages if space and time permits.   \n\nSingapore is pretty much a developed city-state country, schools are all \"in the area\" where ever you are, so it depends on if you're looking at particular \"branded\" renowned or independent schools if area matters.  \n\nWe have approx 40% foreigners, over est. 2 millions expats so the communities are pretty large. Not sure about Saudi Arabia in particular though.. But again, we have four official languages and races, Indian being one of them so I don't see many issues if you're thinking about integration etc.   \n\nGrocery wise, it's really convenient (I have 3 stores within 15-20mins of my walking distance which are 24/7) so applications are not too common although still used (Redmart is one - heard business is bad and they might be closing down soon though). You can also shop online directly from the grocery stores if you choose to (fairprice, cold storage, etc)."

Majority of these good schools also has a Chinese majority, with Indians being the minority. SAP schools, usually good schools, are also catered towards the Chinese. (HCI, RVHS). If you're not looking for 'good' schools, then I'm pretty sure there's many schools in any residential areas."

If you stay in hostel, your allowance would have to account for your toiletries/supper/snacks etc.\n\nFor me, I spent on average about 100-120 bucks a week when i stayed in. This covered the cost of my weekly meals and transportation.\n\nWhen i stayed out, i spent about 50-60 dollars a week. This covered the cost of my monthly mrt concession and lunch.\n\nBear in mind that i tried to save money and opted with the cheapest food (cai fan) as much as possible."

                "comment": "Public space\nYes, we are allowed outside. We are currently not under lockdown, but certain groups of people are either advised to stay home or are strictly no allowed outside, such as those who have returned from other countries have to serve a 14-day Leave of Absence at home, those who have come into close contacts with confirmed cases will be under strict quarantine, and those who show respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore, throat or fever are given a 5-day medical certificate and required to stay at home for the whole duration. \n\nThe government has assured us that public transport is still fully functional and have been regularly disinfecting public places. You can read more on government efforts to keep Singapore clean here.\n\n\nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/how-are-public-spaces-being-kept-clean-during-this-period\n\n\nGetting checked\nA typical Singaporean would get checked for symptoms of COVID-19 at a PHPC or Public Health Preparedness Clinic. If mild, the doctor will give the patient a 5-day medical certificate and advise them to monitor their health closely, but if severe/the patient\u2019s symptoms worsen, the doctor will refer the patient to a hospital to get tested. As of now, I am not sure what technology they use and how the testing is done, but one thing that I am sure of is that testing is free of charge.\n\nLearning from the past\nA quote from Minister Leong Hoe Nam: \u201cSARS turned out to be a blessing for Singapore. We realized how infectious diseases spread and how we have to be on top of the curve,  in terms of quarantining and surveillance, and being aware and having the diagnostic kits, as well as the health care workers all ready. That SARS experience has prepared us for the current epidemic. And if you look at it, Singapore is emerging out of this epidemic earlier than expected. We have controlled most cases and all of this comes from the roots from SARS. We actually see the government being proactive. We actually see the people being cooperative with the government.\u201d\n\nI personally do not have much to comment on about this topic, but if you would like to read more the link is here[...](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-03-02/covid-19-lessons-singapore-and-how-it-handled-sars)\n\nMedical personnel\nHaving no firsthand experience as a medical worker, I am unable to comment much on this topic either. However, Singapore\u2019s hospitals are definitely well equipped with medical equipment. When dealing with confirmed cases, our healthcare workers wear full-body protective gear, including goggles, N95 masks, and hazmat-style suits.  There is currently no shortage of surgical masks either, as the government has informed us that these masks are not necessary for our personal protection, they are for people who feel unwell to use so they may not infect other people. \n\n\nContact tracing\nSingapore has ramped up its contact tracing efforts by having 20 contact tracing teams instead of just 3. In schools, students have been made to sit in fixed, exam-style seatings to reduce intermingling, and if lessons are held with students of different classes the students are to be seated in groups(within their classes). Teachers are to take pictures of every seating arrangement for the sole purpose of contact tracing. At our Community Centres, we are also made to scan QR codes and give our names, identification numbers, mobile numbers, and declare we have not had any contact with suspected cases or those on LOA.The government has also recently developed an app just for contact tracing named TraceTogether. Here it is.\n\nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/help-speed-up-contact-tracing-with-tracetogether\n\n\n[FAQs](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs) for your reference. \n\n\nIf you would like to learn about Singapore\u2019s strategies in more detail, I recommend visiting the government website at www.gov.sg. You may also like to take a look at this [newsletter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iIVPfYWEQNzLpqRZBqhkFTc0hUiz7UqI/view?usp=sharing) I found very informative. It explains the differences between LOAs, SHNs and QOs in the last slide."

Any alternatives? Would help a lot in the \"not getting lost\" part.\n\nWhere are you putting up for the period in Singapore? There is the MRT (Metro/ Tube) which is pretty convenient to get around if you want to save some $. Alternatively, you can use Uber or GrabTaxi to get a ride. Do indicate that you want to get a pickup at the Departure instead of arrival, it is easier for the drive to find where you are. Eg Exit 1 of Terminal 2\n\n> I have the following things in my mind: Gardens by the Bay, the night zoo, Orchard rd, Sentosa (??? I will probably see some of it while going back-n-forth to ZoukOut), Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown, Little India. Any suggestions regarding my picks? I know it's not much of an \"itinerary\", but I didn't have a lot of free time to plan this trip.\n\nLittle India is fine, but do note that most foreign low wage workers from India / Sri Lanka / Bangladesh  (working in construction) usually spend their weekends in Little India. It get's pretty chaotic due to the influx of people.\n\nDo visit Chinatown in the earlier half of the day. Lots of tourist shops and stuff to look at (Hindu Temple, Chinese Temple). If you like a day tour + finding out about our History (Food History) you can click [here](https://www.viator.com/tours/Singapore/Singapore-Hawker-Center-Food-Tour-in-Chinatown/d18-6458SING1)\n\n> Also, on a different note: Any tips from veteran ZoukOut-ers? From Friday night, to Sunday morning I will be partying there, and I've heard a lot of good, but also bad things about the experience. Are the queues really that bad everywhere? Are the drink & food prices out of proportions? I've read some Facebook reviews, and this is all I could get out of it, and I didn't really like it, but what can you do...\n\nWater is served around $8-10 a bottle. (Last time i went was in '12) Queues are ok and pretty orderly. I recommend that you drink alcohol only towards the end / the last 2 sets else you'll get gassed pretty quickly. Just bring $200 and you can be covered for almost anything.\n\n> What about transport to-and-from Sentosa to the city? I will be staying on Dickson Road, which is pretty close to Little India stop on the MRT map. Is the public transport system working day & night?\n\nYou take the MRT to Harbourfront and you take the skytrain on the [third floor of Vivocity to Sentosa](http://staging.sentosa.com.sg/en/getting-around/sentosa-express/), get off at the Beach Station, its a 10 minutes walk from there.\n\nTransport system work both day and night. Last MRT is in between 12-1am. Then it's taxi / Grab / Uber after that.\nIt is pretty safe here, walking around at 3am won't get you mugged. There are lots of supper spots near your place of stay.\n\nOnce the party ends, there will be free shuttle buses from Sentosa -> Harbourfront. I recommend that you bring a singlet + small face towel so you can freshen up yourself before you leave the place\n\n > Oh and another thing... Sadly, from where I come, it's not unusual that tourists get scammed, so this is why I'm asking the following: any special things that I should keep an \"extra eye on\"? or any places NOT to go?\n\nDo not buy electronics from [Sim Lim Square](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/blogs/going-out-by-day/sim-lim-cheating-vendors-named-shamed-080508598.html) unless you know what you want and the RRP of the product. Another places to avoid is Lucky Plaza too. If you intend to get electronics, drop me a PM, i can advise where is a place you can go to.\n\nThere is no place not to go in Singapore, just don't be a sucker and get taken for a ride. You see that lady beckoning you for a drink at a Karaoke TV pub, you better know how much you gonna pay before blindly ordering stuff.\n\nIf you are into trannies, Orchard Plaza is the place for you.\nIf you are into standard prostitution, Geylang is where you want to go. Do note that the streetwalkers are illegal prostitutes. Legal ones are in brothels and typically cost more.\n\nIf you want to know about stuff in Singapore, you can post here or ask on /r/Singapore too\n\nParty hard, party smart. Welcome to Singapore."

Many nice bars/pubs to chill or have a nice dinner at. For sightseeing/shopping, you may also visit Haji Lane, which is in Kampong Glam. It is rows of shophouses selling clothing/\"hipster\" items. The backs of the shophouses also have pretty wall paintings that people like to take photos of.\n\n>Also, on a different note: Any tips from veteran ZoukOut-ers?

I've read some Facebook reviews, and this is all I could get out of it, and I didn't really like it, but what can you do...\n\nFood and drinks are generally quite expensive in ZoukOut. A cup of beer costs about $10. Most people who go to ZoukOut would buy loads of beer/drinks from the convenience store in Sentosa and drink before entering. I would suggest you do the same, or go to a bar/pub to drink before going to ZoukOut. Starker is a good option if you like beer, or FIVE bar for other types of alcohol.\n\nThe queue wasn't bad when I went to Zoukout 2 years ago.\n\n>What about transport to-and-from Sentosa to the city?

All tourist spots are very accessible via MRT. "

Of course, be prepared to produce documents so that the social workers can properly assess your family's financial situation and render the help needed (ie. Bills. Bank accounts. Questions asked will include how much you spend each month on what, got gamble or club or spend on things that aren't 'essential', got savings or not, got other children and why they not supporting, etc etc)."

And it's true, the financial district area is quite dead on weekends in the day. \n\nThat being said, if your working hours are regular, heading home during peak hours would be a bitch and hence living closer (BV) is an advantage. Also since BV is on the circle line MRT, you might enjoy going to Holland Village, Upper Bukit Timah areas where quite a lot of expats hang out. BV also has tons of buses into town and the night rider runs there too.\n\nIf you want to sightsee around SG, I don't think either location makes a big difference because it's more of an occasion instead of working distance which is more of a regular affair. The train and bus system is well developed here. "

My reasons:\n\n* General City Vibe: The whole atmosphere just feels unfriendly to me. It could just be me, but I am uncomfortable living in a city surrounded by large commercials buildings/towers. It just feels out of place for me.\n\n* Cost/expenses: Living near or in the city centre will obviously cost more. Whereas rent will cost less nearer to the outskirts.\n\nReasons for my choice:\n\n* Ease of Travel: You will work at the western site. Makes more sense to me to live nearer to the work place. If you live in Marina Bay, you will spend an hour or more to get to Tuas Biomedical Park daily. *Why not save a few more minutes of sleep?*\n\n* Environment: Living in a residential area just appeals to me.\n\n* Less Noisy: Although still bustling. It is less noisy than the city centre. Its more peaceful and quiet in a residential area.\n\n* More Space: I love to jog around the neighbourhood!\n\nAdvantages for Marina Bay:\n\n* More swanky\n\n* Easier to travel around SG\n\n* More sights to see\n\n* Easier access to the night life, i.e. pubs/clubs etc.\n\nIf it is your 1st time in SG or asia, I would like to add that SG is what we term **Little Asia**. As we are very westernized, it can be considered a **Gateway** for westerners to experience asia firsthand without some much culture shock.\n\nYou'll run out of places to visit after living here for a while, so don't bother so much about the local scenary. Use SG as your **BASE** and plan holiday trips to Thailand/Cambodia/Japan etc. if you can afford it.\n\nConsult some fellow Americans on the SG expat forum for their input. They may be able to offer some insight for you.\n\n* http://forum.singaporeexpats.com/\n\n**And lastly. Welcome to SG ;]**"

I will consider it 3-4 minutes per station so cityhall to jurong east would be 36mins thereabouts ) but yes. city hall is probably best. especially if you plan to go to the more upmarket gyms (fitness first, pure fitness or even california, true fitness, true yoga etc) anyway its more of a hub., you can head anywhere to try all the food\n\n"

There's a couple of tourist attractions on Sentosa itself(e.g.Luge+Skyride), as well as a couple of beaches you can relax and play in.\n\nOther locations you may want to visit:\n\n- Gardens by the Bay (Bayfront MRT)\n- River Safari / Night Safari / Zoo (You can travel by taxi/uber or bus)\n\nWe have parks and other naturey stuff too, if you don't want to pay for it you can consider:\n\n-Sungei Buloh Wetlands(this is really far from town), MacRitchie Reservoir, \n- Hort Park / Henderson waves bridge that you can hike/walk til Mount Faber and take a cable car that brings you to sentosa and back. This is near Telok Blangah MRT. Or you can take a bus from Harbourfront MRT.\n\nFor city sights you can visit Marina Bay to see the skyline or simply just spend it in Orchard Road for shopping.\n\nFor drinks and night life you can visit Clarke Quay.\n\nIt really depends on what you want to see and experience though. Personally I feel Sentosa has a lot to offer for family fun. :)"

I only speak English and have rarely had issues communicating in S'pore. \n\nDepending on what you and your family enjoy, these would be my recommendations of what to visit:\n\n* Gardens by the Bay\n* Sentosa Island (Universal Studios, awesome aquarium (expensive though))\n* Tiong Bahru - historic and hip neighbourhood, purposely not built up (all buildings capped at 3 storeys), best bakery, good cafes and cute shops (http://www.visitsingapore.com/walking-tour/culture/in-the-neighbourhood-tiong-bahru/)\n* Chinatown\n* Arab Quarter - pretty + can buy cheap pashminas here (expensive in NZ where I'm from)\n* Haji Lane - trendy and hip street, near to Arab Quarter\n* Night Safari\n* River Safari zoo - pandas!\n* Botanical Gardens\n* Singapore Museum\n* Peranakan Museum - showcases the history and culture of the Peranakan people. In a beautiful historic building and has a stunning collection of furniture, clothes, etc. (http://peranakanmuseum.org.sg/)\n* Eat at a hawker centre/visit Lau Pa Sat (http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/architecture/historical/lau-pa-sat/)\n* Singapore Art Museum (SAM) - always has great exhibitions and based in a beautiful colonial building\n* Gardens by the Bay - never seen anything like it before, also amazing greenhouses.\n* Marina Bay Sands - right next to Gardens by the Bay, there used to be a daily projected light show outside the mall/hotel. Worth seeing if it's still running.\n* For good views of the city - Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, ION on Orchard (free viewing deck)\n\nFor cheap meals, I would always try to eat at a hawker centre. Cafes, restaurants, and even food courts in malls can be expensive (or at least more expensive than hawker centres).\n\nThe MRT is very easy to use and everything is in English. I've always found taxis easy to come by and relatively cost-effective. \n\nHave a great time in Singapore!"

Try [Airbnb.](https://www.airbnb.com.sg/s/Singapore-?checkin=17-07-2015&checkout=19-07-2015&guests=2&price_max=150&ss_id=52osgqva) There are a number of [hostels](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/11-awesome-hostels-singapore-under-060100307.html) available. Some of them also list on Airbnb. Hotels can be quite expensive. If the hotel you're looking at seems to charge rather low rates or offers 3-hour blocks (eg. the Hotel81 chain), it might be a love hotel.\n\nCheap public transportation - Yes. A trip to most places will cost you no more than $2 or $3. The EZ-Link card is something like $15 with $10 in stored value or something. Also consider the [singapore tourist pass](http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com.sg/about-the-passes/) if you intend to visit lots of places. Public transport stops around midnight. Past midnight, uberX might be cheaper than taking a cab. All [cabs](http://grabtaxi.com/singapore/) here go by the meter, but take note of the [surcharges](http://www.taxisingapore.com/taxi-fare/).\n\nCheap food and drink - Yes. Eat at [Hawker Centres](http://www.yoursingapore.com/editorials/a-guide-to-the-best-hawker-centres-around-the-city-centre-of-singapore.html). Most meals are under $5, non-alcoholic drinks usually under $2. Just avoid ordering anything that doesn't have a fixed price (like live seafood). If you do want to order seafood, ask for the price first. Alcohol is expensive here unfortunately, even for locals. About $12 for a bottle of beer at most watering holes. The price goes up at clubs. \n\nYour question doesn't seem to be getting much response. Feel free to ask me if you have any more questions. Maybe try asking /r/singapore."

I have stayed in RidgeView twice for camps but I was assigned  a single room so I can't give my input on em. I understand that you will be travelling to the Science faculty for lessons and it's pretty close to RidgeView too, however, if you prefer to travel by shuttle bus, it may be difficult to board at the stop at RidgeView during peak hours as many students board at the previous stop at UTown. As for double rooms in Halls, they vary in design from Hall to Hall. Perhaps you can check their websites for any photos or floor plans to get a better idea of it!\n\nWith the meal plans, Colleges have a dining hall where the food are served buffet booth style, with different cuisines like Malay, Indian, Chinese, Western. You tap your student card for a receipt and a receipt redeems you a meal, the menu changes daily for breakfast and dinner and you have tap up to 3 meal credits per breakfast/dinner. Breakfast is provided from Monday to Saturday and dinner is provided from Sunday to Friday. My friends in Hall say that their meal choices are more limited but I guess it's all a matter of the price difference of the meal plans paid.  If you want to take a look at what's served at Colleges, you can add the 'RC Meal Bot' on Telegram, they update daily for both breakfast and dinner menus. \n\nGenerally I hear that there are more exchange students staying in Colleges and Prince George Residences(PGP) than in Halls, but I feel that they are all pretty welcoming towards exchange students. For activities, Colleges have College events, House events, Interest Groups and others such as Master's Teas, Master's Forum etc. They are not compulsory so you can join whenever you're interested! Not sure about Hall activities though.\nAlright, since I'm a freshman and I am only taking LSM1105 out of your list above, I can only give you advice on it: lectures are held twice a week, no tutorials, no lab sessions, there are graded pre-lecture online quizzes uploaded the day before lectures and homework quizzes as well but they are pretty short (approx 5MCQ qns). The workload for this module is pretty light but remember to read the textbook before lectures to prep for the pre-lecture quizzes, the profs will tell you which chapter will be taught when.\n\ntip: use the NUSMods website to build your timetable so you have an idea what your workload is like, remember to set it as semester 2 on the site so the data is more accurate.\n\nhope it helps!\n"

After lunch, perhaps head south to Sentosa island where Resort World is and either enjoy Universal Studio or S.E.A Aquarium. If you're adventurous, you may even want to explore AJ Hackett or Luge. Once nightfall, you can head back to Boat Quay or Clarke Quay area for dinner and a drink.\n\nI didn't suggest the other touristy places such as the Zoo or Botanical Garden as they're quite out of the way and you would want to spend more time in there rather than just touch-N-go.\n\nHave fun and enjoy your transit!

There's an app version that you can buy but you can always just use the mobile website and it is the same thing. \n\nBut as others have said, you should factor in a wide buffer time because the bus system is very unpredictable and varies widely depending on traffic conditions. I've waited an hour at the stop for my bus before three of them arrive at the same time. But thankfully that is quite rare. \nAlso, during peak hours you may not be able to board the bus because it is filled to the brim, so you may end up having to wait for the next one 10 minutes later. And even that one might be full as well.\nGenerally I steer clear of buses whenever I can. \n\n\nThe train system is slightly more reliable because the trains arrive regularly every 3-5 minutes, but occasionally there may be delays because the train slows down or due to increasingly-common track faults. So don't expect to-the-minute accuracy like in Japan; a 10-15 minute buffer will be good. "

At around $20 per night however per bed, you may be able to find a private room from $450 a month if you look through the ads. Some leases require you to stay for a minimum number of months however which is why AirBnB may be better due to its flexibility. What I would do is stay at an AirBnb option for a couple of nights and then negotiating a better price for longer term with the owner if i like the place.\n\nIf you really need to go rely on the cheapest option, some hostels offer free accomodation if you volunteer to do chores for a couple of hours a day. Rucksack Inn Singapore is well-known for this where foreigners work 2-3 hours doing chores like laundry etc a day for a night's stay for free."

If you buy big ticket items, there are [gst refunds available](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/GST/Consumers/Tourist-Refund-Scheme/)\n\n2. Same as most western countries, for places of worship, some temples have a no footwear rule.\n\n3. Cheap, you can use uber here if that's your jam, get a temporary EZ Link card which can be used for the subway or bus. There is a discount when you switch from bus to train and vice versa if your transfer is under 30 minutes.\n\n4. Do not go to Sim Lim Square for electronics unless you are with a local. Similarly, do not head to Lucky Plaza as a tourist. Please ask if you have more questions for electronic purchases. Non electronic purchases are fine everywhere.\n\n5. Get a sim card and tether when you land. else [Mifi](https://www.changirecommends.com/wifi.aspx) for the short term, otherwise get a broadband connection from Singtel, Starhub, Viewquest, M1 or MyRepublic. Do check with if internet is provided at your accomodation.\n\n6. Get it at the airport. Providers are Singtel, Starhub and M1.\n\n7. No Idea.\n\n8. Nope.\n\n9. Your school will most probably block torrents."

I currently stay around Buona Vista and its really convenient for me, but I think one of the major factors for you would be where your work place is located. \n\nIf you're working in the CBD area such as Raffles Place, then I would probably recommend places closer to the downtown area.\n\nAnother factor would be if you prefer bustling or quiet neighbourhoods and your means of transport. While it is convenient to be near the MRTs, if you don't plan on taking them and you prefer quiet areas then you would be paying extra to be near the MRTs for no reason. \n\nI'm super curious as to what you're working as although I understand if you'd rather not say! :)\n\nI'm honestly not that familiar with housing prices since I haven't really done much research on it so I apologize if I give any wrong info. Best of luck with your house hunting!"

Do not get fucked over by asshole landlords.\n\nDo note that your budget is really high. Even staying in the middle of the CBD cost at the Sail cost around $6k / month. Also it is a weak market now for people looking to rent, you can capitalize on the market weakness.\n\nQuestion: Will you be flying in earlier to look at apartments or find temporary arrangements while you look around?"

                "comment": "a) Housing\na-1) Rent seems to be expensive, but I wonder if it is the same everywhere?\n\nOf course rent depends on so many factors: proximity to MRT (train) stations, size of flat, area, how new it is, whether it's a condominium or a public housing flat. \n\na-2) There seems to be two types - entire house for rent or partial house (some rooms)\na-3) I'm married so I want to live in a house that is fully occupied by us\na-4) I'm okay with a one bedroom house\n\nI could be wrong but I don't think I've come across a one bedroom house. The smallest ive seen is 2 bedrooms. \n\na-5) I'm also okay with 30 - 60 minutes of commute.\na-6) What localities should I search for houses? And what are the average rents there?\n\nDepends on where your office is gonna be. \nIn Jurong East, Bukit Batok area.. common room - 400-700 is my guess. Master bedroom - 800-1000. \nFor an entire two bedroom unit, maybe 1.8-2.2k. \n\na-7) Do I need to pay an advance for the house before moving in? Like paying 12 months of rent in advance which will be returned to me when I leave that house (It's a common practice in India)\n\nUsually just one month deposit that's returned to you when you leave. 12 months? If anyone makes you pay that, they're cheating you. \n\na-8) Is there any other cost apart from rent? (like apartment maintenance fee, etc)\n\nIf you stay in a condominium, you might need to pay maintenance. Consider whether you'll really need a condo with swimming pool and gym and stuff. \n\nb) Transportation\nb-1) Cars are very expensive and I don't think I'll be able to afford them\nb-2) How much does it cost you to commute in bus/train per month?\n\nPublic transport is cheap. One way travel, max max max $3 per way. Assuming 2 way, 6/day * 30 days = 180 (Of course you don't work 30 days a month). \n\nc) Groceries and household items\nc-1) We are two persons and we mainly buy vegetables, fruits and rice.\nc-2) We try to be frugal as possible\nc-3) What would I be spending on the above items?\n\nUh, I spend about 200/month on the groceries mentioned above for 2.\n\nd) Mobile, Internet, TV etc\n\nd-1) I need to communicate with my family and friends in India, what is the best way to do this?\nFacetime? Skype? Whatsapp? I use all of these. \n\nd-2) Is calling over mobile networks cheaper over apps like skype? What about incoming calls over mobile networks? Just trying to get an idea here.\n\nIncoming calls are free for most postpaid plans. \n\nd-3) How much does Internet cost for usage like browsing, youtube, skype etc (No heavy downloads)\n\nUnlimited broadband access - I think it's between 45-65/month, depending on your speed and duration of contract etc. \n\nd-4) I don't watch TV but I think I'll buy one for my SO. How much do Indian channels package cost?\n\nHmm check Starhub cable tv's site. If I remember correctly from a few years ago, you need to get basic package + hindi/tamil/other channels, about 9/channel. Maybe a total of 40/month for cable tv. \n\ne) What is a reliable website to calculate tax?\n\nIRAS\n\nf) Did I miss any other important expenses?\n\nEating out? Come on, new place, you gotta try new food! :) (And yes, you can find loads of veg food here if that's your concern. )"
