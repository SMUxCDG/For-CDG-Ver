you know grab screwed up when taxi fares are lower than fares on grab,Neutral
"love it. more competition is sorely needed in the transportation sector, and grab should’ve never been allowed to buy uber sg in the first place.",Positive
honestly sometimes comfort is cheaper than other taxi services. and they would pick me up/drop me off at far flung places,Positive
"i'm no fan of grab at all. but i remember before uber and grab came along, cdg was the og monopolistic bully in the market. they'd raise taxi rental on drivers and increase fare at will. it was also super hard to get taxis. if i needed a taxi on weekends or weekday peak hours, i could wait up to 1 hour by the road cos sengkang was supposedly very far. most of us have forgotten the experience of standing by the road waving at taxis and them not stopping, and later when we finally caved in and call, we see the same taxis coming to pick us up. taxis used to be such luxury and would easily cost double or more the fares today. i  only had budget for 2 taxi rides a month as a young adultuber (not grab) changed everything!",Positive
"i actually very much want to use comfort over grab. however for me somehow when comparing prices between comfort and grab (from central to the north), it’s usually the same price (which i’ll book comfort) or grab is slightly cheaper (though now with the extra 1 dollar comfort may edge slightly ahead) -  not sure if this is unique to long d trips?",Positive
good. more competition always benefit consumers,Positive
"ah the weekly grab circlejerk. people still forget that grab tends to be cheaper during peak hours and is more consistent.i use all taxi brands and whichever is the cheapest, i go for it. definitely am liking this move from cdg.",Positive
comfort is mostly cheaper these days and the fact that their drivers are laojiao taxi drivers with no need for gps (which can be wrong at times).,Negative
they should fix their app first. the discount code always has glitches. even though the discount has been applied somehow you end up paying the full fare.,Positive
always used comfort after uber left.,Neutral
finally. for years cdg has been growing fat and slow from its near monopoly in taxi booking. only until uber and grab started with their vastly superior apps that they start to wake up the idea and start investing in developing their platform.,Negative
"didnt they just launch zig with a lot of advertisment and promos, why would they get ready to launch another mega app with the same services?!",Positive
"great, competition at work!",Positive
"fuck grab, that is all",Negative
this is my experience. grab drivers need gps and cannot go off map as they don't care to know the shortcut. cdg drivers thru zip don't use gps. they tell me the shortcuts they will take.the metered fares should be phased out as they encourage tricks of the trade. zip and low fares is the way to claw back business. maybe grab will be aggressive with their promotions after p2ha!,Neutral

"big big hooray from me! stop grab's money grabbing! support companies with diversified shareholding and stop padding the pockets of anthony tan! so many unethical practices and always go back on their promises (still angry they cancelled my delivery pass just when covid struck). rather tip the delivery guy more and pay grab less, that's the true meaning of support local, not support one man's pocket.",Positive
as someone who visits singapore frequently for work i was actually surprised how much cheaper (not affordable but cheaper) a conventional cab was vs grab...,Positive
"great to see cdg add services and improve.without competition, maybe they won't even have a mobile app.",Positive
they need to improve their app. it has a horrible user interface now. drivers and cars good though.,Positive
"i deliberately use comfort or gojek even if grab is cheaper. every single time i dealt with that company either as a consumer or an employee, they stank of  corporate greed of the worst kind.",Negative
during late night grab is usually cheaper.,Negative
nothing to love imo. they already had an app. now they are adding unrelated services into it like car rental which is irrelevant to 99 percent of current app users.,Positive
you are so right! i've been a loyal cdg user rhese days but i did forget of the monopoly days where we were at the mercy of cabbies.getting a cab after a night out was a nightmare on certain time of the day. i lived in the city. all the cabs wanted to go to bedok and wouldnt pick me up. i walked home on some days.,Positive
"i hated that constant increase of fare, and stupid reasons of we haven't increased fares in so and so years. then when they introduce a new taxi model bam! higher fares.but the absolute worst thing is the confusing as fuck surcharges, and area surcharges and surcharge for pickup at airport and rws/mbs.and if that's not all.....cdg owns sbs transit, who fucks you by constantly increasing bus fares year on year.so when people see cdg as some sort of 'saviour' from the likes of grab, all i see is a giant knocked of it's perch and now playing the victim.fyi: grab actually started of as grabtaxi which actually tried to solve the issue of an app for taxi booking.",Negative
"honestly there are some factors determining the price, such as distance, traffic and demand, to name but a few. ultimately if they are around the same price, i'd rather flag down a taxi for a cheaper price (no booking fee) and just go by the meter, especially when i know that there is little to no traffic. just curious if you book comfort, do you use flat rate or go by meter?",Negative
flat rate as shown on the app which is the one that is similar to grab. meter price always seems higher on the app (!!),Positive
"i've heard that grab is able to peek at the other apps running in your phone, and can detect when you're price shopping and adjust their offered price so that they don't lose out. whereas if you're not actively comparing, they know it's safe to gouge you.",Positive
"this is an important point, my personal experience is comfortdelgro cabbies have generally higher and more consistent professional quality - know the places, know the ways, smooth driving. some part-time grab drivers can really drive you crazy. one time the gps was not accurate in showing the entrance of the complex, and my dear driver religiously followed the gps and took me around the block two rounds....",Positive
if at first you don’t succeed…,Positive
"pretty sure grab's only enemy is itself, it dominate the market as long as it doesn't self destruct. comfort ,like all giant glc in sg , is unlikely to change or innovate fast enough and will die a slow death..",Positive

>straitstimes.com/singap...makes me wonder where all the grab investor money went.,Neutral
how?,Neutral
"they are in completely different businesses though. grab is going into finance, emerging markets, marketplace and so on, whereas comfort deals in the more established existing transport system. looking at grabs upcoming ipo, the additional funds injected + investor pressure will make it interesting to see if they will turn profitable within 2 years. if they do, i believe their future prospect would be better than that of comfort.entering new markets (be it geographical or product wise) is always difficult, you need to pump money in it.",Positive

"the flat was very dusty, cos since the previous tenant moved out it was unused and unoccupied till we moved in. other than that it’s a very barebones flat, no furniture whatsoever, just fluorescent tubes in every room (2 in the living room and kitchen), and toilet fittings. i applied long before covid was in the horizon, so yes, we did have some options. even then though, the number of flats available wasn’t a lot, i think there were like 30 flats available to choose. of the 30, there were 4-5 4rm tiong bahru flats @ sgd1500/month, and the rest were all 3 room flats all around sg at sgd600-900/month. our number was quite high, so we ended up going for the more expensive 4rm tiong bahru flats.",Positive
"nope, and no plans to get a kid till we get our bto either. only requirement is that we produce a marriage certificate within 3 months of collecting the rental flats keys.",Positive
"my flat in particular is one of the prewar sit flats that have changed hands a few times before coming back to hdb’s ownership. it’s right next to a very nice newish hdb, so i get the positive externalities from that, but our flats themselves have the bare minimum caretaking lor. also no lifts, need to walk up to our apartments. due to covid the area has looked quite unkempt in recent times though. neighbours wise is pretty alright, my stack the older neighbours who live above, below and opposite my apartment are very friendly, will usually have a chat whenever we meet, there’s a younger couple living a couple floors down who are low-key paggro and a bit aloof, so don’t really care about them.",Positive
subsidised rental is meant for the unfortunate. they seem to be able to afford the open market with that kind of spending.,Positive
"how many renters you know spend 6k for their rental unit. are u sure the hdb rental market is subsidised? some are approach condo prices. subsidised housing is only for those who really can't afford  the open market, not those who can splurge.",Positive

"your statement assumes that they have the freedom of choice. many conservative parents maintain a large control over their children's lives, especially through finances, severely limiting their ability to move out e.t.cfor a lot of people, it's not about ""caring"" about their parents opinion. it's because they simply are forced to.",Positive

"it appears so, with their profession.  however, the article says that the couple got their flat via the parenthood provisional housing scheme (pphs) which does not require applicants to be ""unfortunate"". hdb has another scheme called the public rental scheme to cover that class of persons.  i may be wrong but you seem to be conflating the two.  check the eligibility criteria for the pphs - no requirements for applicants to be financially distressed:  https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/renting-a-flat/renting-from-hdb/parenthood-provisional-housing-schemepphs",Negative
totally agree with you. but i will add that sometimes it could be out of respect or filial piety for the parents. you could still think and act for yourself on other things and still care for your parents' opinions or probably feelings.after all. different families adopt a different approach.,Negative
"and may i add, practicality. in singapore, unless you're earning big bucks, there is simply no luxury of choice. if you're not legally married before 35, you cannot own a hdb unit, and you're most likely priced out of private housing before that age. rental takes up a big part of your income if you decide to take it up, which is not exactly prudent when you need money for other expenses. also remember, 20% of your income is locked in cpf, which can only be used to purchase public housing. singapore is not like other countries, where rentals and home ownerships are priced more affordably as a proportion to your income. iirc, singapore ranks very near the top in the world in terms of most expensive rental/purchase prices for housing vis-a-vis the average income.for most, simply not moving out makes the most financial sense.",Positive
"correct, not only that, the government supports the parents having a high level of control. restricting the level of independence via living elsewhere.",Positive

yeah living together is a whole different ball game. you might even realise you don’t like certain habits they have. also might take longer than 5 years now with all the delays due to covid. so no i ain’t buying one.,Negative

many are on the waiting list for public rental scheme. the fact they can still allocate hdbs to pphs and heavily subsidize it is beyond me,Positive
6k doesn't sound like someone who need a subsidised rental.,Positive
"that's true. ultimately many households are in different circumstances, many parents raise their children differently.making general blanket assumptions and statements like the user i replied displays a lack of empathy.thanks for your perspective too!",Positive

"that was an idea suggested by a dj of a local radio show, which i have forgotten who and which station.another idea suggested by a friend was to assess how the so's family treat him/her, assuming family is a normal, loving family. the family residing with the so sees the good, bad and ugly for years. if the family has issues with the so, high chance it is a red flag for consideration.",Positive
"no, you can't get a unit under pphs if you're applying/ on the waitlist under public scheme.",Neutral

"if they can choose not to rush to bto already shows a level of matured mindset.of course flip side is they didn't think at all.if they didn't bto and simply be together for 5 years, they would have learnt more about each other rather than have a bto hanging over their heads locking them together.noted that penalty is lower in this case but even then, there would be those who hold on simply because bto already.this is more of a problem problem having a major commitment in a relationship when the couple isn't really ready for each other.",Positive
public scheme demand should be satisfied first before any flat are allocated to the pphs,Positive
for a bloody 2 room? rent from the open market. many fully furnished units there..mind u this is just double the rates people in rented hdb pay but have their household income capped at 1.5k,Negative
u act like they are suffering when they are the lucky ones. just double the normal subsidised  rental rates  for 2 room  without the 1.5k household income cap that others have.  they are undeserving of the flat with so little allocation when they can afford to rent in the open market. .,Positive
and u probably don’t qualify for subsidised rental,Neutral
"even if they can afford open market rental, it doesn’t mean that they should have to do that. they are only staying there temporarily due to bto delay. since hdb is unable to deliver the flats on time, they are being offered subsidised rental instead. is that so hard to comprehend?imagine waiting 5 years for your bto only  have it delayed for another god knows how long. have to move into temporary accommodations at additional cost and in not great condition. still need to get scolded for being undeserving lmao.",Negative
"yeah, but that's because i'm not singaporeanpro-tip, bitterness towards people who are more well-off then you is not a good look.",Positive
yes and why is it so heavily subsidised for people who can afford the open market?,Neutral
guess what. hdb rental units for low income  are in severe shortage with a 2 year waiting list. why are all the available flats not given to them instead?160 units for 2000 applicants. sound like a lottery to me . boo hoo for the rest i guess,Positive
i’m not in public housing but that’s beside the point. we have so many housing issues for the less fortunate. yet these couples are given priority?? foreigners usually don’t see the underclass of singaporeans living in rental flats cuz the blocks are exclusively singaporean.,Positive
can see all the downvotes but i agree with you. i do resent that these straight couples (who are probably not poor by any means) enjoy even privileges such as this... as though all the other privileges when it comes to housing are not enough. i would rather this generosity be poured into the truly needy instead.,Positive
"opportunity and money are two different things. what low income households need is money (eg. subsidies for rental be it under hdb or open market). that is not e same as giving them more opportunity to secure a flat. it’s like when you buy a bto or resale, you get grants if you’re under a certain income level but that doesn’t mean you should get additional chances to secure a house.",Positive
not quite sure where you are getting at. but housing is a basic need. the less well to do are way more deserving of rental flat than this couple .,Positive

"it is a misconception that there are a lot of people who rent for life in the us and germany. what happens is that most young people in those countries after leaving their parents' house will live on their own (often with room mate) in a rental apartment while in their 20's. it is also common for them to move from city to city for their career. during this phase of their life, it does not make sense for them to buy a house because things like agent fees and mortgages are expensive when you have a short credit history and a low salary. there is also no point buying a big empty place for you to live on your own. a small 1-bedroom, studio apartment or bedsit is enough and affordable to most young people. when they get married and settle down in a particular city to start a family, they usually are secure in their carreer and earning more. they then take up a mortgage to buy a place that is big enough for their family's needs. during this phase of their life, it is very difficult to make them move because of their family commitments. by 65, most married people in the us are house owners unless they are divorced or have had financial trouble (e.g. getting laid off). in singapore, most young people just live with their parents until they get married and buy a flat (resale or bto) because there is just no affordable apartment rental market. a large part  of your money is locked up in cpf and you cannot use it to rent a place.",Positive
"housing prices have gone up sharply because there is a temporary savings glut as people are spending less on other things such as holidays and eating out. there is also a greater demand for living space because of wfh arrangements in singapore. in addition, the rental market is saturated by demand from malaysian workers who are stranded in singapore and cannot go back to malaysia. the housing supply is also disrupted by the restrictions on construction workers coming into singapore. the cost of construction materials has also gone up.all these things will probably pass in two years' time when the pandemic is over and the housing prices will probably go down as demand and supply factors return to normal. in the mean time, do consider renting as an option in the meantime.the resale flat market is likely to soften in the medium term because we have large cohorts in the silver generation who will pass away and release their flats into the resale market. this will increase the supply of resale units and drive down prices.",Negative
"for your typical educated young couple, housing is definitely not out of reach if standards are set a bit lower (e.g. cck, smaller flat, stay with parents longer while waiting bto or to save up). however it's entirely true that we may see couples rent as a stepping stone, but for those that can stay at home that's an obvious preferred alternative (assumption being that of a sc couple staying with one side is viable). for this group, accruing two individuals' cpf from the start of working life means buying is both viable and preferred to using nett salary for cash.there is however a big portion of the spr population who are on blue collar/low-end white-collar work that face more difficulties in saving up and accessing hdb so they end up renting for longer periods already. not really sure what the long game looks like for this group tbh.",Positive
not for me...staying at my parent's house....lol,Positive
"don’t think so unless it becomes too expensive until it is out of reach for the majority. singaporeans see hdb as an asset, renting is equivalent to throwing money away unnecessarily. i have friends who rom still lives separately with their parents and not rent while waiting for their bto.",Negative
"owning a home may be a lifelong goal for many people but that doesn't mean it's for everyone. homeownership rates are currently high in singapore., but this hasn’t always been the case. families have historically needed to either build their own homes or rent a home from someone else. although it may not be ideal, renting does have its advantages, too. for some people renting might make more sense for their financial circumstances.searching for a new home can be overwhelming. figuring out how much you can reasonably spend on rent, choosing a location, and finding roommates all take time and energy. coliving has become a popular [alternative](https://adobha.com) to traditional housing options for renters looking to save money and build community.",Positive
cpf is obviously the biggest factor here,Neutral
yeah but do we have a choice? at this current trend the wait and price will keep going up...,Neutral
"better, but just because the other side is burning down doesnt mean we arent suffering. comparison like these makes many people feel ""better"" in swimming through shit just because ""others have it worse"", but theyre literally diving in poo.not saying to be like ""oh our lives are the worse we cant afford housing we cant afford food singapore is so expensive boo hoo"", just saying its okay to be upset that hey our housing is indeed expensive, but we can work through it, or find a way around it.",Positive
as someone who lives in cck i take umbrage at your comment /s,Neutral
"indeed... if the day ever comes that cpf is not allowed to be used to fund housing loans, then things will change. haha.",Positive
you will always have options in singapore even if it takes longer. i even saw this middle aged guy on youtube who does odd jobs that just took keys for his 2-room bto. most people do not buy in their 20s overseas either. stay at home to save up.. cai png everyday... and lower your standards.,Positive
"sorry man, but not everyone can afford queenstown ok",Negative
try get go - right now has some discount,Positive
"drive lah, it's more like a p2p car sharing platform (like airbnb) so you deal with car owners directly. good thing is, rentals are covered with insurance, and you have drive lah to handle diaputes just in case.i've tried it last christmas for 4 days, not too bad.",Positive
aye thanks man.... i just downloaded it just now... hopefully i'll get to try it soon,Positive
do you have a manual license?,Neutral
"yeap, i took class 3 just to have option between auto and manual",Neutral
cool! which manual car are you eyeing?,Positive
that's a smart thing to do.,Positive
"not sure at the moment, i heard lancer gearbox doesn't spoil easily so~ my few option atm are lancer, swift, vios, corolla and maybe sunny? in general i just prefer manual cars that has good comfort, not too small and low in maintenance cost",Negative
"i drove an old lancer for a good 7 years, generally hassle free and still feels damn good after 7 years, this was like between 2005 to 2012. love the shape,  love how spacious it is. i still miss it sometimes. had a friend who drive a vios and a colleague who drove a swift. all cannot compare to my lancer in terms of power, and general finishing. are you looking to buy a new car or old car? don't know how the cars are like now.",Positive
"currently i'm looking to buy old car, not that confident in having a long term commitment",Positive
first thing to do is obviously to approach the car rental company to explain your situation and try to seek a compromise.,Positive
"ask the car rental company if you're able to transfer the contract to another person, then find someone to take over the rental. u can help them top up about to encourage ppl to take up. hopefully it works out for you",Positive
"i have emailed and message the customer service but they have yet to get back to me. i checked during the cb period, they only gave rebates but didnt allow any return..",Neutral
"i’ve actually put out ads for relief driver but until now, nobody want to rent car, especially when cannot really go out also. abit tough..",Negative
hope you manage to work something out with them man. good luck and hang in there!,Positive
"hi! you might want to try out lumens auto. their excess below $1k and p-platers are welcome as well.else, you can try aka rentals or even hillview car rentals.",Positive
"hi, you can give motorist [https://www.motorist.sg/car-rental](https://www.motorist.sg/car-rental) a try, p plate friendly and can drive into malaysia too...",Positive
does lumens have hourly rental or they only go by day/s? and you happen to know the cheapest price? went to their website but they did not put any rates.,Neutral
"you have to contact them, a sales consultant will get to you.their daily rates are quite affordable, cheapest at 70/day.",Neutral
"ohhhh, have you personally tried renting their cars? how would you rate the car condition?",Neutral
"yes i have! they have a wide range of new and old cars.always kept in pristine condition and would personally recommend them because as a phv driver, your excess is only $200. not sure about p-platers but i'm sure they can work out something for you.they're very flexible people too.",Positive
"ohhhh, thanks man!on a side note, how much do you normally earn as a phv driver? i'm thinking of trying to rent car and try phv as a leisure hobby after my p plate is over, would u recommend?",Positive
"in the past quite a lot as an ft driver when uber was around. i was clocking 8h a day for 5 days and easily brought in 3k nett a month after rental and petrol charges. that was when i was still studying, and the money was good for uni days. plus you get a car. nowadays... it's really shit. you'd be happy if you can touch 3k nett at a 7 day work week, 12h a day. you'd be better off working part time outside. the liabilities are super high even with a rented car.if you want to do it part time, try smove, rent by the hour and drive. with the current situation, you'd be looking at max 15-20/hr nett at peak periods.my opinion is subjective though. there are some drivers out there saying still can earn - but then these are experienced drivers who make it a point to study the market, situations and events everyday - which i feel you can put to better use if you work a real ft job. at least you learn skills and can brighten up your resume along the way.",Positive
"ahhhhhh, that's nice of you to share this much, now i have a better understanding how phv job works, thanks man!",Positive
i used to use bkw rentals. good rate. no frills. nice local company feeling.,Positive
"you can fill a lawsuit or make a police report. i will assume the purpose of ""deposit"" is to ensure that if the car got into any accident, it will cover it and if the damage exceed the amount of deposit, you will need to add on. but from your case, the damage is below the repair cause so you should in fact be given the remaining amount back.",Negative
isn’t there some form of insurance?,Neutral
"the insurance he signed was “damage to vehicle, subjected to appended non-waiverable excess of $6000 for own damage claims” the thing is he already paid for his own damage but they cannot return the deposit because there was an accident (written in the contract).",Positive
"excess of 6000 is quite crazy! sounds like the whole car needs to be scrapped. is this a reputable car rental? after making good the damages, it should be considered “original state”? else there’s no need to make good, just forfeit the deposit. i think you can lodge it with case. highlight the lack of a customer copy of the contract as well as the deposit?",Positive
the company have good reviews. the excess is very high due to him being a p plate driver. he is requesting the contract tomorrow. after that part we will think of what to do!,Positive
👍🏼 all the best!,Positive
tribe car!,Neutral
bluesg is pretty good if you want to use it on demand.,Positive
"you can try tribecar. sometimes after midnight, the price drops to $1-$2 per hour. only downside is need at least 23 years old and 2 years of driving experience, or else have extra down payment of $100. another downside is maybe hard to get vehicle at your area.i personally feel bluesg is quite exp.",Negative
"true, 5min of bluesg is about $5 alreadyi have a tribecar vehicle about 5min walk from my house, but how is ur experience with tribecar so far?",Positive
it's quite affordable and the help desk is quite helpful when you face any problems!,Neutral
what about the cars in general?,Positive
your normal sedan cars. had a toyota wish before.,Positive
park at ikea tampines. lol,Positive
presumably you're not renting a car for 5 days to simply park it so you need calculate only the hours you don't use the car. how many hours is the car going to sit in a car park? night parking at hdb car parks is a flat fee (i think it's $4.00) so that saves a fair bit.  hope that helps.,Positive
if there is a place with coupon parking you can save a bit by getting a whole day coupon.  most places are electronic these days though.,Positive
hey thanks for the help. yeah i just found out my house has the 5 dollar over night parking.. i guess i'll have to pay the day rates as per normal... thanks,Positive
"oh... there is such a coupon? i will look into it, thanks!",Positive
"no worries, good luck.",Positive
"$12 per day, 7am to 7am next day. you can also use the parking.sg app to pay for it.",Neutral

maybe you would like to check out drivelah?,Neutral
you can try carlite. works like bluesg but more variety of cars available at cheaper rates. need to top up ur own petrol and use ur own cashcard tho. and to return it back at the same spot. minimal rental period is 15 mins.,Positive
thanks. actually i previously mistakenly thought drivelah is like bluesg but after looking at bit more i realized this is something completely different. did you any experience with that?,Positive
i will have a look on that. thanks!,Positive
"yes! it’s more like renting from car owners. i have tried, although price is on the higher side but at least the car won’t have the rental company sticker etc and u can do hourly or whole day rental etc. booking was a breeze through their system and car should be in good condition since it is owned by someone",Positive
"thanks, i tried it too, and my opinion is very positive. i had really nice couple as the owner. price was still decent, roughly the same as for normal hire, but i could pick up and drop off in the place near to me (as i could choose the car anywhere) and at time times that were convenient for me. i will definitely use that service more.",Positive
