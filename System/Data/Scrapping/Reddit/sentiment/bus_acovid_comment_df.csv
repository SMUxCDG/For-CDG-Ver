"> plenty of construction companies are heavily in the red now and also they have are operating on razor thin margins traditionallyyes of course covid is a black swan event but everyone else is also taking a hit. operating on razor thin margins isn't really an excuse to treat workers like cattle. like i said, they are free to pass the cost on, since its not as significant as the other drivers of increasing property prices. this isn't the only issue that sector is facing because i think they may also be facing a labour shortage due to workers returning back to their countries or stuck in dorms. if the entire sector is a house of cards that got blown away by a pandemic, is it really sustainable? something's gotta give.",Positive

oh shit i got called out on the internet.well played old man,Positive
same reason. the bus is there to ‚Äúmask‚Äù the transportation of recruits because they might be transporting during no-move time. the no-move time exists because the saf is afraid of complains from the slow driving by the saf drivers.great that the recruits are in a more comfortable ride. i enjoyed it myself too but there must be some kind of award for this kind of stupidity. god forbid singaporean drivers give way to military transport.,Positive

"no, it's like asking if you want to live in hdb or sleep in an underpass. no other industry transports their employees with lorries. even blue collar factory workers have shuttle buses to bring them from the mrt station. what makes the construction industry so privileged?",Positive
most prob no other industry own that many lorry/pick up that they can utilize it for transport. /shrug u want to compare then compare it something suitable not like underpass where it‚Äôs not livable environment. don‚Äôt go to the extreme just to make your point sound more justifiable‚Ä¶,Positive
just to clarify i‚Äôm not in construction industries nor am i defending employers that force employer to sit in pickup with no covers or with construction material that will pose safety issue. but like i said since young i‚Äôm sit at the back of pickup and lorries and it‚Äôs been a fine experience without any safety issue unless the driver is racing then the pickup will shake a bit. other than that it‚Äôs quite safe and a fun experience at that.,Positive
"that's not a justification, that's a means. i said 'why should construction companies be allowed to cut costs at the expense of their employees?' and you replied with 'because they can do it easily.'i don't see how my comparison is unfair. an underpass is about as suitable for shelter as a lorry is for human transport.",Positive

you're the one making excuses for why construction companies can lack basic human decency.,Neutral
buses are designed to minimise impact in the event of an accident. they are designed for safe human transport. lorries are not.your one anecdote of riding in a lorry as a child and enjoying it is akin to someone saying they've never caught the flu so why should they wash their hands.,Positive
human decency? lmao like lorry are not design to be a vehicle for transport?,Neutral
designed? i don‚Äôt know about that but from recent picture of the bus crashing into the bus stop barrier it doesn‚Äôt look like it survive any better if they ain‚Äôt design to be so. again seat belt isn‚Äôt going to save u nor the specifically design bus mitigation damage it is design to be.,Positive
again u are picking something out of context and compare it to something that isn‚Äôt relevant. honestly are u capable to digress a point and compare it to something else suitably? u sound like just trying too hard to justify your argument.,Positive

feels like ux design is often neglected in singapore. the old ui of the mrt led screen comes to mind.,Positive
agreed. the 'next' bus stop should be at the top and the ones after below it. like a cascading flow. the final stop could display 'ends' or 'terminates' at wherever it ends. everytime i take a bus with this display i have to do a double take to ensure i've not missed my stop. buses with the simple design- the ones with the next stop and bus stopping display on the celling of the bus- is easier to understand.,Positive

this is one of the 50 hybrid buses! i always see them on sbs 93 and smrt 859. really nice feel with the colours and bright interior but pity the number of seats at the front half of the bus.,Positive
"actually loving how futuristic it looks. and tbf 93 is on a route that's not _that_ high volume? so maybe that's why they chose to use this bus on the 93 route. that said, i sometimes take 93 cos i live along the route to get to one of my tutee's place and it's such a smooth ride.",Positive

i love seating there cuz it's close to the driver's pov with unobstructed view haha. also no need squeeze.,Positive
"personally i wouldn't have mind full electric but there are many factors on why they are not better than hybrid/regular/hydrogen fuel cell buses. the fact that they run out of battery faster than petrol/diesel is rather inefficient and the infrastructure needed to accomodate it. lastly, the source which may be fossil fuels.",Positive
"yep, with 3 steps up at the entrance and no wheelchair access. there are trade-offs to make in creating a more inclusive transport network with low-floor buses, not to mention hybrid/electric buses (this one's a hybrid) which will need some additional space for batteries.",Positive
not sure how much of an increase you would like for it to be enough for you? peak hour we don‚Äôt really wait more than 2-3 mins already. i think the bigger problems here are train faults and the mentality of mad passengers that insist on getting on a fully packed mrt when the next one is in 2 minutes,Positive
handicap access too,Neutral
"so far only smrt spec-ed buses (except for the oc500le aka the green mercedes single deck with more spacious interior) have the folding seats. as for the lta spec buses (the buses which do not use the usual sbs colour scheme for seats aka yellow and red or smrt's red purple and blue colour scheme), all of them have this folding seattheres also a green 3 door double decker on 7 with multi coloured led signage and black front that also has folding seats at the lower deck. that bus usually leaves clementi for bedok at around 6pm on weekdays",Negative
i've seen the bus captains in my area telling old folks to fold down the seats when there isn't any empty seats left for them! hopefully more people will catch on,Positive

"for a lot of folks, sch and ns gave a reason for pple to hang out with them and they happen to become friendsin working life / uni you dont have this shit, you actually need to take the initiative to get to know someone on a deeper levelits less about singaporean society but more about coming to the realization most people are not interesting enough for a stranger to want to know you. alternatively you can hang on to old friendships but those become tested when you no longer have a reason to spend time together",Positive
eventually some familiar passengers will board the bus again. some will ask for free ride.some will try sell you something.some will carjack your bus.some will stab your back.some will brag their new cool ride.some will try to convert you.some will want to network.some will be curious what happen to you.some just bored.so which one are you?,Positive
"one of the great heartbreaks you have in life is when you realise most friendships, even the ones you hold most dear to your heart, are temporary. it's part of growing up. people's lives move in different directions and it's only natural for that to put a strain on your friendships. just remember that those people probably miss you too, and just because they aren't around anymore doesn't mean they don't care. i've lost more good friends due to growing up than i care to list but i know we'll always be in each other's thoughts from time to time.",Positive

"i think many have resigned themselves to just drive by the stops using your analogy.realistically, who cares about the bus drivers anyway, people just get on and get off.keep the doors closed, keep on driving~",Positive
"this analogy really sounds stressful to me. i feel some people hit it off with friends so easily while it's a struggle for me to maintain acquaintances. it's hard enough for me to keep my bus running on the road safely, let alone trying to keep those passengers on the bus.",Positive
"this is very bleak and rather crap; i'm sorry if you're not in a good place currently that's causing you to draw on this metaphor. i just don't think that's how it should be.while it's true that not every ""friend"" will be with you for a long time, there will (and should) be real friends who will always be happy to give you the time of the day when you need them, even if you haven't seen them in a while. there are people i've not seen in years but i know will be happy to meet up with me without any conditions, and i'd do the same for them.i do suggest posting something like this in a different sub (do try to follow the rules so it doesn't get removed); a different perspective outside of our country's bubble might help you re-think on how best to make and keep friends.",Positive
"i see a lot of people that spend a huge amount of time on their phones. even out with friends - they're looking down at their phones. if you don't take the time to build these deeper connections then you can't really expect a deeper friendship. deep friendships happen through shared experiences and a better understanding of each other. for that people need to actually talk to each other, do things they wouldn't normally do, and live a little. put your phones away and see what happens. or don't. peace",Positive
would like to add on also. some passengers just happened to reach their destinations or are going towards another direction that is totally not aligned with your bus route (planned or unplanned). there's no point staying on the same bus then and they actually need to transfer to another bus or even another mode of transportation to carry on their journeys.,Neutral
"at the end of the day, what matters are the very same passengers that have stood by the bus, in various weather conditions and held onto the handrails tightly whenever there were bumps along the journey. even if it turns out to be a lonely bus ride, at the very least there's a simple serenity to it. enjoy your own company.",Positive
"some passengers after boarding will litter and put their legs up on your chairs, some will argue with other passengers or complain about you the bus driver behind your back. the earlier you let these drama queens off the bus the better.",Negative
">accepting that passengers will alight sooner or later.this nearly made me cry. this is such a bleak take lol.i prefer the similar idea that everyone is on their own journey - but nobody knows to where. some paths cross multiple times, some paths run parallel, some touch each other once and then never again.[relevant song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez98ij0usoe)>you go there you're gone forever>i go there i'll lose my way>if we stay here we're not together>anywhere is",Positive
"i recently decided to abandon a friend after he lied and twisted facts too many times to keep up his gd sob story. thought it‚Äôd have lasted through uni but oh well, the transient nature of friendship made me even more lonely anyway.",Positive
"damn this hit hard. you thought you‚Äôve finally found someone that you‚Äôre comfortable enough to confide to and is mutual, but sadly good things usually don‚Äôt last forever. one day, one month, half a year goes by and before you know it it dissipates just like that for no reason. time passes by so fast. you initiate contact but you can tell from the conversation that it was no longer what it used to be.sometimes the most hurtful thing is when you come to the realisation that the person has long moved on while you haven‚Äôt. you wonder if both of you will cross paths again, but deep down you know the chances are slim to none. you wonder if you‚Äôll meet someone like that again, and at the back your mind you‚Äôre scared if you don‚Äôt. but alas, this is life and some things are not meant to last. you can only accept fate and move on. you hope time will heal everything.",Negative
"wow this is a really great way to look at it, would give u gold if i could haha.",Positive
"i always believe strangers (and thus friends) come into our lives for a reason. this could be to teach us life lessons or to act as companions and enrich our lives. however, the underlying point i want to make is that we shouldn't be forcing any of this friendships. strangers might have entered our lives at different phases of our lives and sometimes its really just best to leave things as it is. we might have connected then but that doesn't mean we are going to be friends for life. i cherish the friends that have moved on over the years...yes i do remember the good times we had together..but i also understand that the only thing that matters now is the present because the rest of it will just stay as memories. so instead of me being the bus driver... i think we are all passengers on the bus.. some of us alight and go on to different paths and thats okay.",Positive

"another interesting analogy is that life is a stage, and we're all main characters in our own lives.some people may be the supporting cast, meaningful in your life, but never having a huge role in it.some may be other main characters, the hero and the heroine. the band of brothers. frodo and sam.some, and if not most, will be the calefare, with little to no interaction.some will be the antagonist, others, the protagonist.and the lover of your life, for that happily ever after.you are the jack sparrow, ethan hunt, and geralt of rivia, as is everyone else in their lives.more importantly, you are the director. so choose your cast wisely, if you want your show to be a spectacle. direct the plot as interestingly as you can.all the world's a stage!",Positive

"i just have to say that your 2nd last paragraph is totally not linked to the analogy, but just mentioned in passing. different people have different definition of friends, hell even your definition of friends will change. my definition of friends is simple ‚Äî someone for you to use... the meaning itself is deep enough and works 2 fold. if you have no one to use, do consider that you do not have any friends (in that issue). whatever the issue is, be it time, advice, company, money, blindspot, ups or downs, etc, its up to individuals. conversely this apply the other way round, which of your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù will you allow them to use you. so trying to fit it into your analogy, if your bus breaks down, do the passenger alight and go for another bus, or help you with the trouble shooting.",Negative

it's harder to foster relationships but not impossible. you just gotta be more realistic and keep the people that you want to keep and let others go. i don't really have that many people i stay in contact with because i've shedded most of the people that i'm not that close to. so i can say with full certainty that almost all the people in my chat groups are my close friends who would care if anything were to happen to me.,Positive

"tldr: in a perfect world, if two buses stop for a set period of time at a bus stop and leave at the same time, everything goes as planned on paperbut in a world like ours where perfection is a lie, the earlier bus gets delayed a bit, the bus stops ahead of it will accumulate more people, means they will have to stop even longer to let more people on and off, therefore becoming more delayed and the cycle goes on. meanwhile the bus behind, since the bus in front left later and thus cleared more people, the bus at the back has lesser and lesser people to pick up so it has to stop less and less, skipping stops even. a vicious cycle in the opposite direction of the first occurs. eventually the two will catch up with each other. now throw in more buses, peak period and heavy traffic like in the video and you can get a daisy chain of the same bus service",Positive

"somehow you still don‚Äôt seem to get it. it‚Äôs not that gps is not right, its the fact that you think a free app with an ad based model can somehow be a sustainable enough business model to install gps‚Äôs on every single bus and maintain them, not to mention somehow have the network infrastructure to be able to send the data to some centralised system.lta doesn‚Äôt make money on this, they can do this because they are a government organisation providing a public service. no company could ever realistically do this by themselves.and yes, i actually work at lta. i know how the system works. it‚Äôs not some simple system that anyone could cook up. the system is dependent on a customised 3g band that is set up by the local telcos explicitly for this. i didn‚Äôt want to go into the specifics of it as i don‚Äôt expect others to have such in depth knowledge of this, but even without it you can quite easily see how such a system is unfeasible just by simple economics.even the link that you posted shows this:>	moovit has two ways to get the rt data. the first is the integration of estimated time of arrivals (etas) that are calculated by the ‚Äúprovider‚Äù which usually refers to the transit agency. the second case is where the provider gives the geographic position of a vehicle (gps data) and moovit calculates the etas to the next stops using moovit‚Äôs specialized algorithm.here, provider (or transit agency) refers to the lta equivalent of that country exposing the data through their specific api. this app literally works the same way all our bus apps work, by coordinating with the local agency‚Äôs api...at this point, i can clearly see that you are out of your depth. you don‚Äôt seem to have sufficient technical knowledge to be able to reason about any of this. but the point of my post wasn‚Äôt even to argue the technical aspects of it and more about your argument itself. you keep saying that its pedantic to attack your poor examples when your arguement at its crux is just a disprove by counterexample. you are trying to disprove the claim that the bus apps work through lta api by providing a counter example of how it could work without it. do you still not see why it doesn‚Äôt hold up? the criticisms are everything other than pedantic, in fact, they are literally attacking the proposition itself.",Negative

"can confirm. ltc/sltc is where exit outcomes diverge the most based on the regulars i know. you have farmer guys who planned their exit strategy shrewdly with smart investments, learning about the outside world and networking, so they adjusted well to the new inter-personal dynamic, got into a good job (ie. in the corporate world not propped up by proximity to saf: ie. not languishing in st) and had money to maintain a very comfortable lifestyle. you also have guys that flounder and get outcomes that don't seem commensurate with the rank and power they previously achieved over so many men. the problem is when you haven't been promoted enough or rotated across a diverse range of appointments that give you a chance to interact beyond the saf silo, and you never made the effort to seek it out yourself. this is exacerbated by the age; unlike cpt/maj, you didn't leave quite early enough to build a second career as relatively easily, there is a lot of lost time and stagnation in skills and exposure to make up for as time went you by in the saf. a lack of humility, myopic worldview and general ignorance makes it worse. if anything, that distinguishes the exiting ltcs/sltcs that make it and are not defined by their army service, from those that continue their streak of mediocrity from the saf.at the col/bg level, you would typically be exposed enough to broader policy and matters outside the saf in the course of your work sufficiently to transition painlessly, even if its just a senior position somewhere adjacent like st. even more so if you're a scholar and/or seconded elsewhere. arguably, you are that rank *precisely* because someone trusts you in that position of exposure and operating across a broad domain, and you are given significantly more *institutional support* for the transition because the powers that be *want you* to be in higher positions for the sake of continuity, predictability and channelling your skills and experience down a path that gives you the best chance of exercising them.",Positive

i've seen some grab delivery peeps do this.,Neutral
"don't think so tho, face shields were banned as it was reasoned that they don't cover the face tight enough and bandannas aren't much better in that regard. also our gov gave out masks to everyone for free so there's no excuse in that sense. the us had (has?) a shortage of face masks, so they just recommended a face coveringof course if you're stuck in a bus without a mask and worse comes to worse then you gotta make do",Negative

"just had some on monday, it‚Äôs really not bad. chicken is juicy and well seasoned, so it‚Äôs savoury and slightly spicy. texture is kind of like the mcwings but crispier. not crispy until hard that kind of texture",Positive
i hate the new mccrispy. they don't have the sweet chili sauce and crummy superhero cartoon. the taste is spicier and doesn't match well with mcd garlic chili. (i'm ok with spicier but not ok with no sweet chili sauce.wish to relive the past... gets icky feeling.i remembered this around 99/00. when mcd is still 'fast food' ambience with white light and uncomfortable chairs.doesn't matter. make this right mcd. bring back the sauce.https://eatbook.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chicken-mccrispy-mcdonalds.jpg,Positive

i prefer mcwings for sure. the flavour is off for this one.,Positive

"the one most useful thing to me is being able to click on a bus stop and see where all the buses go from there, so i have the best chance to work out which i need. i've not done an exhausive search, but things like moovit and google maps only let me click on each separate route and try to work it out one at a time.yours just showed me all of them going from my local stop. it's awesome. i love it.",Positive

"signboard says $12 per head. takes 4 passengers to go. the one in the center backseat the most uncomfortable la.... imagine sharing with strangers. but usually is with people you know la.i took it once back when it was $10 per head. shared with a partner, we ‚Äúbao-ed‚Äù the taxi for 4x $10 ($12 nowadays per signboard)i think i took the my teksi (there are also some singapore comfort cab but they need to apply some special license/tag to ferry passengers across the causeway and strictly that fixed route only.) same thing, past customs as any private vehicle and drop you off. i can‚Äôt remember which terminal it stopped. i guess the my teksi more hiong, dare to stop anywhere la.iirc, once past 7pm, very few service cabs at the terminal already. i don‚Äôt think the my cabbies want to stay in sg also. most will be queuing for the bus services since the frequency is faster. don‚Äôt know about customs clearance though. haha.the my cabbies all got wear uniform one. white top shirt. i remember seeing one vintage merc (one of a kind in the cp) they also like to lepak around waiting for passengers back then.",Positive
probably doing normal taxi service now,Positive
would be great if we could compile comparison pics of different places. like 2019 vs 2021,Positive

what happens if you get stuck in a 2hr jam or something? same price?,Neutral
ah i see. thanks for sharing!,Positive
"this is in sg? i legit thought this is malaysia. the way it was structure and place, looks malaysian to me. something like booking taxi just outside jb central.",Neutral
time to create a half blood taxileft side sg right side mythen can park anywhere liao,Positive
should be the same and factored in already. that‚Äôs probably why they (my teksis) don‚Äôt take the peak hour routes (knock off timings unless they too are going back). i‚Äôm pretty sure their counterparts at the jb terminal station will feedback on traffic.the buses already cater to the migrant workers who transit daily and maximise their earnings. the cabs are more for privacy and comfort. $3.30 (bus) vs $12 taxi is almost 4x. definitely not for the everyday migrant worker. just like an entry level admin taking grab to work everyday. hahaha.,Positive
"well the structure has been like that for donkey years. just one shelter and an altar behind. the cabbies lepak below some trees/bushes just along the fence beside which separates the parking bay from a church. there is a primary school just across which is soon giving way since it it merging and shifting to another premise in 2023.the once colourful rochor center hdb flats was also just opposite, been demolished since 2018.there is also an old skool cobbler just at the corner of the bus queue. further down was where the sungei road thieves market was. closed since 2017.",Positive

"meantime, we should continue to report, celebrate and encourage such deed of kindness.",Neutral
"only when it becomes news can people see the good that happens tho. otherwise, tragedy sells.",Positive
"i understand what you‚Äôre saying but i disagree. imagine when we turn on the news or open the newspapers, and there‚Äôs only murders, frauds, drugs and wars being told to us. all the negativity won‚Äôt be good to our mental health.so both *doing* and *reporting* good deeds should be normalised.",Positive
"yes, good news is the best news!",Positive

there is a bus 972 captain who does this too.,Neutral
"i've gotten on this guy's bus before a month ago, also 174 around lunchtime towards chinatown area. he wasn't announcing every single stop but he definitely was greeting every one individually as they got on the bus, and thanking those alighting.so it appears he does this on the regular, if not every day. man deserves recognition and a raise!it was nice seeing people thanking him back! but also a bit depressing seeing some others just showing poker asshole face and not acknowledging him at all. ffs don't need to open mouth and just nod head also can right?",Positive
quality service driver we need. we need more bus drivers like him for a more relaxing bus atmosphere.,Positive
so cute this uncle,Neutral
"if only they install pids, then the captain can save some energy announcing stops",Neutral
i met him before! was a really early like 6am bus and he greeted everyone with good morning as we boarded. made my day at least.,Positive
smile that comes from the heart will go a long way. wonder how long has he been working as a sbs bus captain and still maintain his smile. kudos to him and a model for all service industries.,Positive
give this man a pay raise!,Neutral
"i havent seen him lately, is he still on 972?",Neutral
"lol! poker asshole faces! those faces are probably the same people who pretend to sleep/on the phone in the bus/train when an elderly walks passed. giving them the benefit of the doubt, they could be deaf or maybe mentally challenged so just forgive them.",Positive

or those people who sit on the aisle side of the 2nd floor during rush hour with an empty seat beside them and refusing to let people sit (because they don't like to sit beside others),Negative
im so sorry for what happened to you but yeah singaporeans tend to be as indifferent as possible as most of us do not want to get into unnecessary troubles. i think it is better for you to travel with a friend next time if you feel unsafe.,Positive
"that sucks, hopefully you won't experience it ever again in singapore. some of the uncles and aunties here can really be doing some messed up shit without any set back/punishment. be safe during these times.",Positive
"good job for speaking up for yourself. if i were there, i‚Äôd definitely help a sista out. unfortunately i find that most singaporeans have a hands-off, ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù attitude towards anything that doesnt directly affect them.",Positive
"that sucks. in such cases, i would suggest that you instantly make a call to the police. i know it‚Äôs a lot of hassle. it‚Äôs so frustrating to hear that no one stood by you but unfortunately, that‚Äôs how a vast majority of the people behave here. i hope you don‚Äôt have to run into such issues again",Negative
"whoa that's insane. i'm sorry that it happened to you and no one came to your aid. please don't lose hope. something similar happened to me on the train when i was still in school. my ride home passes through some of the underground stations and in those instances you can see really well what's on the opposite side's screen. imagine my surprise seeing my own image reflected on the window. he denied it when i confronted him, and same as in your situation, he said he's just playing with his phone. thankfully another passenger grabbed the man's phone and used it as bait to get him off at the next station where we went to the smrt concierge. police was called and the man was forced to unlock his phone and show the camera roll which lo and behold had me among many other school girls pictures. can't remember what happened next because i just wanted to get home. instead the kind passenger said he'll talk to the police etc. they did take my information down but i don't remember being reached out to. my point is, please don't lose hope in the system. best is if you could inforn the smrt/sbs on duty as they're obligated to step in and at least call the authorities.",Positive
fight fire with fire... video them back next time,Neutral
someone touched my right boob on the bus once and i shouted at him. the people on the bus looked at me as if i was the crazy one.,Negative
"i had an ex boyfriend who would stalk me from school/work after we broke up to try to convince me to get back together. whenever he reached the point where he realized he couldn‚Äôt convince me, he would spend the time getting frustrated and raising his voice at me telling me i‚Äôm a horrible/mean/fake/stupid person... all the way home. he raised his voice right by my face in the bus - everyone pretended not to notice. i guess singaporeans don‚Äôt really step in because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmind your own business‚Äù society",Negative
"wow i‚Äôm really surprised. where did you take the bus from ? should take a picture of the old pervert. i‚Äôm disgusted by those on the bus and would like to apologise on their behalf. we singaporeans ought to do something in situation like this. if in any situation you feel harassed i think you should call the police. our bus drivers are also trained to handle situations like this. even if the police can‚Äôt officially charge him, they probably will make sure he delete those photos or maybe uncover more evidence in his phone. step up, seek help and call the authorities should the situation be appropriate",Positive
"i am so sorry for your experience. we are brought up largely to be told to stay away from danger and avoid getting involve into trouble with others, this sadly did not consider the need to stand up against what is wrong. the good news is things are gradually changing. more and more people from the younger generation are standing up against others' wrongdoing. but this will take sometime before it becomes common in the country.meanwhile, do stay safe and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. bus drivers are trained to handle such situation. if you feel that you are being harassed in a bus, you can walk up to the bus driver and inform him about the situation. the driver has a specific sop to follow when such situation arises. similarly, any public areas, if you found yourself to be in danger, ask for help from a stranger, walk quickly towards a service counter and tell them about it. someone will be there to help you.",Negative
"very sorry to hear that you have had such an uncomfortable situation, with such unwarranted treatment. i agree that singaporeans are largely very non-confrontational, and when most people are still processing what is going - many will not come forward to express an opinion or will simply look on with much curiosity. (harassment in public occurs very rarely, based on my observations..so maybe everyone was very uneasy and unsure about how best to react.) i do think there are still, however, opinionated and deeply compassionate people in singapore. as an asian i had experienced racist verbal abuse or unsolicited yellow fever advances several times when i was living overseas; and nobody spoke up or came to my defence...(except one very kind british old man), so i‚Äôm sorry to hear. i remembered thinking ‚Äúmaybe they just saw me as the minority and foreigner, and could not empathise, or they were unable to perceive how uncomfortable i am because of cultural differences‚Äù. i know that if i were there and saw your discomfort, i‚Äôd have spoken up for you - especially if you were a foreigner",Negative
"welcome to singapore. this reminds me of that time my friend passed out in the bus packed with students. we were on our way to school actually, and he fell unconscious due to immense stress from school. you could hear a loud thud as he fell to the ground.i was right beside him, and my first thought was to get him out of the bus and call an ambulance. i tried to carry him but i couldn‚Äôt on my own. i was clearly struggling with him and his schoolbag, trying to lift him off the floor with the bus still moving.at this point, i was panicking and all the people around me were just looking. it made me furious actually. i shouted across from the back of the bus to stop the vehicle. i asked very loudly to the person in front of me to help me carry him out of the bus and even then he hesitated to help. out of 30~ people in the bus,nobody helped to ask the driver to stop the bus.nobody helped to carry him out of the bus.(until i shouted at that one person)nobody helped to carry his schoolbag out of the bus. nobody helped to call an ambulance.nobody even offered to help.it was like i wasn‚Äôt even there. i really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with our upbringing. why are we so hesitant to help? are we shy to extend a helping hand? are we scared? or are we really assholes who can‚Äôt be bothered?",Negative
"i‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. indeed it was an unpleasant and horrible experience. singapore actually has many old perverts and it‚Äôs something shameful. if i were there i would have scolded the old man. many of the times people are afraid to speak up as they want to mind their own business, which is quite selfish to a certain extent",Positive
"rip, you've encountered the old perv uncle instead of the nice uncles. i've had such an encounter before too... it was deeply disturbing. however, my story has a good end thanks to kind samaritans. imagine it's the morning rush hour. people fill the bus at every stop. you got the side view seat and start to daydream while looking outside the window. then you get this eery vibe (spider-sense!) and turn to see a man that looked like he was in his twenties facing your direction. he just stares at you with a fixed expression. seconds become minutes and the uncomfortable reality sets in that he was doing it purposefully. the intentions remain unclear, and yet it feels threatening. when you try to hide your face behind a person, he moves just slightly to his left to get a clear view of... you. you can feel his eyes piercing through you as you struggle in the seat to find a haven. luckily for you, an sia flight attendant came on the bus and has gotten a gist of what was happening. she blocks the view, only to realise the view has now changed to her. tension rises when she realises she was the next target. fortunately, a muscular man, despite being slightly shorter, stood in between her and the perv. he had noticed what was happening and stepped in. that's when the perv gave up and turned away. a while after, he alights from the bus and the stressful tension instantly vanishes. phew! shoulders around me relax, and that's when i realised i wasn't alone. the hero and heroine now stood in a more relaxed posture, and so did the ""bystanders"". i was really glad that this crowd was filled with good and brave people. please don't lose hope op, know that good people still exist in singapore! i believe, at difficult times, singaporeans will not hesitate to lend a helping hand. i sincerely hope you won't experience smt this terrible ever again. #sgstayunited",Positive
"aww man im so so sorry... film that fucker and report him to the police! i don‚Äôt want to generalise, but its usually these aunties and uncles that give everyone a hard time. sorry everyone was so indifferent, it‚Äôs a really bad problem here",Negative
"i am really sorry you had to deal with it alone, no one should have to go through that. i hate to say it but some times singaporeans are afraid to step up to help. i promise you not all of us are like that. plus early in the morning, they just want to rush to work or wherever they need to be. i know it's not an excuse but i can assure you that we are better than that.",Negative
"when i was 14, i experienced a situation where the same creepy guy boarded the same bus i took to and from school several times. it started out with him sitting next to me on a completely empty bus and staring at me (my entire bus ride was 45mins long, i got off after 15mins) and subsequently i caught him trying to stand near me and once even taking a picture of me. sad to say, 10 years later things don't change - creepy guys still exist in public that make women uncomfortable üôÑ but the only thing we can change is how we stand up to these people and show them women are not to be bullied.",Negative
"good job for speaking up! a lot of people here will do things, with the expectation that no one says anything. then if you do raise your voice they will flip out and get defensive. we take sexual harassment very seriously here, so it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre speaking out. because everyone else would have also been thinking it in the bus. i‚Äôve been in situations where i‚Äôve clearly needed help -eg fell, dropped stuff- and a lot of people will just look, and think ‚Äúoh someone else will help‚Äù, then just walk away after like starting for three seconds. the bystander affect is really bad here.",Positive
"something similar happened to me on the bus, while i was going to work early one morning. the guy was sitting behind me and was resting his hand ever so slightly on my waist from between the seats. i thought my skirt had ridden up or something and reached down to fix it and touched this sicko‚Äôs hand. turned around, and he was pretending to be asleep - so i stood up and pushed him in the chest and postively yelled, ‚Äúwtf are you trying to do? stop pretending!‚Äù the four other people on the bus with us just looked steadfastly forward and pretended not to hear. like you said, it made me feel like the crazy one yelling her head off on a quiet bus at 7 in the morning. i think my heart was still beating fast even when i got into the office. sheesh!",Negative
"hi! sorry this is very late. it happened to me too. i was on a mostly empty bus except for a family of 4, me and this crazy dude. the dude started singing randomly and then come up to my seat and sang to my face and i had to scream stop at him, it was so scary. the dad in the family didn‚Äôt even help me, he only screamed at him when the dude did the same thing to his daughters. it was embarrassing and scary for me that nobody else will help me, not even the bus driver. i, like you has lost faith and that moment tells me that i need to learn self defence to protect myself. it also tells me that we as woman have to look out for other woman too and not be so selfish as what our culture has made it okey to let this kinds of things go by.",Negative
"bruh we suck man i dont and have never understood the concept of ‚Äúnot getting involved‚Äù when shit is happening, shit needs to be resolved bruh this is disgusting and i am so so sorry this happened ugh im so mad bruh",Negative
"my ex colleagues got their photo taken by a pervert uncle before. i went up to him and to bait him i said im reporting you to the police right now, let the police handle this and he got rattled. then he said theres nothing on my phone! im like - fker. i didnt say anything about phone. then i straight up unleashed a slew of curses at him till he was shaking and made him show me the photos. he denied at first , then i said , fine let the police check. he finally yielded and passed me his phone. i deleted the images and said to him "" if i ever see you doing this again, i'll make sure it will be worse. "" saw him a few times at the same place - tpy - he quickly walked away. chinese uncle usually in polo tee with a flip phone, hope he has changed his ways. another time was an uncle masturbating in bus 74, probably posted this story elsewhere. lazy to retype. fyi , im not a tall mascular guy. im like 160+ and chubby. lol. my ex colleagues didnt expect me to be the one confronting the uncle , there were guys there with like 170+ height and gymmed bodies lol. also , i wont say im a white knight because i like looking at pretty ladies too, but i just appreciate and dont do weird things. lol.",Positive
people don‚Äôt just board 89e. it cost more then regular 89. i‚Äôm going on a hunch to say he works in loyang or in the airfreight terminal. this means chances of seeing him again on the same service is high.,Positive
"i am done. once i hear this, i don't believe singaporean care about mine. maybe there's someone who probably can stand up protecting others but only few i doubt everyone will change their ""not my problem"" behaviour so i will protect myself",Negative
whats funny is that if this happened to a man people may not show the same amount of carealso that if the dude who pointed his camera at you tries to produce some evidence against your claim i swear there will be idiots who side with him,Negative
"if you ever deal with people like this, take their picture and talk to the driver or police. don't loose faith, still plenty of good people in singapore, just not confrontational it seems.singapore needs to buck up. be the change. what happens to all that military training? power in numbers. if just one person stood with her, this guy would have shriveled. be that person.",Positive
well honestly it's just the culture here in asia tbh,Positive
"in singapore, people do that as they don't wanna get involved and they are afraid that they may appear online or shamed for doing the wrong thing. most of them has the kiasi attitude (meaning scared to die - aka afraid to get in trouble). really frustrating i get that. but well in this kind of situation, u really did the right thing to speak up, maybe u should have fought fire with fire take pic or video of the guy taking photo of u and go report to the police. seriously this kinda pervert should just be charged and learn a lesson, still acting like he is right omg",Positive
"sorry to hear about your unpleasant encounter. camera tilted and you saw your face on screen? this sounds familiar. my cousin just related the same issue to me. it was her first few days at work as an intern and her female colleague sitting beside her stealthily did that. when my cousin discovered it, she reported the incident to her superior. her superior immediately informed hr and the girl was told to surrender her hp for checking. they didn‚Äôt find any pic of my cousin in it or any weird pics in the hp so they just let her off with a warning. my cousin had her seat changed. that‚Äôs how office personnel will be protected.i‚Äôm sure many aren‚Äôt aware of the seriousness of such an issue and hence prefer sitting on the fence. hope you feel better now.",Positive
"i‚Äôm so so sorry that happened to you :( hope you‚Äôre feeling okay. it‚Äôs happened to me multiple times too, and no one helped me either except for one auntie who offered to sit beside me on the bus to block the uncle‚Äôs view (on the bus). i really hope singaporeans would step up to help other people who may encounter such situations, if feels horrible dealing with it alone. also, report it to the police next time, just call the police on the spot if the perpetrator denies (but you know it happened). we need to catch and shame all these disgusting perverts so that they never dare to resurface and commit the same acts again. sending you love!! good on you for being brave and speaking out for yourself :)",Positive
i‚Äôm sorry this happened. it‚Äôs strange to me why the other people didn‚Äôt help you. this isn‚Äôt normal.,Negative
"when my ex was physically abusing me in public, no one did anything. a 180cm guy basically screaming, hitting and yelling at me but no one stopped him. i couldn‚Äôt even run away from him cause he would literally chase me down, no one did anything & they just stopped and stared. i think someone eventually called the police, but i wish someone had helped me out. i was young and naive and thought nothing could be done, that i was unlucky to be in my situation. or as my  poly ‚Äúfriends‚Äù would say, i deserved it for being in a abusive relationship.i swear on my grave that from that day on, if i see shit like that, if anyone men or woman looked like they were in the same situation as me or worse, i would lend a helping hand. i can‚Äôt imagine what you went through op. but i would have backed you up and not make you feel like you‚Äôre the crazy one.",Negative
"so sorry to hear that. in this case you suppose to take the photo of the perv and report to the bus captain. if he alight, write down the bus stop and the time. report to police. i am sure police will deal with him. if he is perv like you say, police will find the evidence in his phone.",Positive
i‚Äôve had some foreign workers take turns to sit next to me and snap photos from across the train (train wasn‚Äôt full). like they‚Äôd sit next to me and smile and their friends wld snap a photo right across from me. i changed a cabin after i caught on. later i called the police to ask what i could do and they said i could only make a magistrate‚Äôs complaint but not much could be done and it wasn‚Äôt illegal really. sad reality of life.,Positive
"sorry for your experience, but yea honestly it‚Äôs not singaporean‚Äôs culture to stand up when things like this happen..",Negative
"8 ,z",Neutral
don't mind if i ask but what country are you from?,Neutral
i‚Äôm really sorry that this had to happen but why don‚Äôt you complain to the police? i think they might be able to find the guy.,Positive
üò†,Neutral
"sadly it's become the culture here in singapore now. ignore and pretend like you saw nothing. don't get involved. didn't use to be like this. people used to be more outspoken about things. kids used to get scolded on the bus when they're rowdy/noisy. everyone's always so scared nowadays. i'll never support that mentality. but on behalf of singaporeans the nation round, i'm sorry. just remember that if you can prove he took pictures, you can call the police on him. the pdpa (personal data protection act) applies to every singaporean. no one is allowed to take your photo without your consent or ask for your ic card anymore (unless needed for verification purposes, usually by hospitals or government institutions).",Negative
"i am sorry to hear that happened with you in singapore. singapore is a benchmark when it comes to women‚Äôs safety (probably better than your mine country even), with women able to travel alone even post midnight on their own. it is not a norm but an exception. god forbid it happens again, the best idea would be to record him recording you, and submit evidence to police, instead of directly confronting him. hope you get over this incident soon! one other thing. people not interfering in someone else‚Äôs affairs (including incidents like these) is a cultural thing. as many people said already, most of the people here avoid such situations, doesn‚Äôt mean they are coward or so. hence i would request you to please do not call any nationality/ society coward, trying to give them learning about how they were brought up, because of one incident. taken care and stay safe!!",Positive
"i would help, and i have helped before (slightly different situation). i certainly hope someone would help if any one in my family encounters this. granted most people will be apathetic, because we're a busy and tired bunch, but a few of us could shed some light. it doesn't have to escalate or turn physical. sometimes speaking up  for what is right is good enough. i'm really sorry.",Positive
the bystander effect is pretty much as strong as it can get in singapore. nobody will ever intervene.,Positive
"sorry to hear about your experience. and good job for standing up for yourself! yeah it‚Äôs sad that no one on the bus seemed to care...honestly it‚Äôs a cultural thing, and i don‚Äôt know if will ever be changed. but at least for the redditors here, we should rmb your experience and try not to be a bystander next time.",Negative
"maybe they all thought it's none of their business, better don't get involve or maybe all of them thought you are over reacting. maybe they think that old man has the right to play with his camera and it's not unusual that anyone can appear on the screen. if what you claimed is true, those people won't even know if it's true about what you said especially if they hear that the old man is making sense. on top of that, heroes who stand up for others are rare nowadays not just in singapore but everywhere.",Positive
"sorry you had to experience that. but correct me if i'm wrong, i think its not illegal to take pictures of people. although it sucks, but he is not really committing a crime. if similar case happens, i think it's better to get off the bus and wait for the next one.",Negative
"we don‚Äôt really like to cause unnecessary problems to ourselves and ‚Äústepping up‚Äù to others when faced with this situation. besides, it happened in the morning, rush hour, still in a daze, rushing to work. so many underlying factors, police report, being a witness, explaining to our bosses what happened if we were late etc etc. i‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. but sometimes there are some individuals who will ‚Äústep up‚Äù especially those ahbengs, matreps, and those who dared. you happened to be at the wrong moment, the wrong time, the wrong environment and the wrong group of singaporeans.",Negative
sadly i have been in a similar situation as you and theres nothing we can do about it. its all part of being women,Negative
"not all singaporeans are like this. perhaps, if he assulted you, you would see an instant change in reaction and help. because in any case, no one could prove that it was an accident or on purpose and hence singaporeans being singaporeans just mind their own business lor. but if i witness it with my own eyes, i would step in provided hes not dangerous ah üòÇ",Positive
"thanks. i believe that no one would ever want to get involved in unnecessary troubles but this is not trouble, any kind of harassment is a crime. they turned a blind eye to what was happening. it‚Äôs very sad.",Negative
thank you for understanding. i hope so too.,Neutral
"agree, i‚Äôm starting to notice that too. thanks a lot for your kind words.",Positive
thank you. everyone there was careless so i was afraid that police wouldn‚Äôt believe me...,Negative
"this is the comment i‚Äôve been looking for, i can totally feel you girl. i‚Äôm terribly sorry for you and many girls out there being harassed this way or any other ways. it‚Äôs even worse that you were just a schoolgirl, it could have traumatized you a lot about your surroundings.someone commented on this thread that people taking our photos are not committing any crimes. it‚Äôs damn wrong. you know what? i read some articles where they exposed those nasty groups passing around our photos. we were unconsensual and became victims of those disgusting creatures.http://www.asiaone.com/digital/sharingiscaring-telegram-group-circulating-pictures-and-videos-schoolgirls-mrthope you are doing well and what happened in the past has stopped bothering you. i‚Äôm truly grateful and appreciated that you are open to share about this. take care girl ~ ‚ù§Ô∏è",Negative

"oh no, poor you girl. i wish i could be there to help you out..",Negative
"really appreciated that. i never thought of asking for driver‚Äôs help! i was so desperate, couldn‚Äôt think straight... i just wanted to get off the bus as fast as i could. thanks for telling me this, it would definitely help me later on.",Positive
how will the driver help her when on an expressway,Neutral
"honestly, this is really sad. reading your comment just broke my heart. i hope that your friend is doing well now and same for you. i‚Äôm glad that you did the right thing unconditionally, which helped to save your friend‚Äôs life. many people needs excuses to act kindly and we are not them ok? i believe in karma, if you do the right things, peace will find your soul.thanks for being yourself and treating people with a kind heart.",Positive
thank you! i‚Äôve always expected singapore to be the safest country. this is the first time i‚Äôve encountered this in sin but how people reacted was what shocked me the most.,Positive

"i‚Äôm so sorry for what happened to you. like some people advised me to report to bus drivers and they would call police. at least that perv will have a stain on his criminal record, which is a disadvantage for him in the future. i understand how panic and frustrated we could be in those situations and no one around was willing to help or protect us. i hope this could be helpful for us, women, to deal with this in the future. after i posted this, there were many maniacs disturbed me, victim-blamed me for pointing out this ugly side. still, i never regret for speaking up so women like you could read and understand that you are not alone!",Negative

"ikr! thanks for understanding. he did yelled at me and tried to explain way too much. psychologically, people wouldn‚Äôt behave in such ways if they are truly innocent. he did try to blame me and told everyone i was crazy... i didn‚Äôt dare to film him back tho, i was afraid he could do something more.",Positive
your cousin is a brave girl! i can‚Äôt believe how that female colleague could even do such a thing in the office environment. i‚Äôm glad her superior and hr did take action well to protect her.,Positive

"well, from what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs a cultural thing that people wouldn‚Äôt step up when things ain‚Äôt right. i guess it‚Äôs brave to do so, rather than helping the victim. it‚Äôs called ‚Äúselfish‚Äù.",Positive
"i‚Äôm glad and thankful to hear that. you‚Äôre a hero, i wish everyone could think and act like you. it would break my heart if someone i love have to suffer this kind of thing by themselves. it‚Äôs so lonely and insecured :( nowadays, it doesn‚Äôt need only courage but also excuses to be kind.",Positive
"i guess you were right. i tried to stay calm and asked him not to take any photos of mine. before i stopped him, the front camera was aiming at me for no less than 5s, i could see my whole side portrait on it. he yelled at me a lot after i exposed him, which might confused people that he did nothing wrong to me and i‚Äôm the insane one. it was just sad that people <50cm close to me there couldn‚Äôt stop looking at their phone for a few secs to see what was going on to this lady, trying to protect herself.",Negative

this comment saddens me so much... i wish more people would stand up to this kind of bs,Positive
"i guess you are one of them, those people who saw terrible things happened right on their face and decided to ignore. ‚Äúwe are only hearing your side of the story‚Äù - this is the reason why so many women never speak up about harassment, they think that no one would believe them if there are no proofs.i‚Äôm only here because the company needs me, fyi, i‚Äôm not going to leave just because of this bs. there still so many nice and kind people are here to hold me back, it‚Äôs pity that they were not on that bus to proctect me.",Positive
asking her to leave isnt exactly a good response to her posting about being harassed..,Positive

welcome to singapore. all we do here is take photos and complain online.,Positive
"its been a long time since you posted this but i wanna just say that i hope you don't have a bad impression of singapore because of this. the younger generation is getting more and more vocal about such issues, and in time to come, i think itll be closer and closer to the state of your country. i think its not only just singapore but more of asia in general. we have a culture and have been taught since young to not meddle in other peoples' business.",Positive
"don‚Äôt worry, they will. most buses have cctvs so it‚Äôs not like they can‚Äôt trace it. but quick thought or the footage might be recycled",Positive
it isn‚Äôt a crime but highly likely they will have indecent files in their phone as well. victims should persist that the authorities do a forensic check on the culprits phone in the future. i think we should write in to the mps regarding this. should the photo really be taken without consent and on purpose. i think it is inappropriate that no action is taken.,Positive
"thanks for the well wishes. surprisingly i rarely ever think of this incident. but it has made me a little more paranoid(?) in a sense. if i see someone holding up their phone, or angling their phone in a weird way, my brain automatically rings ""here we go again"", and i'd stare really hard at the person. if they notice right away, to can bet your ass they were filming you, if not its most likely harmless. but apart from forcing me to be hyper aware in situations like those (hence never being able to rest on the trains or bus), i managed to get away rather unharmed. maybe largely due to the kind stranger who helped calm me down and made me feel safe? you stay safe too, there's a whole lot more of sick psychos than we'd like to admit even in a safe haven like singapore...",Positive
honestly even better for it to go viral,Positive
"tried staring back but his eyes were really freaky haha, thanks for the advice tho! sometimes it works xd",Positive
wow... people actually played that card? i would like to see them face a similar situation overseas and see if they would like being told to get out of the country,Positive
"thank you for sharing, and i‚Äôm sorry you got all those shitty messages. being violated in public makes you feel really dirty, although you haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. i remember being really shaken for a few days after that, and my then-boyfriend treating it like a joke or some funny anecdote i should bring up at parties. you‚Äôre right, though, sharing experience can help both you and other people deal with similar situations.",Negative
"i hope you'll never ever experience the same again. im not a hero, it just disgusts and irritates me. protecting the ladies was not my first thought tbh , im more of angry that such things can occur. idk how to explain the feeling. like wtf, be a man not an impish bastard. if you need sexual gratification, either pay for it , diy or brush up some skills. dont be a slimeball. ok, i think im an antihero.",Negative
"last i check, everyone is staying at home or working from home due to covid-19. sorry we're not there to save you. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",Negative
you are even more brave to speak up in public!,Positive
"it is called ‚Äúminding their own business‚Äù. i am amused how u call the whole society coward or selfish based on a single incident involving a group of people who might not even represent 1% of the population. and your tone seems demeaning (not the op but response to my comment). again, i condemn the incident that happened with you, but calling the whole society selfish/ coward, isn‚Äôt justified.",Positive
i feel you and i certainly understand it sucks to feel people weren't helpful but this is the sad truth that majority of the people are afraid to get into trouble or troubled. i was once molested in public and no one came to my help. i totally understand how you feel.,Negative
"maybe redditors here are more outspoken and gungho, but my experience growing up is that people like to play it safe.no rocking the boat. especially in companies. they will complain during lunch and social media, but they will never do anything about it.they can't even stand up for themselves, let alone a stranger in public transport.",Positive
nice!,Positive
going viral to shit on him 100 times back,Negative
"i really didn‚Äôt know that! it‚Äôs ridiculous! however, i‚Äôm glad that you are totally aware of what is going on. thank you for being thoughtful.",Positive
"i know i‚Äôm not at the right place to say this but i believe no human beings should take this as a joke, specially when it‚Äôs someone close to them who had to suffer this. imo, the fact that your bf‚Äôs taking it as a joke is nasty, he doesn‚Äôt care about your feeling at all. when i told my bf, he was so upset and sad that he couldn‚Äôt be there to protect me, he even planned to get me out of here right after. the person who loves you should always prioritize your feelings, your health and your mentality. it‚Äôs your life but my only advise to you is don‚Äôt ever let anyone make you feel less about yourself, you always deserve the best. xo",Negative
"hmm, i don‚Äôt really get how you interpreted what i wrote but i never assume the whole society is coward. i‚Äôm amazed by how you are trying to mock me now and turning me into a bad person for being harassed.what i meant, also what i wrote, was i have never expect that such an ignorance & cowardness to happen in here, this safest country, singapore.it‚Äôs not a crime, yet, it‚Äôs called stalking and it‚Äôs illegal.i agree with what you said, i did solo travel here twice and that could tell you much that i love this country, its people and culinary. such a thing happened that disappointed me about how people would react when i needed help.",Negative

this bus was used in the 80s till around 1994 or 1995. the one you rode were probably the non aircon scania n113 single deck buses which replaced this bus after they were all taken out of service.this was the one you probably rode growing up.. https://www.flickr.com/gp/imranbecks/q0f8ji,Negative

"**[volvo_b57](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volvo_b57)**   >volvo b57 was a front-engined single-decker bus chassis manufactured by volvo between 1966 and 1982. since 1970 it was also available as the volvo bb57, with the engine mounted on top of the front axle, giving the buses very little front overhang. the bb57 became a kind of replacement for the smaller b54, but as it was larger, the b54 got its true replacement later. the predecessor to bb57, the b615 had gone out of production in 1965, but apparently the demand for such a model was so high that they had to bring it back almost half a decade later, as the b54 proved to be too small. ^([ )[^(f.a.q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wikisummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(opt out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=wikisummarizerbot&message=optout&subject=optout)^( | )[^(opt out of subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/singapore/about/banned)^( | )[^(github)](https://github.com/sujal-7/wikisummarizerbot)^( ] downvote to remove | v1.5)",Positive

(if her kids were that insistent)you aren‚Äôt in the wrong, but i felt that if you are brave enough (i certainly am not), you could have asked her if she still wanted the seats at the window, as you didn‚Äôt notice that she wanted the 4 window seats for her family, and was too caught up in your video to notice. you could have just threw in an empty apology just to lighten to mood if she was mad.this is a way of changing the culture of passive-aggressiveness that we have today in singapore i guess. reading your post made me reflect on what i could do better to improve my reaction towards bad encounters, and make both me and the other party‚Äôs lives better, if only so slightly. it takes guts, lots of guts, but i believe if enough people act like that, singaporean society will indeed improve. :)edit: i‚Äôm really sorry if this reply stirred up resentment or anger in anyone. it was truly not my intention to incite such feelings in anyone, and i genuinely apologise if you do feel this way. this reply was meant to theorise how both sides could have better managed the situation, and come out of it more positively; and by extension, how singaporean society can change for the better. anyway, i hope you have a good day, and that this reply has not ruined it.",Positive

you know grab screwed up when taxi fares are lower than fares on grab,Neutral
"love it. more competition is sorely needed in the transportation sector, and grab should‚Äôve never been allowed to buy uber sg in the first place.",Positive
honestly sometimes comfort is cheaper than other taxi services. and they would pick me up/drop me off at far flung places,Positive
"i'm no fan of grab at all. but i remember before uber and grab came along, cdg was the og monopolistic bully in the market. they'd raise taxi rental on drivers and increase fare at will. it was also super hard to get taxis. if i needed a taxi on weekends or weekday peak hours, i could wait up to 1 hour by the road cos sengkang was supposedly very far. most of us have forgotten the experience of standing by the road waving at taxis and them not stopping, and later when we finally caved in and call, we see the same taxis coming to pick us up. taxis used to be such luxury and would easily cost double or more the fares today. i  only had budget for 2 taxi rides a month as a young adultuber (not grab) changed everything!",Positive
"i actually very much want to use comfort over grab. however for me somehow when comparing prices between comfort and grab (from central to the north), it‚Äôs usually the same price (which i‚Äôll book comfort) or grab is slightly cheaper (though now with the extra 1 dollar comfort may edge slightly ahead) -  not sure if this is unique to long d trips?",Positive
good. more competition always benefit consumers,Positive
"ah the weekly grab circlejerk. people still forget that grab tends to be cheaper during peak hours and is more consistent.i use all taxi brands and whichever is the cheapest, i go for it. definitely am liking this move from cdg.",Positive
comfort is mostly cheaper these days and the fact that their drivers are laojiao taxi drivers with no need for gps (which can be wrong at times).,Negative
they should fix their app first. the discount code always has glitches. even though the discount has been applied somehow you end up paying the full fare.,Positive
always used comfort after uber left.,Neutral
finally. for years cdg has been growing fat and slow from its near monopoly in taxi booking. only until uber and grab started with their vastly superior apps that they start to wake up the idea and start investing in developing their platform.,Negative

"fuck grab, that is all",Negative
this is my experience. grab drivers need gps and cannot go off map as they don't care to know the shortcut. cdg drivers thru zip don't use gps. they tell me the shortcuts they will take.the metered fares should be phased out as they encourage tricks of the trade. zip and low fares is the way to claw back business. maybe grab will be aggressive with their promotions after p2ha!,Neutral

"big big hooray from me! stop grab's money grabbing! support companies with diversified shareholding and stop padding the pockets of anthony tan! so many unethical practices and always go back on their promises (still angry they cancelled my delivery pass just when covid struck). rather tip the delivery guy more and pay grab less, that's the true meaning of support local, not support one man's pocket.",Positive

during late night grab is usually cheaper.,Negative
nothing to love imo. they already had an app. now they are adding unrelated services into it like car rental which is irrelevant to 99 percent of current app users.,Positive
you are so right! i've been a loyal cdg user rhese days but i did forget of the monopoly days where we were at the mercy of cabbies.getting a cab after a night out was a nightmare on certain time of the day. i lived in the city. all the cabs wanted to go to bedok and wouldnt pick me up. i walked home on some days.,Positive
"i hated that constant increase of fare, and stupid reasons of we haven't increased fares in so and so years. then when they introduce a new taxi model bam! higher fares.but the absolute worst thing is the confusing as fuck surcharges, and area surcharges and surcharge for pickup at airport and rws/mbs.and if that's not all.....cdg owns sbs transit, who fucks you by constantly increasing bus fares year on year.so when people see cdg as some sort of 'saviour' from the likes of grab, all i see is a giant knocked of it's perch and now playing the victim.fyi: grab actually started of as grabtaxi which actually tried to solve the issue of an app for taxi booking.",Negative
"honestly there are some factors determining the price, such as distance, traffic and demand, to name but a few. ultimately if they are around the same price, i'd rather flag down a taxi for a cheaper price (no booking fee) and just go by the meter, especially when i know that there is little to no traffic. just curious if you book comfort, do you use flat rate or go by meter?",Negative
flat rate as shown on the app which is the one that is similar to grab. meter price always seems higher on the app (!!),Positive
"i've heard that grab is able to peek at the other apps running in your phone, and can detect when you're price shopping and adjust their offered price so that they don't lose out. whereas if you're not actively comparing, they know it's safe to gouge you.",Positive
"this is an important point, my personal experience is comfortdelgro cabbies have generally higher and more consistent professional quality - know the places, know the ways, smooth driving. some part-time grab drivers can really drive you crazy. one time the gps was not accurate in showing the entrance of the complex, and my dear driver religiously followed the gps and took me around the block two rounds....",Positive
if at first you don‚Äôt succeed‚Ä¶,Positive
"pretty sure grab's only enemy is itself, it dominate the market as long as it doesn't self destruct. comfort ,like all giant glc in sg , is unlikely to change or innovate fast enough and will die a slow death..",Positive

clear breach of safety protocols. i used to be a mechanic. first rule we learned in mechanic school is to support the vehicle using stands instead of relying on jacks.,Positive
now then report?where's the transparency?,Neutral
"it is good to see several former mechanics cringing at this in the comments at lack of jack stand use.  i was once a mechanic. now i am in engineering management. the problem to me can be traced deeper.  lets start with the why. it is enormously unsafe to work underneath a vehicle supported by jacks. it is almost always hugely unsafe to put humans underneath any heavy load supported solely by a lifting mechanism. lifting mechanisms can back out and drop the load on you. manual floor jacks are designed to be mobile and easy to finely position under a vehicle. the compromise is that this mobility prevents them from being optimally stable. most designs can topple or slip if side forces are applied to the jack or the vehicle. to attain lightness means they typically don't have a fail safe mechanism ( like a brake or ratchet) to prevent you from being crushed if the mechanism backs out.   the other thing about this incident is that there were multiple people who we injured or killed by the bus falling on them. this strongly suggests to me that this obviously unsafe practice is tolerated by the people on the ground and at minimum, the layer of management above them. the layers of management above that are at minimum incentivising this kind of shortcut or even forcing it to happen due to not buying enough proper equipment.-- ie: giam siap exploitative nonsense.   this article was posted by a user below. it appears that the workers were jury rigging by using two emergency scissor jacks to lift a bus.  this is insane. a scissor jack typically has a weight rating of 1.5 tons. a single deck bus, when empty, will weight about 18 tons. even the byd c6 electric minibuses are about 7 tons. even in the best case scenario where you have a minibus, lifting a corner of a bus is likely to overload one of the two jacks due to unequal sharing of the weight. and we know that in the real world the jacks were overloaded because one of them bucked under the weight. this practice is unacceptably dangerous even if they were just using this clownshow set-up to lift the bus on to a set of properly rated jack stands. an over-loaded jack can fail and shoot metal into your body.  the question i want to ask is this: why dafuq are workers in a depot using a set of emergency automotive scissor jacks to do this? are there insufficient lifts and mechanics pits for the amount of productivity upper management is demanding from these workers? cranking a whole ass bus on 2 of these stupid under-powered manual scissor jacks is not going to be easy. this is both more work and less safe. which worker is going to want to do this kind of tiring dangerous nonsense unless people above were squeezing them to do it? you tell me.   they probably knew it was unsafe, but had to comply. i wonder if they were foreign workers who essentially have no choice if management demands irresponsible crazy shit like this of them  everytime we have accidents like this, our establishment like to shoot all blame at the lowest ranking, ideally dead, scapegoat. there will be some kafka-esque motherhood statements about ""always safely follow safety regulations"" and "" safety breaches are caused by not following safety rules"" and  that will be that. there is always great resistance to systemic and process driven change because achieving this requires that people think critically about systems and infrastructure rather than endlessly thinking critically about other people. in an authoritarian country the former is impossible while the latter is obligatory.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/workplace-deaths-smrt-workers-pinned-under-bus-wheel-loader-14978742",Positive

"there is very good reason for this. the reason we can trust elevators and escalators is that these machines have a safety brake. elevator hoist mechanism failures are very rare, but we still have a few of them every year in singapore. but this is mitigated by multiple layers of redundant mechanism that a jack or a winch is not going to have.  of course, these poor buggers were never going to end up protected by a jack stand. they were not even provided with a proper floor jack that could withstand the load. they were using consumer grade scissor jacks that lacked capacity to safely lift that bus and are designed for emergency or occasional use.--not for a workshop. if they are that deprived of equipment, i don't think they would be using a jack stand, no matter how much they should have.",Negative
"can you point to me in our media and in regulator statements where there is any accountability for management, let alone any 'knee jerk opinion is to blame the management' at any point of authority in our system?you get this sort of system testing behavior because sinkie management is famous for sending mixed signals because it wants to have its cake and eat it. it issues paper rules that show it wants work to be done safely, but does not buy proper modern equipment. it does not want to pay to hire skilled professionals. and yet it wants high throughput. people test the system because management says you can't do that, but essentially rewards you ( or withholds punishment for 'poor performance at meeting kpi') if you do it but don't get caught. this is not the way to properly manage or engineer a process.what do people get out of 'testing the system'? you can argue convenience, but it is the job of management to supervise, hire qualified workers, provide modern equipment and implement proper process design that the safe way is the most convenient way using both push and pull factors. and even then it is not relevant, in this case, this worker was killed using a manual, unstable, inadequate jack to support a bus. he was killed doing something in both the maximally unsafe and maximally inconvenient way. he was doing this as part of a team where all of them could see them doing this. so what is there left to talk? why would someone do something like that in a depot where proper lifting equipment is inevitably not far away? please consider what is the most likely situation.either we have a failure of management, or this worker is a siaolang, his colleagues are all siaolang and everyone around there are all siaolang. at this rate, everyone who works a peasant job is simply an undetected siaolang. to be discovered when something bad happens to them and they are found to not 'safely follow safety regulations"" or some cock shit like that.",Negative

"i know you are pointing your statement at me. otherwise why would you bother writing it. it does not matter where you point your statement if you simply refuse any invitation to critical thinking and don't know anything about what you are talking about.   the reason managers make more money is because they must bear an overarching responsibility for everything that happens. if something happens, it is ipso facto management's responsibility. only in our authoritarian bootlicking society is it the case where we afford management all the ball sack carrying, with none of the responsibility. when things go right, we tabik those above us like the government, management. when things go wrong, it is because of those 'siaolang stupid peasants testing system'.  this is why our safety and process management culture sucks.  we are aware of what people's incentives are. we are aware of the circumstances of this case. we are aware of human nature. it is highly anomalous for workers to choose the most difficult and unsafe way to do things if an easier and safer way is available. we must question why management, the people ultimately responsible, have their workers behaving in this anomalous way.  i don't know if you are living under a rock or are just incapable of the critical thinking needed to understand how to have a good safety culture. i have explained this very clearly. the nature of singaporean 'safety investigations'  is highly superficial. highly superficial investigations tend to result in only the first layer of causation being highlighted.  this first layer of causation tends to highlight immediate causes ( the worker using the wrong jack and not using a jackstand) and this focus on immediate causes tends to allow bad management practices to disappear in to the background and allows motivated people to twist the facts to blame frontline workers.    to be fair to the people doing these investigations, mom and the coroner's office are going to be looking for regulatory breaches and breaches of the law. it is not in their purview to assess management competence. it is not illegal to be a shitty manager. it is only sometimes illegal to provide workers with inadequate equipment or do any of the things that lead to accidents.  and yet i will typically find bootlicking sinkies taking investigation findings that are silent on deeper layers of causation to mean that the investigation has vindicated management and to chuck all the blame at that "" stupid sialang peasant moron"" who got himself squished by a bus/fall from a height/ howitzer gun barrel etc...",Negative

maybe park downstairs his hdb hahaha,Positive
quis custodiet ipsos custodes?,Neutral
every bus can be opened then operated by at least 2 drivers. the sbs scholars rostered the driver such that at 245am that shift last driver drives home and lo behold the next shift driver who lives nearby is there to take over and drive d bus back to depot and reporting for duty.i dont know what happens if there are no 2 bus drivers who live near each other (perhaps non local drivers take it back from their dormitory or place of stay).oh i forgot this /s,Positive
on a completely unrelated note cheers to your dad for doing the hero's work,Positive
i really really like this initiative. my main worry though is how they keep it clean and hygienic.,Positive
nothing like a fresh gooey pile of phlegm on the water cooler drainage to keep me away. how they execute this is really important,Positive
they could change the design so that fresh water comes out of the dispenser without the base (to prevent people from spitting) similar to what i saw in austria where water came out from a tap when you pressed a lever with your foot using a foot pedal. there was no way spit could go back into the water dispenser. design something hygienic and useful. not the water cooler thing we had since the 1980s.,Negative

yup same worries. no way i am going to drink water from a hawker center water cooler in the current stage. sure got people use it to wash their hands.,Positive

rode this once before last year. only seen this at town tho,Neutral
"if you're calling this ""new"", i guess you don't really ride buses that often. this three door bus was introduced on bus 7 quite a few years back iirc. the original intention was to construct a proof-of-concept to improve movement of commuters by having three doors.however, about a year ago, this bus design was rejected in favour of another design which placed the staircase facing the opposite direction. rationale for this was to prevent commuters from flying forward when they are standing on the stairs and the bus brakes. thus you can see in this bus 7 that they have a mini retractable door on the upper deck that only opens when the downstairs door is open.",Neutral
"looking at your username, my first thought was my two kids running up and down the staircases. the design ensures the down going staircase only goes to the exit door - neat design there.",Positive
"i hope the bus operators would put the 3-door dds on those high demand bus routes that causes a lot of congestion at some problematic bus stops, not just on long distance trunk routes with consistent loading.one of the benefit of articulated bendy bus and 3-door dds (by extension) is the faster rate of passengers alighting. the faster people get off the bus, the less time spent dwelling at the congested bus stop, the lesser the congestion would be.while it may be very convenient for trunk routes with consistent loading to have simultaneous boarding and alighting, i hope the bus operators can see that other routes, such as certain feeder routes, might benefit from it too.",Negative

whichever route involves less walking and fewer unsheltered paths to my destination.,Negative
"prefer mrt, and take buses only when mrt is unavailable because buses are slow and some of them take very crazy circuitous routes.",Negative
"bus, more seats, more comfortable, less squeezy. although mrt is usually faster, i feel very stress out when there are lots of people and people eating into my space sitting beside me left and right. and also, some people seems to overlook that 1 seat on mrt is just for 1 person, not two adults to share. so yeah, bus for more peace and less stress.",Positive
"mrt because you never know when you‚Äôre going to end up waiting 12-20 minutes for the next bus. ugh. and on a bus i need to pay attention to which stop i am at, which i find very stressful.",Positive
by foot,Neutral
"need to see crowded and distance, if its short distance bus idm but if its fucking long it needs to have seats. our bus drives zam brake a lot my knees hurt.",Negative
bus,Neutral
"bus because more likely to be able to sit down and also dont need to walk to the freaking platform level, which is godamn far for some stations (i am looking at you bencoolen station)",Positive

mrt will not be popular in singapore unless there will be traffic jams.,Negative
"bus for short trips, mrt for long journeys.",Negative
bus :) am able to appreciate the views outside and get some down time as well,Positive
"mrt to school. bus back home. the 45min bus ride always hits different, especially if i had to stay back and it‚Äôs dark",Negative
"i prefer mrt, the bus shaking and turning everywhere is a bit weird for me. when it gets very crowded, mrt don't feel as bad as bus because the mrt don't shake around as much as bus, pushing you against people.",Negative
"buses ftw, especially when you‚Äôre on a double decker and you‚Äôre on the first row. fewer people in general, and you can see the scenery. love to listen to podcasts when i‚Äôm on a bus. that said, why on earth aren‚Äôt all buses equipped with a screen indicating next stop is beyond me",Positive
kinda servere motion sickness. so... mrt is the only option unless is a very short trip to somewhere with bus,Positive
bus :d more seats and air conditioner is vv strongeasier to sleep,Positive
mrt,Neutral

"i hate to travel by bus, its always crowded because travelling from east side to north side(woodlands area), mrt is never as convenient as bus for that route. used to go to woodlands temporary bus interchange in the past, the queue was super long and i hated it. it sucks. during morning rush hour, can never get onto the bus, squeeze here and there, must wait for at least 15 minutes for the next one, always feel like i am rushing every morning.",Negative
mrt because what if you need to use the bathroom during your ride!!,Neutral
bus ftw,Neutral
tbh whichever's more convenient and nearer to the destination,Positive
"bus‚Äìso much nicer, but smrt faster for shorter rides",Positive
i prefer travelling by bus. can sit down and enjoy the journey,Positive

"bus ftw‚Ä¶once i finish poly, all the way have been taking mrt from ns commute till now for my current work place commute i miss long bus journeys",Negative
"i prefer to take bus no matter how long it takes for me to get from point a to b. at least i have a chance to seat down and take a look at the scenery. i can control my air vent also. mrt can help you get to your destination fast. but it's hard to find a seat, or rather most of the time you have to offer your seat to others. and the seating arrangement will cause you to stare at people or some awkward location most of the time.",Positive
if need to stand i prefer mrt. if can sit i prefer bus.,Neutral
train - i can‚Äôt stand having to sit through road traffic.,Neutral
"if there's there's direct bus to said location, the duration doesn't matter to me much 'cause i just sleep in the bus. xd",Positive
i used to take a bus for almost 2h just visit my aunt who lives around thomson. those places were in accessible,Neutral
only thing i hate is when the bus window have ppl‚Äôs sweat stains tho esp when i‚Äôm just about to lean on the spot *gags*,Negative
"yeh, but i overslept and ride to some new area which i've never been before xd",Positive
"for bukit panjang to orchard/bugis, bus and mrt takes around the same time. not too hard to find a seat for either one too.personally i prefer taking bus for the highway sector and then transfer at stevens for the last mile transport.",Negative
972 then stephen ftw,Neutral
same. i always envy people who can use their phones on buses throughout their trip without feeling motion sick. mrt isn't that bad for me though.,Negative
same. motion sickness is a thing on buses,Neutral
i got motion sickness on mrt when they peak the speed lmao,Neutral
you never took the bus on a school route early in the morning?,Positive
long bus journey + raining üëåüëå,Negative

i overslept when the bus arrived at the interchange and i was trapped in a parked bus xd,Negative
exact same route! hahahah 190 972 960 ftw,Positive
"agree, mrt's movement is more predictable and less jerky. buses are at the mercy of traffic and lights, which causes more starts and stops. ten minutes bus rides are fine but the longer it is, the more likely i'll feel sick.",Positive
"yeah but as op listed, bus has better scenery as a distraction",Positive
yes. see the droplets/streaks on the window :')  just wanna sit in the bus and not leave lol,Positive
"asmr alert! haha, tbh i love it too.",Positive
"not all busses have been installed or upgraded with these new system. have to wait those older version de to be scrapped off first.but yeah, the lcd screen really helps me a lot when im going somewhere new.",Positive
how have you never seen that grease patch? although i always figured that anyone who finds that gross prolly also doesn't entertain the idea of resting their head there,Neutral

how did you get out?! don't the bus captain obligingly have to conduct check after their shift??!,Neutral

"i was sleeping on the second floor, all the way at the back, i guess he just didn't see me. when i woke, i was startled and went down to the first floor and waited there for him to come for his next shift...",Positive
that‚Äôs both sad and hilarious,Negative
"i wish people don‚Äôt smoke and walk, even without covid going on. it‚Äôs horrible to be walking behind or near them and always have to rush to overtake them.",Negative
i hate this too. its disgusting that we have to inhale their sick smoke.,Negative
fuck smokers. commit them to smoking booths. i hate smelling their foul air whenever i pass by them in public areas. litterbuggers too,Negative
"singapore needs those smoking booth like they do in japan, helps provide fresher air for citizens and also gives a space to smokers. as a smoker, very obviously the minority in the comment section, with this covid situation, i dont know when i am ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to put my mask down and where i can stand for a smoke break. after a long tiring day at work, the moment i pull down my mask for a break, i get stares. its not comfortable for any of us, and especially when kids walk past, i will put my cigg behind me and swish the air to clear the smell. hence, for the better of all people, highly recommend a smoking booth.",Negative
"i think it‚Äôs fine to smoke if you‚Äôre not walking about. same as if you‚Äôre drinking, like if you‚Äôre just in one spot and quickly finish your drink or cig and go. don‚Äôt walk around. but yesterday i was doing that (drinking in a corner) and sda told me that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not allowed to drink in public now‚Äù =_= what the heck kinda logic lol..",Positive
as a ex-smoker of 20 years. i am glad i chose to quit citing health reasons. but one of the other reasons i quit was because it was becoming such an inconvenience to smoke in sg. also the inconvenience and damage to others having to put up with the second hand smoke.,Positive
"just common courtesy... eating, drinking, exercising with a mask off: don't do it around people.",Negative
always disturbed me. i have posted a similar thread a couple of weeks back. i now make sure i put at least 5 meters between them and i.,Positive
"another hate scene, often i see parents smoking while walking (maskless) on the streets and their children is right beside them.. like seriously, they want their kids to die faster than them??",Negative
"i don't live in singapore, but considering how clean it is there i am baffled smoking is allowed in public areas.",Positive
"the worst is when they smoke at the fitness corner. if you ask them kindly to smoke somewhere else because you are doing your workout there, they immediately become defensive and will ask you if you own the park‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt like it, go away‚Ä¶ unbelievable! can never win with these ppl",Negative
pandemic or not. smokers shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to smoke in public imo,Neutral
"covid wise, as long as they are a few meters away from anyone, it should be fine. it would be worse to have designated smoking points, be filled with maskless smokers, with a chance to cause a cluster. if, singapore wants to be cleaner, legalize and tax e-ciggs. i'd rather sniff a cloud of watermelon than whatever black tar they put in ciggs.",Positive
"only reason why smoking has not been banned yet is becuz of the tax and profits for the economy, hate the smell so much .",Negative
is it sooo fucking hard for them to not smoke and walk???,Negative
"i walk around with my mask down if i am drinking or eating something. no one has ever said anything to me or stopped me.what i don't do is walk up to people and hang around while i am eating on the go, neither, i think, are smokers walking up to people and hanging around them when they are smoking.",Negative
"yeah exactly! i asked about this last week. apparently really no rule or law to get people to adhere to. could we take photos with our phones and send it up to oneservice? speaking of which, there‚Äôs this unker who loves to loiter around the void decks and carpark downstairs, and recently i‚Äôve found not less than thirty cigarette butts pressed into the grass at where he usually squats. does the oneservice app deal with such matters?",Positive
i support the ban,Neutral
"as a smoker who likes to walk while smoking, good luck stopping this. because i'm not going to stop doing it :) but before you demonise me, i don't throw my butts on the ground, nor do i intentionally blow smoke in peoples' faces (unless i really dislike them or don't care at all), but people do stare at me when i pull my mask down for a cigg. at this stage, i welcome it.",Positive
smokers and runners. never understood the logic.,Neutral
"smokers should smoke in the designated smoke zone. those zones are made and exist for a reason. if the smoker is not following the rules, we'll  they ought to be fined. simple as that. and when they are done smoking  the mask needs to be back on. again, simple as that.",Neutral
no. def not. who knows if covid travels on smoke streams. high chance they are spreading it,Positive
lock them up in changi.,Neutral
do you put on your mask while eating at the hawker centre while chatting with your friends and colleagues? just because it is smoking it is offensive? grow up lah effing karen,Neutral
cb what‚Äôs so good about smoking anyway.,Positive
"yeah i agree.. just like in jap or korea, have to go specific area for smoking. we implement this in some of the areas in sg, like orchard, people start to kpkb.",Negative
the best is while trying to lose weight and running and panting and basically dying in a park‚Ä¶ then you take a reeaaaaall deeeeep breath‚Ä¶ of second hand smoke from some rando‚Ä¶absorbing all that cancer straight to my lungs‚Ä¶,Positive
yes yes yes! always need to pray that the wind is in the right direction,Positive
"i'm a former heavy smoker and i approve of this. it would be beneficial for both smokers (can smoke in peace) and non-smokers (can breathe in peace) to have a dedicated smoking space especially in this pandemic. and bru as a former smoker, the whiff of cig smoke even after several years still sends craving chills down my spine.",Negative
"recently, 2 smoking booths were installed below the blocks at clementi. this is a pilot program and hopefully they roll this out to the rest of singapore.",Neutral
"u should have asked them how they consume their liquids. if they give a reasonable answer, just follow suit.",Neutral
but there is no law that says smoking while walking is not allowed. same goes for drinking,Neutral
"eh? i know cannot eat in restaurants, but now also cannot drink/eat alone in one corner (or a bench in a park)?",Neutral
i've wondered about this. were you inside or outside? it kinds makes sense if it's in a mall or something.,Neutral
i do drink when walking but make sure i am far from people.  anyone nearby i stop and pull mask back up. if alot of people sometimes i wait until i reach home to open it,Positive
true this. i used to smoke alot in australia but stepping out for a smoke in sg (commonly in spots not under shelter) makes me all sweaty and hot and not relaxed lol.,Positive
"if parents are smoking next to their kids, yes, there is a high chance their kids will not live as long as they will. it's basic science. second hand smoking kills faster.",Positive
"the problem has exacerbated since the pandemic. during the day, our homes get filled with smoke. the law says smoking can be done just 5m away from exercise areas. and many smoke right beside them. people feel helpless.  the goverment announced that it does not know how to solve this problem and said it has no plans to : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfxr3c6shjy",Positive
"yes! i even asked nea about this. they were like ""smokers can smoke as long as its 5m away from the exercise corner"".  and i'm like, hpw unwise is that law?? 5m is just not sufficient. btw, smoking inside the exercise corner is not legal. never let them smoke. i would go the extent of taking a video and reporting the violation if they do so. but i will give them a chance to move away first.",Negative
"worse, smoking at children's playground or near entrance or windows to preschool. like killing yourselves not enough, you want to kill other people's children?",Negative
lol!,Positive
this is a great idea. can you explain this process? to whom should we send the photos to?,Positive
thank you.,Neutral
"just wondering. as you say, you're not intentionally blowing smoke in peoples face. when you walk and smoke, you're actually blowing to those who are walking behind you directly. are you aware of that?these ppl could be kids, hv lung problem etc, but would be trapped to breath 2nd hand smoke unless they try to overtake you, or inconvenience themselves by taking a different route, or intentionally wait for you to walk to a sufficient distance.do you think it's fair for them for your enjoyment?or do you ensure that no one is walking behind you before you walk and smoke?",Negative

are you that unintelligent?,Neutral
runners don't send life shortening cancer causing smoke in your way when they walk next to you. smokers do.people died in singapore due to second hand smoking. other peoples running did not cause people cancers or deaths. feel sorry i had to dum this down to this level for your to teach you the difference betwen smokers and runners.,Negative
"the difference is runners is doing strenuous exercise, but only allowed to remove mask while doing exercise and placed back immediately after",Neutral
logic is simple  .. smokers spread toxic chemicals. runners don‚Äôt. never heard (or had) an encounter where a runner exhaled at someone's face to the point where they kena covid or toxic fumes. anyways it's easy to just stand away from runners ... for smokers their smoke spreads further even when you're standing away from them.,Positive
i agree. why can‚Äôt they just run on a treadmill i‚Äôll or at least in a less crowded place like in the park? why they must run across the neighbourhood and increase the risk of spreading,Negative
we should petition to ban smokers in all.,Neutral
"smlj comparison is this, second hand smoke is toxic and can result in lung cancer to the innocent victims.",Positive
i run round a 400m track at a nearby park. it's a bad time when a random uncle decides to sit at the bench and puff a smoke. it's 8-10 rounds of smoke pit stops i will be putting my body through.,Negative
"i know, but for the sake of not walking about with mask down i try not to walk and drink. it‚Äôs a personal choice, but just.. i hope more ppl can be considerate in that sense.",Positive
"i guessing it's okay as long as it's not over an extended distance and period of time, especially so now that there are more restrictions on unmasked activities like dining in",Positive
"yes, what about those too far from home. where do they eat or drink eh",Positive
what are you talking about? who tf smokes in a mall?,Neutral
i would have probably gone bankrupt funding my smoking in australia!,Neutral
"wait now. it‚Äôs true secondhand smoke kills faster, but smokers are exposed to second hand smoke too. so no matter what, they go first.",Positive
"hahaha i think the government just does not want to fix it, here in spain you can only smoke in public in designated places, same in japan, and it's honestly one of the things i miss about spain when going to other countries.",Positive
ban smoking.you‚Äôre welcome pap. don‚Äôt need to pay consultation fees.,Positive
those ppl that are shameless enough to do this and even argue back with you will have very thick skin. i rather don‚Äôt engage with them,Neutral
"it's more of the latter. unlike many others, i have fairly heightened situational awareness (though borne out of paranoia, but another story for another day).typically, i have a 2 - 3 metre rule of not smoking within other people, and not under shelters where footfall is the heaviest. of course, smoke travels, and thus i'm unable to fully contain the smoke, despite my best abilities. another exception would be non-smoker family and friends, so too bad for them if they wish to accompany me on smoke breaks (which i advise them not to, to an extent, but whatcha gonna do right?)",Negative
"i'll take that as a compliment, thanks :) and by the way, i was just fined once. not quite sure what ""often"" means to you, but there you go.",Positive
"running has a positive externality, it makes others want to do the same and reduces the total healthcare costs that the individual would impose on the system over their lifetime. smoking does the complete opposite.",Positive
pretty sure a park was closed because too many people wanted to run there instead.and you wanna sponsor treadmills? i'll take one ty.,Positive
the park is crowded. unlikely to have covid if you are running to be honest by the sounds of the symptoms. i try my best when passing people to make a clear 2m gap and stay away at crossings and bus stops. unfortunately it everyone is trying their best to protect others too,Positive
pretty sure covid gets to you first in an aircon environment if you realised no one smoke in aircon places. ya...smlj right?,Positive
very fair proposal. a bit of civic mindedness we can all learn from you.,Positive
"""same as if you‚Äôre drinking."" maybe this. or this ""but yesterday i was doing that (drinking in a corner)"".could be wrong though.",Negative
it's daylight robbery! but really can't beat smoking in the chilly winter under a clear night sky....,Positive
"in that case, i'm a lot more okay with your decision. however, as you mentioned yourself, the issue is if we give exceptions to ppl who can make a right decision, then there will still be a group of ppl who can't make the right decision yet conduct in the same manner.i've seen ppl who light up their cigrattes when walking, but don't smoke as long as they are around ppl (why they want to ""burn"" money is another story). that, to a certain extend, is still acceptable.smoking because you're unaware of ppl around you when you walk, not great but at the very least, you do try to be aware. smoking and walking even when ppl is behind you or many ppl walking around? i think that's unacceptable.my personal preference is i would prefer ppl to just stand and smoke. that way, at least its easier for ppl to avoid, or ppl can just walk faster for that few seconds.i can't judge if 2 to 3m is sufficient. it sounds sufficient, unless wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction",Negative
enjoy your up and coming lung cancer,Positive
"okay can - you all never had runners huffing and puffing all their mouth juices while you stand at a traffic light with them, or giving you a nice exhale as you walk in the opposite direction. that‚Äôs okay. i mean, stadium tracks are fake one, real runners don‚Äôt use them because they rather run on road.keep playing up the fitspo wannabes. have fun.",Positive
"i can imagine. i was in perth in june a couple years back. clear skies, cool weather. missing it so much now. but u hardly see people smoking in australia as well. i remember years ago you could buy cigarettes off a vending machine.",Positive
"the ""burn"" money part? ask most smokers (or at least many i personally know of), and we ourselves are disgusted by this habit. but you know; vices be vices, and for many, smoking is a coping mechanism that we just stopped trying to get out of, because there's no longer a point in doing so.  as smokers, walking while smoking gives us something to do with our hands (or oral fixation, if you subscribe to freud). it's inherent for many of us, though we all have our own reasons for doing so. i walk while i smoke, yes, but i also cover my cigarette with hand so others don't see it, and the smoke is somewhat contained within my palm and wrist. hey, learned something new didn't ya?  2m - 3m isn't exactly far enough. even 5m (which the authorities use as its yardstick for bus stops and schools) isn't enough. smoke has a way of finding its way around regardless.  all that said, and as much as the thread here agrees with designated smoking corners and keeping the ""evil smokers"" away, allow me to present a different perspective, using the orchard designated smoking points (dsps) as an example.  a) i've had a couple of friends commented (who are non-smokers), that this could be considered discrimination (or demeaning, even) against smokers. that is entirely up for debate.  b) i've a friend who was smoking at one of the orchard dsps when this individual and their child were staring at them, with the said individual stating to their child to never be like them while pointing at the smokers.  now, i can agree with you that the majority of smokers make the rest of us look bad, but does it mean that someone like me (who has his own set of rules to abide by), should be subjected to the unnecessary wrath of op and many of the commenters here, who have already sentenced me to damnation in the tiny heads of theirs? ask yourself, is it right, or fair to me?",Positive
"or copd, or literally any other type of cancer. thanks for the well wishes, dude.",Positive
"nah, i am not saying smoking is burning money. i'm saying ppl who light up their cigratte while walking yet hv the morality not to smoke. they light up despite a lot of ppl around them. isn't that just wasting the cigratte?",Positive
it's just brainless to reduce frequency by a similar percentage as reduction in ridership. end up can expect they will blame citizens again for not maintaining safe distance.,Negative
time for khaw boon wah to wrack his brains again....wait........ he didn‚Äôt have the foresight to see this happening?,Neutral
very unprofessional and amateur to reduce frequencies for all time slots. it doesn't work for peak hours. restore high frequencies for peak hours. do whatever they want for non-peak hours. it's as simple as that.,Positive
"they definitely have the information, resources, and means to do so properly, someone didn't double check their homework.with all the information lta receives from transitlink cards you'd expect they know how to manage it better, apparently not. pay cut incoming.",Positive
">these adjustments will help to mitigate the significant financial impact caused by the reduced riderships, and help keep public transport operations financially sustainable.can't keep making temasek holdings lose money, however, lta should ensure the reduction in frequency is proportional to the reduction in ridership and reduction in passenger capacity at any given timings.",Positive
something something public transport but private company,Neutral
"yeah, i think this is a bad call. even compared to the rest of the decisions they have made in the previous two months, this particular decision seems 100% backwards in the steps taken to reduce transmission.it would be different if ridership has really reduced to the point where cutting frequencies by this amount would not lead to crowded trains/stations, but that's clearly not the case.",Negative
"im not usually a proactive person, but seeing this has made me feel really disappointed in the decision making process in lta. i have submitted feedback regarding this matter on the lta website. hopefully action can be taken soon.",Negative
i wish the frequency would remain as it uses to be. it helps my colleagues and i (healthcare workers) get a bit more rest and reach home earlier after a long shift! please appreciate us in a way that makes a difference.,Positive
peak hour should retain the normal frequencies. off peak maybe can reduce frequency.,Positive
well i‚Äôm in the train right now and it‚Äôs even more crowded than it was the past few days.,Positive
"just heard on the channel 8 news giving fake news... morning commuters all adhering to the safety distancing stickers. what i saw was everyone rushing into the train, standing on non-sticker spots, even after the train ambassadors reminded them they still didn't budge. positive news reporting only?",Negative
"yes, they shouldn't reduce the frequency, especially at peak hours...but, you know what irritates me about these mrt crowd pictures? at least half the crowd does not look to be essential workers going to/from work. so many shorts and slippers. i mean, there's a chance a few of them are going to change into uniform when they arrive, but there are way too many people taking public transport to do stupid things.",Negative
"they shouldn't reduce. my indonesian friend was just saying how dumb their gov was for reducing the frequency of public transport earlier on, causing longer queues and more packed buses/ trains. doesn't really make sense for us to do the same because we have to do social distancing now, reducing frequency means there will be more people queuing.",Positive
"are both train and bus frequencies decreased or only trains? iirc, buses only had some services suspended.",Neutral
"mrt not for peak hours for sure, but non-peak maybe.",Positive
i think this is happening in many countries as well. i could only assume 1 reason of why gov do this.it is far easier to reduce or stop the frequency of train and bus rather than increasing the frequency right?and they cannot stop it for sure because there are some essential workers.on another side i doubt that gov / transport company have the resources / capabilities to increase the frequency in all lane at the same time,Positive
"guise give it a break. we don't know the costs behind running all these transport infrastructure so why are we pretending that we can say with such certainty that cutting transport frequency is a ""stupid"" move? if this is gonna go on for months or even a year don't you think cost would be a big factor and it isn't that unfathomable to attempt to see how a organisation could cut back on service operations? it's a new situation and it's so easy to criticise. of course there'll be some policy stumbles/adjustments and i just don't get why people like to insult the public service so much sigh.",Negative
no. etheir increase the frequency as much as possible or stop it altogether.,Positive
"okay ah, not very crowded leh. have you seen crowded before?",Positive
govt can do no wrong. singaporeans at fault.,Negative
we don't have the luxury of hindsight. i'm sorry.,Negative
"they know the numbers, thats why the decrease in frequency is worked out to match that! its like they are still in transport planner mode (passengers number drop = reduce frequency) and not the common sense pandemic fighting mode (don‚Äôt reduce frequency).",Negative
i agree with you.,Neutral
"thank you very much! a colleague of mine told me about the actual smrt feedback system on their webpage as well. i was intending to send one tomorrow, but i'm relieved someone has done it.",Positive
"yes! it doesn't affect me as much because i could intentionally miss a few trains, but thinking of the front line healthcare workers make my heart ache :( jiayous you can get through this.",Negative
"why doesn't it make sense?whenever things doesn't make sense, think cost and profits.everything will start to make sense then.",Neutral
"other countries is total lockdown and car is actually cheap there.  ours is circuit breaker and cars here is expensive they dont need to increase frequency, just maintain the frequency",Negative
"> we don't know the costs behind running all these transport infrastructure so why are we pretending that we can say with such certainty that cutting transport frequency is a ""stupid"" move?penny wise, pound foolish? increase exposure of tens of thousands still commuting daily, increases chances of local transmission, increases virus exposure in singapore, long term and long economic impact. this is the one time where i really have to say surely someone in lta should have stood up to say that something wasn't right with the policy.",Positive
"isn‚Äôt smrt nationalised again by our government so that costs no longer becomes an issue over necessity? isn‚Äôt necessity far more important than profits?the government can increase subsidy to the two companies running such an essential national service, so that it doesn‚Äôt compromise our pandemic defence. to bring profit to the table reeks of noone wanting to be the gentleman here and do the right thing. this crisis is the best time to see the government doing its job, the best advertisement for elections, and they want to do the same old shit again?",Positive
"i'm not criticising them in any manner, of course the government would implement a policy for a reason. i tried to sound neutral as much as possible in my post. i'm taking a side but i'm not hurling any insults anywhere.what i wanted to do is raise awareness of the actual situation. as what u/jmzyn mentioned, lta chiefs probably don't take public transport. my wish is only that they do not reduce frequency during peak hours. off peak when nobody is in a rush, when it's not crowded, one train can come in 10 minutes and i wouldn't mind the wait.",Positive

"my stand is that drivers should have stronger mitigating factors. if the pedestrian was jaywalking into a driver's blindspot, and if proven true by roadside cctvs or other video footage, the driver should be fully innocent.it's not fair for the driver if someone blatantly jaywalks and hurts themselves. if you willingly walk across oncoming traffic for the sake of convenience, you should automatically sign a 'non-verbal agreement' that your own life is your own responsibility and no one else's. however if a driver collides with a pedestrian crossing on a pedestrian's greenlight, then of course the fault fully lies with the driver. of course, i'm not saying the victim in this case was jaywalking. we'll have to wait for the investigation results to find out.",Positive

"yeah, but in this scenario the blindspot is on the opposite side of traffic with a large vehicle also waiting to do a discretionary right turn (hence the blindspot - can‚Äôt see oncoming traffic). i‚Äôve seen my fair share of drivers dashing out the moment they *think* it‚Äôs clear, only to get blared at by oncoming traffic that was hidden from view.",Positive

"i cycle very often, and never have i experienced any issue with bus drivers. every single time they wanted to come out of a bus stop or change lane, they've always waited for me to pass before doing so.  perhaps you had one or more bad experiences (and i'm sorry for that) but that's being very disrespectful and xenophobic. every bus driver i've seen have been gracious to me on a bike.",Negative
i was with you then you brought up nationality bruh,Neutral
wow nice assumptions you have about bus drivers working in singapore.,Positive
you ignorant bastard.,Neutral
i don't factor these in. i simply assume that they are actively trying to fall over in front of me and drive accordingly.,Neutral
the bus max speed limit is 60km/h and no sane bus driver will want to go near that. the buses drive ah their speed by design.,Positive
bus captains in singapore have to adhere to their schedule as far as possible and cannot be too close to the bus that is ahead. they will know if they have to speed up or slow down.,Negative

"i've done the very same, cycling on driving paths in singapore, and almost gotten into an altercation with a larger vehicle comparing who has the right of way, on driving etiquette, etc.at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter if an accident takes place. i could be the cyclists with the most rights in the world and every single law in the book on my side. but if a lorry or car or whatever hits me and i end up in the blue tent, does it matter if i'm right? maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. i'm not going to stick around and place the value of me being correct above my own life.until something is done on the policy end to protect cyclists on the road, i would prefer to do quality risk assessment before putting my life in the hands of drivers who probably can't even see me most of the time.",Positive
yes that's why it could benefit both if we could learn from other nations are consider cycling lanes perhaps?,Negative
i do not have enough information to say who is at fault but i am pointing out that there is a need for a review on road usage by cyclists. for both their safety and ours.,Neutral

"as a driver, yes. you should give way to buses and heavy vehicles first.edit: why the downvotes?you want to fight a bus for the lane or priority for a turn? nuts. i'd rather yield to the big bus with the larger blind spot first as they will require more room to manoeuvre. never fight a vehicle bigger than yours",Positive
thats my point.so the driver also committed murder right? will face life in prison death penalty?,Positive
"i think im a very observant bastard.singapore bus drivers ain't what they used to be.the ones from the mainland scare me shitless because they are used  to driving a certain way over there, that does not respect the sanctity of human life....at least that's my opinion, and im not going to change it due to some virtue signalling by the 'woke' crowd.",Negative

"the problem with road users in general, is that their attitude is often based around their perception of who has the ""right"" to do something. this flies in the face of defensive road use.the problem with being a cyclist, is that if you have an accident, regardless of who is right, you're probably coming out worse off than the person driving a heavy metallic cage.so yeah, a re-think about how to get people moving around safely, and attitudes towards it, would be good. there's no room for self-entitlement when safety is concerned.",Positive

a bulge.,Neutral
"more information has been released already, check those facebook pages/ groups that always report sg roads and accidents.having the right of way means that his mistakes are caused by the actions of others. you having the right of way and knocking into someone that barge into your road is a mistake that is caused by the other person. it considered careless driving instead of reckless driving. of course if you drive at 100kmh at a school zone that's not a right of way lolregardless of who has the right, the vehicle will always get penalised anyway.",Positive

"to be fair, i think that's how they fuck up, they assume this was going to be another sars, behaving how it did in 2003.2003 sars spread mainly when [symptoms started to appear, shorter incubation period (2 to 7 days)](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/faq.html) and overall it was a [less contagious virus](https://youtu.be/cxfb2okvzds). making it easy to control. by the time the disease has reach its infectious stage in humans, the victim will be too ill to move about, further reducing the spread. hence, a significant number of cases in the 2003 sars outbreak was healthcare workers than members of the public.but covid 19 is a different beast entirely, it has a high rate of presymptomatic and asymptomatic spread, [longer incubation period (2 to 14 days)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus). allowing the virus to slip by basic disease control measures (temperature screening, limited travel restrictions etc).for h1n1, is more we are lucky because the disease was so mild. during the 2009 pandemic, it was estimated more than [400,000 people were infected here but we only suffered 18 fatalities](https://www.gov.sg/article/when-was-the-last-time-singapore-activated-dorscon-orange).",Positive

"having this issue too on xiaomi 9t and 10t pro, mine will not work at all for public transport but works perfectly fine everywhere else, my current solution that works for me now is to remove all apps that use nfc other than google pay (for me that was the uob bank app). tried a lot of the solutions such as changing wallets, installing older version of gpay, adding removing cards but didn‚Äôt work for me, highly believe this is a software issue not a hardware problem with the phone or bank cards.",Positive

no because there are limits to how many people can fit in this country.also no one is arguing for open borders? like you can both advocate not telling new immigrants to fuck off (which is just both xenophobic and hypocritical give our history) while recognising the practical limits of infrastructure development and social integration. these aren't inherent contradictory.it's not either or dude. you don't need to hate crime immigrants just because you don't support open borders.,Positive
what are you on about? he never said anything about border control.,Neutral
"whatever he said. stop using the slippery slope argument. it is a fallacy. you can have reasonable policies that don't automatically result in open-borders. on the point of us, this is like the gun-control argument there. it goes from *can we have checks on who is owning an assault rifle* to *liberals are stealing our inherent right to bear guns* without considering the fact that many countries have a thriving gun culture without having mass shootings.",Positive
">also no one is arguing for open borders?really?so why did op saw fit to muddy the waters by mentioning how one's ancestors are fellow immigrants then? what bearing does that have on today's border policies?for that matter, why are you so ready to denigrate those in support of such policies (immigrants to fuck off) ""xenophobic and hypocritical"" then? what bearing does that have in the discourse of recognizing ""the practical limits of infrastructure development and social integration""?",Positive

"why did you even bring up border policies? this article is about an asshole literally spitting in the face of an immigrant while asking her if she's from china.that's the context in which he said that singaporeans' ancestors are immigrants. it's obviously a call to empathise with the victim by calling out our commonalities.nowhere did he even talk about border policies. he's condemning an asshole who committed a hate crime. why did you even see the need to fight him?and telling immigrants to fuck off, which is the example i gave, is not ""discourse"" about infrastructure developments and social integration. neither is spitting in the faces of immigrants. telling an immigrant""fuck off we don't want you here"" is a xenophobic and hypocritical hate crime. saying ""we need to lower limits on the rate of immigration"" is not.",Negative

"i think empathizing with why they're frustrated in the first place counts as such, yes? have i condoned any physical violence, nope.the act itself isn't. drawing some irrelevant connection between the victim and the public sans perpetrator is. so you're conflating both. e.g. op insinuating that we should empathize with the victim because our previous generations were once immigrants too is guilt tripping.>the empathy is just to help us better understand how the victim felt. it gets us closer to the truth compared to if we saw immigrants as totally alien and distinct from us.all well and good and one is free to exercise one's liberty whether to empathize or not. but you don't get to sit on your high horse tossing ""xenophobic"" labels around, vilifying those who don't.",Positive

"i'm tossing it at the guy who spit on the woman and people who tell immigrants ""fuck off"".i don't think that's wrong. if people hate immigrants they should just admit to it. xenophobia is hatred towards foreigners, and the hatred can step from unhappiness about immigration policies and grievances about loss of jobs. doesn't make it not xenophobia if someone literally hates immigrants. i mean that's the definition.",Negative

immigrants back then contributing to the formative years of a nation are fundamentally different from immigrants of today. the former carried the nation on their backs by doing jobs that either weren't desirable or were in demand of labour.same can't be said for today's migrants entering an **already developed nation** when they're displacing jobs that locals can also do while concurrently driving wages down. and we're not even addressing migrants who treat this place as a stepping stone.comparing them both is disingenuous at best - see false equivalence.,Positive
"so the test of whether it's a fair comparison just whether the person suffered enough while working in singapore? why is that morally or logically relevant? are you saying that modern immigrants are somehow more deserving of hate crimes and less deserving of empathy just because they weren't as destitute as immigrants in the 40s? like they're too successful to be seen as deserving empathy?and you know that there were rich businessmen that came over in the 40s too right. would you say that these people are more similar to modern immigrants then? would you empathise with them less, if they had suffered from a hate crime in the 40s? how about migrant workers working in singapore today working under some of the worst working conditions in sg and receiving super low wages? why are they not comparable to migrant workers working in the 40s? do you really think that construction work today is a lot more desirable than being a dock worker in the 40s? hell we continue to hire foreigners to do dock work. it's literally the same job. and coolies in the 40s also obviously depressed local wages. it's the same economic forces at work.also i assure you that my parents went through their fair share of shit before they got their pr and citizenship. if what you value above all else is whether someone worked in undesirable jobs in singapore, then i assure that a lot immigrants that came to singapore in the 90s had their fair share of it, before the government made immigration a more elitist affair in the past decade.and if what matters above all else is suffering for the country, don't we need to ask, what have you and i suffered? i am 200% more easily accepted as a singaporean than my parents simply because i was fortunate enough to be brought up here, but i've suffered far less than they did for this country. i've never had to work at a shitty underpaid job just to try to get pr. citizenship is something that i never had to earn. it's given to me as a right. if what mattered above all else is suffering for the country, then by that logic there would be local born singaporeans, especially those who go on to spend the rest of their lives away from singapore, who are less deserving of empathy than immigrants.",Positive
"not what i said but nice strawman. i'm saying it's irrelevant to bring up comparisons between immigrants of different eras when judging racial/xenophobic incidents today.you know that businessmen, few and far between compared to today, got rich by investing in the country back then right? and you do know that businessmen of today instead got rich elsewhere and are using sg as a tax haven right? again, their contributions don't compare so stop trying.you're now conflating migrant worker types: foreign workers (fw - low income jobs) and foreign talent (ft - mid to high income jobs). we don't need the latter, we very much appreciate the former. dock work is still done by maritime graduates from local trade and technical schools btw.re: suffering. are you being wilfully dense? immigrants of today are being offered a silver platter to be here compared to 1st gen. immigrants given the soft immigration policies since decades past. so really, what is your reference for the perceived ""suffering"" and ""shit"" you think your parents went through?also i'm not sure why you're unable to compartmentalize our discussion from your emotions. are you feeling attacked somewhat because your parents are 2nd gen. immigrants? do you then feel the need to defend all subsequent immigrants without consideration to how easy it is to get a pr status in recent years? if you're a male and at least served national service here then we're talking at cross purposes. have you?",Negative
"i grew up in sg and served ns, but i don't see how this is relevant.why is it irrelevant to bring up older generations when it comes to xenophobia and hate crimes? is xenophobia and hate crimes more ok towards modern immigrants than older generation of immigrants just because modern immigrants had it easier? modern society is easier on everyone compared to the past, for both immigrants and locals. is it ok to call a black person the n word as long as he's rich? if not, why is more ok to be xenophobic towards immigrants today compared to older immigrant just because newer immigrants are richer? what has having it easier got to do with whether you should be subject to xenophobia and hate crimes. should you be subject to more hate crimes and xenophobia just because the government made easier to get pr? why? even if we had open borders we still shouldn't have hate crimes. by your logic the more oepn our borders then more xenophobic we should be is it? then what if really open borders we start murdering people? or spit in their face? i've asked this twice. please answer this specifically.i also don't agree with your weird ass assumptions about immigrants at all. what silver platter? my dad had a masters from a selective university but had to work in a factory as a machinist in the 90s, before slowly rising through the ranks. my mum was running the branch office of a regional bank but ended up becoming a kindergarden teacher when she came over. this idea that that all immigrants are rich expats is absolutely ridiculous. go and read up on some basic stats. the vast majority of new citizens to singapore are malaysians, most of whom didn't come in as rich expats. s pass holders used to also be able to get citizenship. the idea that new citizens are all rich is a super recent phenomenon, and it's a direct result of the government heavily raising the criteria for pr and citizenship.",Positive
"what are you even on about? contributing to the defence of the nation and fostering bonds between fellow locals is irrelevant? you're just arguing for the sake of arguing now.your argument is also over the place and filled with fallacies. xenophobia and hate crimes don't always go hand in hand together. for instance i can be against the idea of foreigners whilst not being hostile to them (as i've proven above) so false equivalence again. stop trying to escalate the severity of xenophobia experienced here when 1) there are worse places to be 2) murders don't even happen on a regular basis let alone against foreigners for xenophobic reasons. i'm more curious why you think xenophobia isn't justified when policies are threatening local job security.i've already answered i condemn all sorts of violence twice earlier btw, to which you acknowledged. so what am i not answering?re: silver platter doesn't apply to all immigrants duhh but nice try with the strawman. you saw fit to compare immigrants of today to those in the past and sg is a tax haven for the rich to bypass tax laws today, this wasn't present in the past. you should know this if you're a citizen actually, that or you're living under a rock. not to mention some immigrants don't have to serve national service either so again silver platter.still waiting on a response to my question about why you feel attacked personally btw.",Positive
"ok set aside hate crimes. let's just talk about hate then, which is what xenophobic is. why is it ok to hate newer immigrants just because they have it easier than older immigrants? why would someone be more deserving of hate just because our government changed our own immigration policy? immigrants are just trying to make a living. they're not a evil malevolent force out to eat your babies. if you don't like the policy, hate the government. my parents are not the pap. i already told you most modern immigrants are nowhere rich enough to be here only for tax benefits. they're mostly malaysians here for better job opportunities. also once again, tax policy is controlled by our government. if you hate that we have low taxes, hate the government. why does us having low taxes justify hating immigrants? if our government raises taxes, would you hate immigrants less? if the government lowers tax by 1%, then hate then 1% more? what's the moral relevance of our tax and whether you should hate immigrants?pioneer generation of immigrants didn't serve ns. you think goh chok tong served ns? by your logic you should hate that generation. guess who actually did serve ns? me. the modern immigrant. who else? every single pr who came before the age of 18. and setting that aside, what has ns got to do with whether someone deserves hate? women don't serve ns, doesn't mean we should hate women.dude wtf isn't it glaringly obvious why i am against xenophobia? holy shit like i dont want people to hate me and my parents. i don't want people to call me ah tiong just because i've a hanyinyin surname. i don't want people to hate me so much ths they feel compelled to spit on me on the bus. why is that so hard to understand?and please don't question my citizenship just because i know that most immigrants aren't tax avoiders. as though all singaporeans must agree with your warped sense of what immigrants are like just to be real citizens.",Negative
"yes, let's.didn't i already addressed the main reason for xenophobia is job security? how else do you think the govt. is going to gauge ground sentiments when they readily turn a blind eye on the matter by deflecting criticisms with ""xenophobia/racist"" claims? and you do know that not all immigrants are willing to integrate into the society they chose to reside in right? hence the frustration with their ivory towers? again, why is this news to you?doesn't matter - more rich immigrants seeking tax refuge here relative to the past. also, threatening to displace jobs for locals (see above). regurgitating how you think contemporary immigrants don't have it all that good is myopic at best when the stats show otherwise.pioneer gen. don't have to serve you say? more lies.pioneers - ""**born on or before 31 december 1949**‚Äã aged 65 and above in 2014.""inception of ns - ""goh announced that an *initial batch* of some 9,000 male youths **born between 1 january 1949 and 30 june 1949** would be eligible to be called up for ns.""re: xenophobia or or or...bout time you come to terms that 1) attacks aren't levelled against you obviously so stop victimizing yourself for some deluded cause you think you're championing for 2) immigrants themselves don't serve ns 3) plenty are using sg as a stepping stone in modern context 4) even if immigrants are angels and will play by the rules here, there are too many being allowed in the floodgates. not rocket science",Positive

"sure i can address job security. why does lack of job security justify hating immigrants? i didn't miss your earlier point.are you saying that the only way to make your voices heard about job security is to spread hate about immigrants? that's dumb. labour movements exist around the world - are you saying that all of them require hating immigrants as an essential component? i don't care if you personally draw arbitrary distinctions between different generations of immigrants, with zero actual morally relevant reasons (i said 4 times that newer immigrants having it easier is not a morally relevant distinction). you're basically saying, older generations of immigrants are different because of this particular feature you picked, which is not relevant at all to whether someone deserves hatred. i might as well say that younger generations of immigrants are better because they are wealthier and contribute more to the gdp, and therefore you should hate older generations more. isn't that a dumbass argument? it's a random arbitrary difference that has zero relevance to whether someone deserves hate.not serving ns doesn't make you deserve hatred. can you at least admit that? my father didn't serve ns because he came over in his 30s, just as pioneer generations of immigrants who came over in their 30s also didn't serve ns. neither deserves hatred.by the way you said the stats would prove you right about your view of the the average immigrants but i'm not seeing the stats. if we're just comparing anedcotes i know easily 7 8 families, including my own, and none of them match the kind of shit that you've been ascribing to immigrants (ie tax avoiding rich fucks living in ivory tower yet somehow simultaneously depressing wages).",Positive
"so you're ""addressing"" my question with another question? have you considered running for office? but i'll be the bigger man and go first, you can address some of my claims below for a start:because foreigners are 1) displacing jobs that can be done equally by locals and 2) driving wages down while also 3) allowing money to bleed out of the country by sending back to their hometown. 4) certain cases of foreigners in hr positions play favorites with their countrymen.your didn't miss my point earlier yet you chose not to address it until i repeatedly called you out on it. your other mistake is believing ""labour movement"" (ntuc headed by ccs prior if you didn't already know) here isn't already entrenched by office holders with a pro-immigration agenda. it wasn't until many voiced out their discontent harshly did that lead to improvement of labour laws e.g. [enforced hiring practices](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mp-moots-law-to-tackle-hiring-bias-protect-local-workers). tune in to the news every once awhile buddy.you're invoking morality on behalf of immigrants who may choose to settle down here and not for your fellow countrymen who are here by default. why the double standards here? why aren't you displaying empathy for locals who have lost their jobs to immigrants? what about their family and kids? who's going to take care of them?no i can't (except older generation of migrants).ns has empirically shown to deny opportunity cost to the citizen and thus devalue their competitive standards against the immigrants they're competing with for employment. some stats on your end proving otherwise would be nice.",Positive
"ok actually there's really no point arguing further because you don't even agree with me on fundamental things like when it is morally wrong to hate someone. like women and older gen immigrants in their 30s all dont serve ns but you just flat out state that for them ns isn't morally relevant, but for new immigrants not serving ns means they deserve hatred. there's just no logic or consistency in how you decide whether someone deserves hatred. you start with immigrants deserve hatred, almost axiomatically, then everything else is just post hoc justification.to be fair to you, i am essentially like you but on the other end of the argument. i will admit that i will never ever agree with you that immigrants deserve hatred and xenophobia. let's just end this argument here and enjoy the rest of our weekends doing something more worthwhile than internet arguments.",Positive

"this group has been identified as the zouk family. this family was supposedly founded by a female that's believed to be from the bishan family, and a lone male that's suspected to be from the marina family. previously, he had been seen in various areas around town, like the botanic gardens, tanglin, orchard, and kim seng. so they're already a lot more urbanised compared to other clans living in other parts of singapore.they're known as the zouk family because the first litter of pups was born along the singapore river, near jiak kim bridge, at the end of 2018. this group, comprising the parents ('zouk mum' and 'zouk dad'), 3 pups, and an adult female that's believed to be the mother's sister ('zouk aunt'), were eventually driven away from the area in may 2019 by the bishan family, popped up along [bukit timah road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/otters-spotted-at-bukit-timah-group-fled-from-singapore-river-home-due-to-bishan-otters) and alexandra canal, then returned to the singapore river for a while.in june 2019, they [stopped traffic in the cbd](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/family-otters-attempt-cross-road-central-business-district), then fled to rochor canal. after that incident, the zouk family was found along bukit timah road. zouk mum was wounded, but was still active enough that she eluded a rescue attempt, and zouk aunt was missing. it's not known whether the group had been attacked by a rival family, or if there was some internal conflict, but as the remaining 5 members of the zouk family continued wandering about places like rochor canal, singapore river, and the botanic gardens, a lone female otter with injuries was seen along the bukit timah and alexandra canals, and subsequently identified as the missing zouk aunt. she paired up with a lone male, and eventually recovered. a few months later, zouk aunt finally crossed paths with the rest of the zouk family along the singapore river, but it was not a happy reunion. there was a fight between her and her sister, and she was driven away. so the former zouk aunt and her partner have been keeping to themselves, mostly staying out of the way of the other families; one possible encounter was in may 2020, when u/hanamihoshi saw [a pair of otters in kallang](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/grkeoh/happy_world_otter_day_heres_a_video_of_2_cheeky/). at the end of 2019, the rest of the zouk family made a den in the botanic gardens, and had a second litter. 6 pups were born, but 3 pups died from malnourishment. subsequently, as the remaining pups grew up, the zouk family started wandering out of the botanic gardens, and another young pup went missing. this family of 7 was seen in more areas; for example, the otters seen by u/sleeplessathome [doing laps in the pool at park infinia](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ff8d6n/otters_invade_condo_steal_koi_fish_bring_to_pool/) were identified as the zouk family, and they were spotted at nearby [tan tock seng hospital](https://mothership.sg/2020/03/otters-tan-tock-seng-hospital/). during the circuit breaker, the zouk otters made notable appearances at the [shell station along bukit timah road](https://mothership.sg/2020/04/otters-bukit-timah-shell-station/), [kk hospital](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/otter-kk-womens-childrens-hospital/), and [little india](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/family-of-otters-frolicking-outside-mustafa-centre-is-looking-for-a-permanent-home). they travelled up to bishan-ang mo kio park, [fought the marina otters](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/otters-fight-bishan-ang-mo-kio-park/), and possibly [raided the ponds at jazreel low's spa](https://www.todayonline.com/8days/sceneandheard/celebrities/former-actress-jazreel-low-doesnt-want-otters-ate-over-100-her) there. after the circuit breaker, u/blackchilli saw them [outside plaza singapura](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hdl50l/otters_at_plaza_singapura/) in june, and pm lee wrote [about otters at the istana](https://mothership.sg/2020/06/pm-lee-otters-istana/) - turns out that it was the zouk family.by the end of 2020, they were back at the botanic gardens, and had a 3rd litter of 7 pups. and now they're venturing out of the gardens again, exploring the rest of their territory; they've popped up at dempsey, queensway, [penang road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/otterly-delightful-surprise-for-office-workers-at-penang-road), and as this video shows, went to the istana again. right now they're back at the singapore river.while the bishan family has been the most famous family for several years, right now it seems that the zouk family has been getting the most public attention as they try to navigate the city.",Positive

"one thing i like to talk about is how the transitioning works. its cool! the idea of this transition is that smrt will run their yishun services until 2am on 5 sep, and then three hours later, when another new day starts at 5am, 5 sep, the same buses will come out on service, but as tower transit buses. basically, a lot of things happen between 2am and 5am that day. note that this is based on how transitions worked over the past few years at bulim, loyang, and seletar and a friend who has also experienced a similar transition as a bus captain. buses: all buses are owned by lta, so transfer of ownership isn't an issue. tower transit already has a small fleet of buses allocated to them by lta when they moved in to the new depot earlier this year. these buses are sufficient for training, etc., but not enough to run the services, so smrt will have to transfer those buses to them. by this time, many of the yishun smrt buses you see already have ""smrt"" word removed from their internal stickers like ""thank you for travelling with smrt"" or ""welcome aboard smrt"". on the morning of 4 sep, some of the buses destined to transfer to tower transit will have the ""smrt"" brand removed from the buses. when the buses finish their duty on that day (can be as early as 7pm or as late as 2am depending on shift), they will be driven directly to tower transit's depot at mandai where technicians will inspect them and then paste tower transit stickers. the transfer of buses is complete. interchanges: as part of the bus package, tower will also be taking over the management of yishun and sembawang interchanges. note that yishun interchange is shared with sbs transit who has more services there, but the interchange will be managed by tower transit. the logistics of the transition may have already been planned long long time ago, all concerning that crucial 3-hour period between 2am and 5am. at 2am, after the last smrt buses finish their day, they will move out of the interchange office, taking away all their own equipment, furniture, etc. (some may be moved at a later date, but i'm not sure about that). then, tower transit will move in to the office and bring in their equipment. and then there's those smrt brands i.e. signboards, stickers, etc. those may or may not be changed that night, but at the very least, a tower transit sticker will be pasted over them. staff: as part of the transition, some of the smrt staff (especially drivers) will also go to tower transit. tower transit may have already recruited their own staff, but they are also required to take in smrt's staff that are affected by the change in operator. transfer of staff is much simpler in terms of logistics. staff destined to be transferred to tower transit would have been briefed on admin stuff months prior, and may have already collected their uniform and standard issue items beforehand. therefore, it is just a simple matter of reporting to work on 4 sep as smrt staff, and on the next day, you wear your new uniform and report to work as tower transit staff. according to what my friend said, when you are transferred to the new operator this way, your years of service with previous operator is still recognised. you get to keep your rank/job grade (converted to equivalent rank/grade in the company). your pay and benefits remain the same. your leave entitlements remain the same as before. so if smrt paid you a higher allowance than tower pays to their staff, you will still receive the same allowance as you have received before in smrt.",Negative

"""bukit batok""main reason is buses want, or rather, need to keep to their schedule.now, the traffic lights in bukit batok, especially around the central area are horribly timed, causing inefficiencies and unnecessary traffic backlog. thus, particularly during peak hours, buses along bukit batok end up delayed as they require extra time in bukit batok.as for buses moving forward while waiting for green lights, more often than not is that buses are anticipating the lights to turn green so that they will be able to move as soon as the lights turn green. since the drivers frequently drive their routes, they would no doubt be familiar with the traffic lights conditions and roughly know when the lights turn green.regarding drivers who horn when the light just turns green, usually these drivers are already delayed and would appreciate the vehicle in front to move, so that they can catch up on their schedule. but indeed, they probably shouldn't horn just as the lights turn green as that could come across as impatient and that extra second probably wouldn't matter much, unless the vehicle in front takes their time.",Negative

"again, you fail to explain why this is a problem.we know that the virus is circulating silently. this happened in bukit merah, it happened in the ktv and fishery, and it's happening now in bugis. as more and more people get vaccinated, we can only expect more and more cases to slip under the radar and more people to be asymptomatically infected. this, however, poses no threat to our community and medical system. when 95% of vaccinated breakthrough infections don't even show symptoms, most of our people will not even realize we have the virus, let along require medical attention or a hospital bed.during our recovery, cases will go up. when we reopen, transmission rates will rise, especially imported once when borders open. what's important is that the virus no longer poses a threat to our society with the current vaccination rate, and the transition to a post-pandemic world will be one with minimal suffering to our people.",Positive
yep surveillance testing is important to identify those carriers who are infected to prevent onward transmission. feel like it's a common misconception that endemic = open all gates/don't care. it's quite concerning here though because it seems we weren't able to identify the cluster before it had spread to a big chunk of the close contacts. maybe we need to test these frontline workers more regularly,Positive

"i do get where u are coming from, but im coming from the assumption1) drivers wear masks and doesnt really touch the other parts of the bus when he/she is driving2) cleaning of the bus is prolly done with proper cleaning tools such as gloves so drivers wont be touching bus surfaces bare handed.",Positive
"what do you mean by 'again'. i believe this was the first time i replied to you on this or am i mistaken?my view is that while we cannot claim that the virus will not spread if we do everything prescribed, not doing things as recommended definitely doesn't help.this is not just true for covid, even before covid people should in theory rest at home and not go to work or go around when sick. this is just simple public health and hygiene. unfortunately, i know many people do not have the luxury of doing so and as in the case of the flu, you see one guy sick in office today.. a few days later another few are sniffling.we've taken this as normal for so long, it wouldn't take much to revert back.i'm all for opening up. but the one thing i feel that should never go back is how we go back to having fevers and running our noses all over our work. i know often people have no choice for work, but even leisure activities where have a sore throat is detrimental, i have encountered people who turn up regardless. i understand people are literally dying to open up, but why can't we open up safely... like not ignoring symptoms? hence, this to me is exactly a problem.",Positive
"i think usually people will be on weekly or 14 day surveillance. if we feel safe and do things cos we feel it's safe..   7 days is plenty to infect.i don't think it's a good idea to increase the frequency of tests though, that's very resource intensive and may not have the intended roi.",Positive
"at this point i will be more surprised than not that i have not been exposed previously. on that note, anecdotally, i was the close contact of a close contact to a positive case. i was mentally prepared to be quarantined. in the end my close contact who was quarantined turned out to be negative throughout. vaccine worked for him as his friend was sniffling when they met.",Positive
that's for covid. but wouldn't it be good if our society can support better hygiene practices (yes i know some people just cannot take mc) so that when other infectious disease come round like the seasonal flu... we won't all have the sniffles?,Positive

"you implied it in the parent comment, where you challenged pm's statement that the situation was under control with the severity of the disease dropping each day with each vaccine delivered.i agree with your take on general health practices. if you're known to be infected and symptomatic, don't go out spreading the disease. get an mc, take medication, rest until you feel better. it's better for the community, and it's better for your health. i also agree that we should normalize taking mcs even when mildly sick: employers should understand that employee health is important and maintaining a healthy workplace allows for greater satisfaction and productivity.what i disagree with is your overall assessment of the situation. you've asserted that the situation isn't under control, as if natural fluctuations in case counts pose a serious threat to our society. this is simply false, both looking at data locally and overseas. even during our worst outbreak of the year, case severity remained low with no more than 11/1000 icu beds being occupied at one time, and case mortality remains within the expected 1-3% range among the unvaccinated and below 0.1% among the vaccinated. overseas, even as most of europe opened their economy and society with 10-15% lower vaccination rates than us, the horror stories of overloaded hospitals and morgues of 2020 are nowhere to be heard today. the uk, despite a total freedom day on july 19, are seeing over 10x reductions in daily deaths from last year despite cases spreading. in fact, they have seen negative excess deaths from march to july this year compared to before the pandemic. we have gone well past the point of case counts representing the threat posed by the virus. as we emerge from the crisis, case counts will rise, perhaps into the hundreds or even over a thousand. widespread vaccination has allowed our country to accept this safely. few will develop symptoms and even fewer, mostly unvaccinated, will require a hospital bed. the vast majority of us might not even realize it when we catch the disease, going about our daily lives unaware and unaffected.",Positive
why not? something like home antigen kits done twice or thrice a week. that‚Äôs the direction germany are going.,Neutral
of course everyone should have the opportunity to take time off to recover when sick. i also believe you shouldn't be forced to go get an mc if it's a mild illness. waste of time and just risks exposing you to more severe viruses. but let's not forget that our immune system is like a muscle and needs ongoing training to remain strong. i'm worried what 18 months of distancing and masks will do to children in particular.,Negative

"i'm surprised that you picked up so many nuances from my post. i was only talking about people who go to work with symptoms not helping the situation.i  was more thinking about as the situation opens up and people get more relaxed, more people might be more inclined to ignore symptoms, which would then present a problem (as with any infectious disease). i wasn't even thinking about the situation not being under control to be honest.i didn't even challenge pm's statement... i was really honestly just frustrated at people who ignore symptoms.",Positive
i mean... that's good lah .. but i'm not sure i wanna tell people to poke their noses twice a week.....,Positive
"it might be a waste of time if the illness is mild .. but what if it wasn't mild in the end? i've seen cases like where someone continued using an expired inhaler to save money... it no big deal right? so one day during a severe attack, he finally succumbed.someone complaining of a headache but insisted not to go hospital cos it was going to be new year, want to eat reunion dinner that night and all. she didn't make it to reunion dinner that night. but yeah, most of the time it's really mild and i also don't want to go polyclinic wait hours and end up sicker lol. so i just go gp where the wait time is much shorter.but at the very least, if actively having symptoms (not just covid lah) reducing movement would be good.",Positive

"once you get frequency down below 20-30 minutes, it changes from a turn-up-and-go service to one which is infrequent enough that ridership suffers further from the friction from having to match the timetabled arrival times. it's relatively trivial timing leaving your house to meet a bus, but a reverse journey where you have to match transferring from another bus to this service's timetable is way harder.",Negative
"i would still think that it is similar to extrapolate from the $600/day/bus figure. i went to find the spec sheets of bus engines and it seems like that isn‚Äôt a big difference between the fuel consumption of a single decker vs double decker (not an engineer, might not read the fuel consumption curve correctly). tbh, the man brand single decker and double decker uses the same engine...if fuel costs are the bulk of operational costs and if the fuel consumption isn‚Äôt greatly different between sd and dd buses, then it probably doesn‚Äôt matter too much. since 400 only has 3 buses, it costs probably around $750,000/year in 2012 to serve a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù function of linking marina barrage to marina bay mrt. could be about $1-2 million a year nowadays (to get the $7m figure for svc 700, we need to multiply it by 2, so perhaps we can extrapolate the same for svc 400), if there‚Äôs totally no demand, although there no new data to tell though.since oyk did say that they are okay with paying if its actually *critical/vital* to service an area, i think svc 400 is still somewhat reasonable (at least until tel opens).the thing about svc 700 is that it is not critical. its not like removing svc 700 will mean people in bp cannot go to town reasonably quickly enough. using figures quoted from the same site to compare, it takes 23 mins (excluding waiting time) of travel time to take bus from petir road to dtl to nsl to orchard. svc 700 does so in 17 mins (excl. waiting). for some, they can walk to another bus stop nearby (+5 mins walk) for a bus that has only has 13 mins of travel time (excl. waiting).compared to spending maybe up to $2 million/year to service a tourist location that isn‚Äôt otherwise served, spending $7 million/year to save 15 mins of extra walking/waiting just don‚Äôt seem as justifiable. if there‚Äôs 1500 residents using svc 700 daily (enough to pack all 17 buses fully twice a day), its still the equivalent of paying $4500/person/year (or $375/person/month) *to save 15 mins*. few ordinary person would otherwise be willing to pay that large a sum just to save that short amount of time.",Positive

"> # doctor suspended from practice after indecently exposing himself to woman on bus> singapore: a doctor who indecently exposed himself to a woman on a bus has been suspended from practice.> dr azman osman, a doctor with more than 23 years standing, faced a charge of professional misconduct brought by the singapore medical council (smc) after he was convicted in july 2017 of insulting the modesty of a woman.> advertisement> advertisement> in their grounds of decision made available on tuesday (jul 13), a disciplinary tribunal ruled that dr azman should be suspended for four months.> on jul 10, 2016 at about 1.15pm, the doctor was on board an sbs bus when he unzipped his trousers before a 56-year-old woman, and exposed his underwear and groin.> the disciplinary tribunal said dr azman claimed trial despite being offered a choice of a warning by a police officer.> ‚Äúhe maintained his belief that he was justified in his actions due to the provocation of the 56-year-old victim,‚Äù the grounds said.> advertisement> advertisement> ‚Äúaccording to (dr azman), he believed that the victim ‚Ä¶ was a prostitute and he felt provoked by her attire as she was wearing a pair of shorts so revealing that she had exposed her underwear to (him) while sitting and facing him on the sbs bus.> ‚Äútherefore, in retaliation to the perceived provocation, he decided to expose his underwear to the victim.‚Äù> he was convicted in court on jul 18, 2017 after a trial and was sentenced to two weeks‚Äô imprisonment.> about six months later, the smc informed dr azman that the matter was being referred to the disciplinary tribunal. he initially disagreed with the charge brought by the smc, but eventually expressed ‚Äúsincere remorse‚Äù for his actions after receiving legal advice. he also pleaded guilty to the charge.> advertisement> the tribunal referred the matter to a health committee to determine if dr azman was fit to practise as a doctor or if he might be impaired by a medical condition.> the tribunal said his reasoning for exposing himself to the woman was ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù and that the doctor may ‚Äúcontinue with similar reasoning‚Äù when attending to patients.> at a hearing in oct 2018, the tribunal noted that dr azman ‚Äúappeared detached‚Äù from the proceedings and it appeared he had a ‚Äúrather sensitive and labile personality that may be subject to mood swings‚Äù.> an inquiry by the health committee found that the fitness of dr azman to practise was not impaired by reason of his mental condition. furthermore, the committee observed that he was able to explain his behaviour in a ‚Äúrational and cogent manner‚Äù.> ‚Äúeven though (dr azman) held very strong religious views which may have affected the way he reacted, these values would not impair his ability to practise as a medical practitioner or to deal with his patients in an appropriate manner,‚Äù said the tribunal.> in asking for a six- to nine-month suspension, the smc said dr azman demonstrated no insight into the ‚Äúobjectionable nature of his conduct‚Äù nor showed any remorse for his actions.> the act of exposing himself was intentional and an act of retaliation, the council added. it also asked that dr azman should only undertake consultations on female patients with a chaperone present, except in an emergency.> dr azman exposing his underwear and groin to the woman was a ‚Äúdeliberate and calculated move, not a momentary lapse of judgement‚Äù, said the smc, adding that he had ‚Äúbrazenly refused‚Äù to zip up his trousers despite being asked to by the victim and the bus driver.> during the trial, the doctor cast ‚Äúbaseless aspersions‚Äù on the victim and tried to portray himself as the victim, claiming he was provoked by the victim‚Äôs attire, the tribunal heard.> the council said dr azman ‚Äúremained recalcitrant‚Äù even after serving two weeks‚Äô imprisonment as he had initially maintained that his actions were justified.> in defence, dr azman‚Äôs lawyer said the doctor had committed a ‚Äúone-off offence‚Äù and that it was not a premeditated act.> he highlighted dr azman‚Äôs ‚Äúlong unblemished‚Äù track record and said he had pleaded guilty once he had legal advice.> the tribunal said the manner in which he contested his criminal charge was ‚Äúincompatible with the standards of moral integrity expected from members of the medical profession‚Äù.> ‚Äúthe harm to the victim was ‚Äòslight‚Äô since there was no physical contact with the victim and no evidence of permanent harm caused even though the act had caused some emotional distress to the victim,‚Äù the tribunal said in its ruling.> taking into account dr azman‚Äôs state of mind during the offence, the tribunal called it a ‚Äúcalculated and deliberate act‚Äù.> ‚Äúthere was no medical evidence before the dt to suggest that (dr azman) was suffering from any mental condition which would reduce his culpability. he knew what he was doing and he fully intended his action to upset the victim as an act of retaliation,‚Äù the tribunal said, adding that he was not ‚Äútruly remorseful‚Äù.> besides the suspension, dr azman will be censured and must give a written undertaking to the smc that he will not engage in similar conduct in the future. he will also pay the costs and expenses of and incidental to the proceedings.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) |

i studied in london and this happens a lot. i've learnt to just say that i only carry credit card (not cash) so they leave me alone.it works if they genuinely need cash and will look for the next person to ask. otherwise it becomes fishy if they push you to even use your credit card.,Neutral
"usually those who asked me are the elderly. before cb, i have given them several times till i realised that it is all a scam (saw them at singapore pools after that lol). sometimes they ask money for food, so my dad offered to buy food for them. my dad gave an uncle the cai png he dabao for himself once but the uncle still insisted on asking for cash. saw the uncle throwing the cai png away in the end so :/",Positive

"are dtl stations as crowded as the nsl stations? there are nsl stations that routinely have to shut off entry to prevent excessive crowding and gridlock at the platform. there are times where people have to wait for 2-3 trains to board. my record was waiting for 6 trains to board (outside of breakdown)! if dtl is simply merely just crowded must stand and cramp a bit in cabin, that is hardly a complaint, come on. bukit panjang being the first station should make it reasonably easy to board. squeeze a bit la, what is that compared to nsl‚Äôs face-on-door kind of sardine.worse still, northern towns on nsl has no quick trunk bus routes to town taking advantage of expressways, like bp/cck with 190. at least people in bp still have *some* choices to avoid packing like sardine on mrt.anyway, a 6 car nsl train is equivalent to ~12 double deckers. a 3 car dtl train is therefore equivalent to ~6 double deckers. given peak frequency of even let‚Äôs say conservatively at 3 mins intervals, you need those removed/cut bus services (700 and 171) to supply a lot more passengers to be impactful on dtl crowding! service 171 has a peak frequency of 10 mins, service 700 has a peak frequency of 4 mins. 171 has dd, 700 does not (all single deckers according to some online deployment reference). removing those two bus lines theoretically would not cause massive overcrowding on the scale of some nsl stations, provided the dtl stations were not massively overcrowded in the first place.",Positive

"> # no bus, train fare hikes from end-2020 until next review in 2021 due to covid-19: public transport council> singapore ‚Äî in a bid to mitigate the economic impact of covid-19 on singaporeans, bus and train fares will remain unchanged from end-2020, with fare adjustments rolled over till the next review exercise in 2021.> the maximum allowable fare adjustment quantum for this year‚Äôs fare review exercise (fre) - amounting to 4.4 per cent - will be implemented at the next fre in 2021, said the public transport council (ptc) at a virtual media briefing on friday (4 september). concession fares and schemes will also remain unchanged.> sbs transit and smrt trains had applied for the 4.4 per cent quantum in the second half of august. sbs transit cited losses in its rail operations and significant cost pressures in areas such as manpower and repairs and maintenance. operating cost has also further increased due to safety measures to deal with the pandemic. in its latest financial year, sbs transit‚Äôs train segment reported a loss in tens of millions of dollars.> meanwhile, smrt cited escalating costs to operate an expanding train network with increasing operations and maintenance demands. smrt trains also incurred additional costs to ensure a safe transit environment for commuters, in light of the pandemic. for its latest financial year ended march 2020, smrt trains recorded a net loss of around $20 million after tax.> citing the ‚Äúexceptional economic circumstances‚Äù brought on by the pandemic, ptc chair richard magnus said the decision not to raise fares is aimed at helping to ease the financial burden on commuters. ‚Äúour priority will be to safeguard commuters‚Äô interests, while ensuring a financially sustainable public transport system that continues to meet the needs of singaporeans in the years to come.‚Äù> ptc said that it will continue to monitor the macroeconomic indices and prevailing economic conditions closely. in making its decision for the fre in 2021, the council will also continue to balance fare affordability and financial sustainability.> the move is a sharp contrast to the 2019 fre, when the ptc approved one of the largest public transport fare increases in recent years, with card fares for adults travelling on buses and trains increasing by up to nine cents.> asked by yahoo news singapore if the ptc had considered fare reductions or increasing concessionary schemes, magnus acknowledged that the former had been considered but eventually decided against, due to a number of factors.> the ptc chair noted that there is already a ‚Äúwide gap‚Äù between fare revenue and operating costs, with the former insufficient in meeting the cost of the latter.> assistance is also being extended to low-income families to mitigate transport costs, with the application deadline for the 2019 public transport voucher (ptv) exercise extended from 31 october 2020 to 31 january 2021, to give eligible households more time to apply for the vouchers. around 30,000 low-income households will also progressively receive ptvs directly.> magnus also cited ‚Äúwider-based support‚Äù that is already being given by the government through various budget measures, such as the $600 payout given to every singaporean in march.> ptc noted that the ‚Äúsharp and sustained drop‚Äù in ridership due to the pandemic significantly affects the network capacity factor (ncf) component in the fare adjustment formula. alongside the ncf, the formula is based on the core consumer price index, wage index, energy index and a productivity extraction factor of 0.1 per cent.> the ncf, which was introduced in 2018, is not designed to address sharp fluctuations in ridership caused by exceptional circumstances, said magnus.> ptc will therefore conduct a mid-term review on how ncf ought to be applied, or whether it should be partially or totally excluded, when considering its effect on next year‚Äôs fare adjustment. the review will be completed before the next fre in 2021.> in addition, the rail network has been expanding steadily, alongside the rapid advance in productivity-enhancing technology. at the same time, the government is providing significant operational subsidies to sustain the public transport network.> ‚Äúthis mid-term review is therefore timely to ensure that fare adjustment formula remains relevant and responsive,‚Äù said ptc.> ptc noted that the pandemic has significantly affected public transport operators, with whole-day ridership falling by around 75 per cent during the partial lockdown from april to june. nevertheless, trains and buses have continued to run largely at pre-pandemic frequencies.> ridership has been slowly creeping up since - average weekday ridership is now at 60 per cent of pre-covid levels. bus and train frequencies are expected to remain at current levels. public transport operators have also stepped up cleaning regimes, which come at a significant cost amidst the sharp drop in fare revenue.> prior to covid-19, authorities were expected to spend close to $1 billion to renew and upgrade rail operating assets, and another $1 billion to subsidise public bus services annually over the next five years. this translates to more than $1 in subsidies for every journey taken.> ‚Äúwith the impact of covid-19, revenues have fallen further, and we expect government subsidies to be even higher this year,‚Äù said the ptc.> when asked if the government would be absorbing the 4.4 per cent quantum increase, magnus said, ‚Äúwill the operators be able to run the operations at their costs? i think there's already discussion between the government and the public transport operators with regard to this particular area...the principle really is that there should be optimisation of the public transport system, bearing in mind the demand and the supply and the situation, at that point of time.‚Äù> stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t.me/yahoosingapore> related stories:> essential business, official travel between singapore and south korea now allowed> adult card fares to increase by up to 9 cents: public transport council> bus, train card fares for adults to increase by 6 cents: public transport council---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Neutral

"a bus otaku here, tangled with that community and i quit a year ago. its pretty toxic as there is the segregation between those who fanboy over the buses and those who are serious and spend money and time over this hobby. i have seen bus otakus who go to the bus scrapyard frequently to salvage parts from scrapped buses (eg. the electronic display, the seats, the license plate and the most extreme, the oldie ticket machine.) these things aren't cheap (ive bought things there before, and the ticket machine is over $300, a seat is $50, the license plate ranges from $50 to $300) and ive seen otakus with multiple license plates and the electronic displays. i guess this is what drives them in this hobby. its pretty fun to play with the electronic displays and its completely reprogrammable and you can program whatever u want into it. the community is divided into 2 main groups: the ones who commit a lot of time on this hobby and those who just come in for fun. i belong in the latter and used to operate an instagram page @heh.sbs2790r.bus (its a dead page, dont bother following) and the reason i quit is because i was being critcised for my lack of variety of bus pictures. it became such an issue to the point where i just decided to quit and not interact with these people anymore. i do have some friends who i made in this hobby i still keep in contact with but i don't keep in contact with the majority. well, hope this answers your question and if you have any more, just ask away and i will try my best to answer.",Positive

"i agree with the registration plate thing and most bus enthusiasts have a bus service which they ""represent"" and or a particular bus that they ""represent"". therefore some petty people will make a fuss over if people try to ""claim"" it as their own. the politics in the bus community is insane and thats the reason why i quit (check out the comment above). most bus enthusiasts aren't the kind which you stated here, but there is a small group who always cause trouble and are infamous within the community for doing things that are borderline illegal (eg. asking the bus captains for their bus schedules so that they can catch their bus, or to the point where they rig 'cameos', where they ask the bus depot starter to allocate a certain bus to go on that particular service so that they can catch the bus and make a spectacle over it. sometimes cameos happen because the original bus breaks down and they have to pull another bus to cover, but in this case is where they purposely create a cameo which is against lta's policies.) if you have any more questions, you can ask and i will try to answer.",Positive

"thats interesting, thanks for sharing about the community. i actually check out land transport guru every now and then, they're a great ""wiki"" for transport information. it's quite funny to look at people arguing in ltg comment sections. i actually always pictured bus otakus as normal people like car enthusiasts, it was quite a shock to see how crazy some of them could get. recently i saw on ltg that they were removing one of the old double decks from service and i saw many otakus scolding lta for the decision... i just don't see why lta should be blamed for upgrading old buses like they always have been doing.how do they create these ""cameos""? do they sabotage the bus somehow so that it has to stop mid route?",Positive
maybe its just the fact that these people like the bus service so much that they decide to be an expert on it. i personally used to 'rep' routes but i stopped. the oldie buses have the retro feel to it and the seats are sooo comfortable lol. i used to take them all day just to admire the sights along the route and also to relax. i also like to converse with bus captains and learn more about the trade and what they like about being a bus captain. the experiences that i made were the biggest takeaways from this hobby,Positive
"they make friends with people in the bus depots and they ask them so assign this bus to this route. for example, im not gonna dox, but back then there was this new bus called the volvo b8l that was under the seletar depot and was permanently running service 71. it was a part of a trial like the 3 door buses. however, some bus enthus, especially those who have more connections, somehow managed to get the bus off its permanent service and make it run on service 807 (also under seletar depot) which caused a huge uproar, with bus enthus chasing after it like it was a once in a lifetime thing. there are many more examples but this was the most recent one la",Positive

"doesn't seem like something to be scolded over tbh. after all, if you stand near the entrance(the narrow corridor) you'll block the ppl coming in, if you stand at the back where the seats are you'l block those coming out, and you may not be able to stand in the middle(got people, normally there can be two rows, one leaning on the railing the other holding the hanging handles.i often do it, don't think i've gotten scolded for that at all, moderately full or not. if the people who are scolding you were the ones who were seating down, don't bother listening to them unless they have a point. they're not the ones who need to find a place to stand after all.normally there should only be one person near the exit, if got two that means the bus is almost at full capacity. if you're the only one and there's nowhere left to stand it's fine, try to position yourself as innerwards as possible. if got space then maybe just hold the handlebar and not go inside i think.tldr no problem in my eyes, as long as you make space for others to tap their card and stuff, and as long as there's not another person there with you. i know not getting scolded =/= is automatically ok, but for this one it's like scolding people who stand in the middle of the mrt train without moving in.ofc if got other place to stand like the railing(the big space for wheelchair) then stand there better, but if ""moderately full"" then maybe no space then can.not your fault, especially if you move away when ppl wanna exit. some ppl just like to scold.",Positive

i don't get why people like to stand near the door when they are not alighting - bus moderately full. it's better to move in towards the back so you can free the middle area for people to move in and for ppl to board. i understand that some buses are badly designed at the back area just to cater to the wheelchair person\prams but still more reasonable than blocking the exits.,Positive
"i often see people standing at the exit door blocking the way towards the end of the bus.   as more and more passengers enter at the front, the space between the two doors gets filled, but no one passes on towards the end of the bus.   that is annoying imo, especially when more people try to enter, but no one moves on (because people rather stare at their smartphones than looking up to understand they are the reason for the delay).",Positive
"we need more [3 door buses](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/three-door-double-deck-buses-lta-january-13937108), and if ppl curse u for blocking u can always curse them back and tell them use their logic if the bus is alr so crowded where else can u stand",Positive

"those protruding black sensors are part of a safety system called a driver warning system (or collision avoidance system). there are different variants currently in use here. in its most basic form (the camera in front), it can alert the driver when he's getting to close to the car in front, can detect pedestrians in front, and can even read the speed limit signs and register it. many new buses are fitted with more advanced ones (with those protruding sensors). those can detect obstacles, cars, pedestrians, bicycles (this especially important) that are within the the bus's blind spot -- a bus is a very big vehicle, and those mirrors alone can't cover all angles, so there are certain spots on both sides of the bus that can't be spotted from the mirrors. iirc some are also fitted with warning lights, so that if the bus is turning left, it will flash warning lights on left side and sound warning so that any cyclists or motorcyclists on the left of the bus can stay away. again, there's blindspot, so there is always a risk of cyclists/motorcyclists being squashed by a left-turning bus. i heard that there's also a new sensor system that has a camera pointed at the driver's eyes and can warn him if the system suspects that he is dozing off.",Positive

"you ask why should people wait right? i'm saying if people who are not in a rush to go home then they should wait. old people who are not working dont need to rush and can afford to wait non peak hours. this is despite the fact that by right ppl shd give up seats for them, but it's not enforced. go home earlier also doesn't mean suddenly their day will be better. you are the clown here.",Positive
"i don't get the bit on the passenger being responsible for the best routes. aren't they more familiar with the routes themselves? a few times i got confused because google was freaking out, and the bus drivers managed to bail me out on which bus to take.

"> doesn't mean that people should only say sorry if they fk up. it's about empathy, what if that old woman is someone's grandma? they will be very upset at the driver too.i already addressed that by saying:> from a service point of view, yes, he could probably have managed the situation a lot better, and maybe it was because he wasn't alert and didn't see the light turning red, or something else that was his fault.i mean, you were there, so you probably know better than any of us, right? and if so, you did the right thing by lodging a complaint.",Positive
that's not even the same thing. a taxi driver is only responsible for a few passengers. and there is seatbelt in a car. the cab is more equipped to survive an accident. a bus can have more than 50 passengers. and people can only hold onto the handrail but it's not gonna help them much in an accident,Positive
">nobody had him at gunpoint.nobody had you at gunpoint. the idea that someone who's already underpaid and overwork should also have to pander to the feelings of the riders is so unreasonable.>that's not very professional of them.if you want 'professional' bus drivers who provide *additional* service, then i hope you're willing to pay for it.>i disagree a driver's only or most important job is to drive. safety comes first.do you have anything to substantiate your claim that the bus driver wasn't driving safely?",Positive
"well then you should go and join politics and create change. the bus driver does not owe you an explanation.what you‚Äôre doing is pushing your expectations on others.well guess what? why should people live by your expectations and your standards? who are you to set the moral high ground?it‚Äôs not that we are not considerate. but you live in your own world where your standards are something everyone else has to adhere to is what pisses me of. this is the sense of entitlement i was talking about.again, no one is saying the driver is 100% right but for you to use words like traumatized and turns out you‚Äôre just mad at the driver for not being apologetic. did you ever consider how people who are truly traumatized feel when you throw around the words and don‚Äôt mean it? whatever happened to caring about fellow singaporean‚Äôs welfare?  are sexual abuse victims  not singaporean?using words like traumatized loosely, how do you justify that? you cherry pick what is nice for you to reply. and also, training is a form of education‚Ä¶ also, which company would want to incur the cost for training their bus drivers to have better service?",Positive
"that will depend on the guy they‚Äôre hiring. if he can speak mandarin but doesn‚Äôt possess the credentials to work in whatever industry that requires mandarin speakers, then he won‚Äôt be hired. a bus driver usually does not need to converse with passengers that much. even if there was a need to, singapore being a chinese-majority country with a large percentage of citizens also able to speak mandarin would be likely why public transport operators also hire chinese nationals.",Positive
"basic human courtesy to feel bad if he caused many people to fall down. if the drivers are underpaid, they can do many things like complain to the union or go on strikes or be a food delivery man. not take it out on innocent customers. public transport has to be kept affordable for the masses. it's not as if those who can afford more doesn't want to pay more.",Positive
"how is complaining about falling on a bus undermining sexual abuse victims? these are two different things. anyone can be traumatised by different things. stop picking on wordplay, when actions speak louder than words. driver make many people fall down is already in the wrong.change shouldn't only happen from top down. singapore is not a dictator ok. in japan everyone is polite without the govt having to make any laws about politeness. if singapore is such a refined city, that we would be proud to call ourselves singaporeans then we should emulate the better cultures and not just think it's none of our business. smrt is not stupid. i'm sure they can calculate the cost of a lawsuit (which has been reported in the news many times) is higher than just making some roleplay scenarios for the drivers during orientation or training every year. driving a bus is a skilled job leh, not driving a tricycle. so your argument that doing some slides is too ""costly"" is invalid. even rich people also will have future descendants that could lose their wealth and take the bus eventually. so it's for the betterment of everyone that i'm posting this.",Positive

"ooh, today i learned! thanks for that piece of knowledge!that still doesn't exactly answer the question though. what if the bus driver only spoke malay/ tamil, and none of the officers spoke that language?",Positive
"seems self-evident: bus was safe to drive to the depot, but had a fault that meant it couldn't complete the route with passengers.(e.g. case 2 sounds like some sort of sensor fault that meant the door can only be closed by overriding the sensor - not something you'd want to do with passengers onboard)",Positive
"they probably turned off the safety mechanism, that's why it could still move. but not safe for passengers.bus companies really need to send staff for english classes as part of training. i've had bus breakdowns before and both times the drivers spoke in chinese. i had to ask other passengers to understand what was happening.",Negative
"if the driver just kept trying to troubleshoot, rectify the problem, without informing the passangers, and if this went for a a while, he would be blamed for not informing passengers, wasting their time. they were lucky that they managed to solve problem. or, are you thinking that, the drivers ""pretented"" that there was a problem that he could not solve, and waited till all passengers alighted, and he magically ""solved"" it?",Positive
is cos you bring the suay la,Neutral
"to answer why the bus can move off smoothly after a fault. it might be a drop in pressure valve that is used to operate the doors and the bus engine. if there is leak in pressure, there is insufficient pressure to operate both functions ( door and engine ) . if the bus can move, they will return to depot to fix the pressure leak as there is not enough pressure to operate the doors . hope it answers your question.",Neutral
had a bus breakdown in the past too and the prc driver didn't inform as well. they opened up the back of the bus and a lot of fluid was leaking. call me paranoid but idk if the bus would have exploded.looks like they need to add something to their sop about letting customers know when to get off.,Negative
"if they can drive off without a need a of a tow truck , they will alight the passengers , give them ticket for the next bus ride to be free & move off.           it really just you suay & reading too much into it, normally got any issue the bus driver will call to hq via the bus intercom for advisement",Positive

yeah i'll. but the thing is how cool isn't it. like no buses stopping by. makes it perfect to be spooky,Positive
i second this point for sure. with how packed public transport still is the measures like queueing one metre apart seem very unhelpful.,Positive
"tbh, grab and taxis are already really cheap now relative to pre-covid 19, even at peak hours. while i agree a form of subsidy is needed, it should be limited to essential front-line medical staff with prove of employment before being entitled to subsidies. one way of doing this is for medical staff to claim daily cab/grab expenses to their hospital/clinics, and the government give out rebates.if the subsidy is given to everyone, then there will be a lack of supply during peak timings when front line medical staff who needs to get to work, can't get transportation. outside of essential medical staff, subsidies given out should come from the private organizations themselves in goodwill.",Neutral
maybe the govt could consider giving all frontline medical/security workers some form of daily transport voucher that allow them to get free rides on taxis1. you somewhat social distance the medical staff from public transport and also free up congestion on trains/buses.2. you help the taxi industry who is currently under utilized.3. a good show of appreciation to the people who are saving lifes daily.,Positive
"use economic incentive to try to divert the huge amount of people going for work. for example, lower the fare for taking mrt before and after the usual peak hour could work. this could try to change people's behaviour using economic incentive and divert as much people away from peak hour as possible.",Positive

"yeah, the measures need to be consistent across all aspects of life. you can't have one rule at work and in eateries, then ignore it entirely on public transport. we aren't giving the 1m spacing rule a fair assessment because 20% of the time we don't adhere to it.",Positive

"a lot of people cannot work from home:medical/hospital staff, police, civil defense, groceries, transport, manufacturing, construction, f+b. we aren't an island of bankers and traders.it would be nice if we could all work from home. but for those of us who can't: we should make it as safe as possible, to get to work, at work and to get home.",Positive
not everybody works in an office setting. most of us work in the service/hospitality and literally the frontliners.,Positive
maybe the solution is your name,Neutral
"this is the wrong way of thinking. you cannot discount the 95% of time adhering to social distancing just because 5% of the time you cant because you're on public transport. you are still lowering transmission in that 95% and that 95% matters alot more than you think.   its not ""all-for-nothing"". its not like you social distance for 23 hours and 1 hour you dont means you die already. that 23 hours matters because you are not spreading the disease in that 23 hours and your chance of contracting is minimised cumulatively.",Positive
"yeah. but not when it's up to 20% of the time for most people spend outside of home. workday is 9 hours including lunch hour, commuting is let's say 1 hour each way. i had work situations where commuting took up 30% of my time outside of home. it's generally way longer than the 30-40minutes you spend eating lunch outside. if we are going to tackle something now, it should be the commute, or the social distancing measures we implement for the relatively shorter lunch times will be lost in the noise.",Positive
"i'm also not discounting the work place measures, these are by far the largest and therefore most important chunk of time we spend outside of home now. unfortunately for the majority of singaporeans, the second largest chunk of time after time at work is time on commute, so we definitely need some measures for this, or it is pointless trying to regulate smaller chunks of time, like lunch hour.",Positive
"do people who write stuff like this think they are dropping some radical wisdom or something? no, you are not the only one who sees the problem. it's a compromise because the cost of severely restricting public transport occupancy in singapore would be unacceptably high. so we compromise by trying to reduce occupancy indirectly (wfh, reduced activities etc) and minimizing risk during transit (masks, try not to talk etc). i think the vast majority of reasonable people can understand this. if this article was meant for anything other than parroting a tired complaint that has been repeated for the past *year*, maybe they could have tried including something that resembles a proposed solution.",Negative

"hey look at that: **masks actually works to minimize the spread of covid!!**of course it doesn‚Äôt eliminate it but in an environment where most are not talking and/or eating, transmission rates are much lower. compare that to a hawker center or ktv where you take off or pull down your mask to consume and/or talk (sometimes loudly).",Positive
