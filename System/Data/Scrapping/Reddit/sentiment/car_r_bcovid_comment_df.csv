"if you can't beat them, buy them out?",Neutral
"comfort merely acquired part of the rental car business, which uber had to set up specifically for uber drivers to overcome the high prices here. thats a definite win for uber imho, they get a boatload of cash and they amazingly found someone to actually take partial ownership of their rental fleet and bear part of the risk of low demand and obselecence. arguably the most troublesome part of their ops in singapore.if this wasnt enough all the uber drivers renting the car from there still use the uber app, plus comfort is still nice enough to drive even more traffic to them in the form of cab drivers. what a deal.controlling the rental car business with 51% isnt even leverage, its just cars- uber can set it up all over again should it need to without comfort, and their users will have to jump over. in fact that leaves comfort with a shit load of empty vehicles which it then has to offload or idle (sounds familar?), which means uber has more command over the fleet in reality.",Positive

"fyi, comfortdelgro's taxi business only accounts for 30% of it's revenue. it also owns vicom and other maintenance facilities. did i mention they also own sbs transit? the comfort-uber partnership talks have been going on since january. grab has already partnered with the rest of the other taxi companies and this will help level the playing field. hope you are enlightened and don't jump too quickly to conclusions:)",Positive
"pretty sure there are clauses in the agreement that would prevent them from doing that, otherwise the lawyers at comfort should get fired. this is comfort buying into uber so their fleet doesn't get obsolete from the huge demand in door-to-door chauffeur services that people expect now. why wait and flag for a cab when you can just grab/uber?",Positive

"thats true, but ill be surprised if that were the case. if there were clauses that uber has to use/ promote lion city rentals solely, it would mean that comfort has effective control over all prices charged to car renters, and can raise it at will, hurting uber. this also creates a conflict of interest since they also rent out taxis. unless of course, the agreement suggests that uber has price control for it to make adjustments to compete with grab, in which case having 51% of a rental car business is pretty useless.",Positive
ownself,Neutral
"it's win win for comfort and uber, lose lose for consumers and drivers. basically they agree to stop competing. comfort takes over the vehicles and assets, uber will send its drivers to rent from comfort, so taxi and car rentals will go up since less competition from each other. on the consumer end, same thing, instead of engaging in price war, they can put their heads together and happily increase fares.",Positive

"singapore - two local motor companies have bought uber-owned lion city rentals, marking the united states ride-hailing firm's complete exit from singapore.waydrive holdings, a new joint venture between vehicle trader motorway group and workshop operator toh motor, signed on the dotted line on friday evening (jan 4) to acquire 100 per cent of lion city rentals (lcr) for an undisclosed sum.the straits times understands the transaction involves some 8,000 cars that are two years old and above, and an acquisition price of around $350 million.when contacted, motorway chief executive michael lim said the deal will include the takeover of about 150 lion city rentals employees, as well as its rented premises.asked why he was buying over the company when the market is deemed over-supplied with cars, mr lim said: ""eighty per cent of lcr cars are rented out.""we are also in talks with grab and gojek to supply them cars. we will have a fuller picture in two to three weeks' time.""mr lim said the acquisition has been four to five months in the making, and that there were at least two other motor dealers who were in talks to buy over lcr.the deal comes eight months after uber and comfortdelgro called off an agreement for the local taxi giant to purchase a 51 per cent stake in lion city rentals for $642 million.comfortdelgro’s purchase agreement was inked in december 2017. three months later in march 2018, uber announced its exit from the south-east asian market.uber did not respond to press queries on saturday, but a spokesman said last september that ""lion city rentals continues to partner with thousands of drivers and hirers every day in singapore and remains committed to the market"".in an e-mail sent to employees on friday, uber chief international business officer brooks entwistle described the deal as ""good news for uber and waydrive... and great news for lion city rentals employees and customers"".he said lion city rentals ""business fundamentals are solid"".in another e-mail to driver-hirers, lion city rentals said the transaction ""will not result in any changes to your experience"", and that there would be no change to their contracts.although some industry players expect motorway's mr lim - known for his business acumen - to turn the loss-incurring lion city rentals business around, others are surprised by the deal.one said: ""drivers today prefer fuel-efficient hybrid cars. most of their (lion city rentals) cars are not hybrids.""and in this business, a two-year-old car is considered old. each week, these cars can clock up to 10,000km, as the drivers drive for 10 hours a day or more to survive.""",Positive

"i'll talk a bit about transport. assuming you're taking the train to and from work each day, that'll cost you on average $2 a trip and $4 a day? 20 working days makes that $80. add a lot of miscellaneous transport expenses and you should be able to keep it to less than $150 a month per person on transport without too much hassle.buy your goods at ntuc, sheng shiong or the wet market. the $10 melon is from medi-ya which is more of a specialised store downtown that mainly sells japanese goods. i won't be surprised if you find $100 grapes, but don't use that for comparison. if you really want to find the absolute best deal, try this site https://www.diffmarts.com/. it gives price comparisons for the major supermarkets in singapore (including redmart). ntuc always has random sales for random fruits depending on season. there's a $1.90 for 250g blueberries sale going in at least three ntucs i visited in the past week. cold storage is another chain that we all know as slightly more upmarket in terms of price and products. if you live near a town centre (e.g. woodlands, tampines, jurong) you can probably get more than one supermarket to choose from.you can also get great food from hawker centres. there's at least one near you in every town. you can get a good variety of food for a very good price (think less than $5 a meal). which is to say you don't have to force yourself to cook every day if your schedule doesn't permit, there's affordable food all around.a mid-tier restaurant would set you back about $15-20 per person. movies on the weekends cost about $14 depending on theater.",Positive

i think its more than enough so long as you dont splurge unnecessarily. my dad's earning less than 2k and we scrape through fine.. struggling here and there a little but am thankful for what we have. buy your necessities like shampoo from provision shops instead of watsons/ntuc cause there is a real vast price difference. or if you do drive/dont mind the distance.. my dad buys groceries like fruits/honey from malaysia.for transport maybe you can try purchasing concession?,Positive
"mid-level restaurants in singapore would probably set you back by about $80-100, depending on drinks and how fancy it is. fresh fruits and vegetables at supermarkets (ntuc, which is probably going to be most accessible and widely-found) for 2 will not be that expensive. i'd say $100 on groceries for 2 is more than sufficient. apples, bananas, watermelons are some of the most common fruits available. vegetables you're used to in the us - kale, spinach, broccoli etc - will be more expensive as compared to in singapore, but it's got to do with the agriculture subsidies in the states. cabbage and chinese spinach will not set you back by much. in essence, $2000 for 2 people is definitely enough to cover groceries and living expenses, assuming your electricity/gas/utilities consumption is not excessive (probably about $150-200 for 2 people in a condo). transport should be about $100-120 per person, if you're taking public transport.

"get from the rental company locally, usually they offer the option. hassle free as well, just call their 24 hour hotline, they come down to pick up the car and send you a new car and you carry on with your holiday and settle one bill when you return the car. no need for claims when you come back.",Positive

"if you are talking about excess, either you paid to the local insurance company or the rental company. in your case, just go for rental company because you save the hazzle of forking out with a sum upfront to claim from local insurance company. the paperwork is not worth it. in short, insurance company is not in question.",Negative
