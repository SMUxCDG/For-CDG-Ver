comment,sentiment
the leg space at the backseat of those toyota crown is something that i miss. hmm,Neutral
iirc those were manual too. always loved seeing the driver change gear as a kid.,Positive
anyone remember the vibrations? i remember some were so intense that i couldn’t take a nap. i recall being able to do robot voices if i leaned my head on the windows too haha. man that’s nostalgia right there.,Positive
were they driving at memory lane?,Neutral
back when starting cab fee was $2.80 or $3. now it's $3.70 or $3.90 on newer cabs. sad sia,Negative
i miss the smell of them most,Positive
"just a fun fact for you guys, the taxi at the back (hyundai sonata) is now in the retiring process",Positive
does anyone remember that awesome bell sound for when they exceeded the speed limit? tried to find one for my car but never found any promising leads t_t,Positive
old crown cabs built this city,Positive
i preferred the nissan cedrics. always got excited when i got to ride one of them as a kid.,Positive
"crowns and cedrics had ample legroom in the rear. it's a shame they don't ply the roads here anymore, but you'll still find many crowns in japan... if you're willing to pay the exorbitant cab costs (and an air ticket, of course) to begin with!",Positive
"no thx. i hate the taxi service in singapore. no one remembers long queues at taxi stands, and taxi uncles picking and choosing their customers? also horror stories about taxi drivers scolding customers for only going such a short distance, or forcing people to get off on the expressway because they are argumentative? or what about deliberately driving a longer route to get more cash for their time?when uber came about, i was geniunely glad to see our taxi drivers squirm and complain because they would no longer be able to game a shitty cab system that preys on its customers. uber tried its best to balance the needs of its drivers and customers, while enforcing a fair system that people couldnt exploit much. cabbies werent allowed to ""choose"" customers, being assigned the nearest customer for pickup to anywhere in singapore. uber ride sharing was a fantastic piece of technology that saved plenty of petrol. it was a good time.then grab came along, copied some aspects of uber, edged them out, and started paying its drivers less and less. they also had a system which allowed drivers to select their customers and see the route (basically going back to pick n choose, leaving unpopular route passengers waiting forever - totally not passenger centric)then grab's ceo said he wouldnt compete with other ride hailing services, and now i feel that gojek is the next big thing because its almost always cheaper compared to grab.i did not like it when cabs complained about losing their livelihoods to ride hailing services, and then those services got slapped with lotsa regulations by the government. the taxi service in sg has not evolved in the last few decades because of greed, they shouldnt have gotten a hand up.",Negative
i miss the engine sound. sounds powerful when compared to the hyundais.,Positive
"is it just me or i can't stand the smell of taxis, i always get dizzy and wants to vomit after riding taxis.can anyone legit tell me.",Positive
"even the hyundai model (the one at the back) is off the road, yea?",Neutral
cheaper rentals for the cabbies as well,Neutral
also the drivers always have the back support(idk what is it called).,Neutral
i remember sitting in these when i was young... back when they had those walkie talkie radio things (is that what they’re called?!),Positive
i reckon the previous gen toyota crown from this pic is more spacious.,Positive
i can smell this picture,Neutral
"i for one do not miss the old taxis. i used to hate the air freshener smell they had, made me feel nauseous. the newer taxis nowadays don't seem to have that anymore, or maybe air fresheners have improved over the years.",Negative
i liked the springy seats,Positive
guacamole nibba p**** for free,Positive
"eh, what do they look like now? i was in sg between 2013-14 so this is all i know!",Neutral
"just by looking at the picture, it has already given me headaches..",Neutral
nostalgic af,Neutral
i always found myself falling asleep on taxi rides on the crown. the engine drone is the perfect white noise.,Positive
i can smell this picture,Neutral
90s taxi model,Neutral
"leg room was huge but when speed is high, it feels floaty and scary sometimes.",Positive
as a kid i always felt like i was bouncing on jelly when in this cab. and i wondered for the longest time what the little 'ting' sounds were (realised it was a speed warning thing much much later).,Positive
"what i miss most in the sheer space of the leg room, the boot space .those were the days",Positive
the old taxis smelled weird,Positive
i miss the nissan cedrics,Neutral
anybody knows where to find like figurines for these? i can only find the newer ones for the hyundai's one now...,Neutral
crown!!!!!!,Neutral
"the old crown taxi, one of the cheap and luxurious cars but now it is no more, because by the time the stopped using the crown it was 20+ years old",Positive
wow brings back memories,Positive
nostalgia sia:( sadded,Neutral
"damn. those bench seats. i recall one time being flung all around while a cab driver was driving like a psycho. also, these guys were most often the ones to pick you up no matter what at 3am - the rest pick n choose.",Positive
"they are still driving these in japan, their door mirrors are on top of the front side panels above the wheels - very old school. very roomy at the back, we sat three at the back comfortably and the seat covers were pristine white.",Positive
i thought the toyota crowns were designed as taxis in the first place.,Positive
i remember damn near every driver would have the bead massager on the seat. wonder if those actually worked.,Positive
i can smell this photo,Neutral
why are comments here getting downvoted ?? noticed this toxic trend in r/singapore threads,Neutral
maybe i just miss the old taxi price $2.90 flat fare,Negative
don't miss them.,Neutral
and that “taxi” smell,Neutral
"so much more comfortable! they had leg room, you could get in and out without feeling like you need to do yoga.",Positive
"lol, yup same here, tall guy problem",Positive
"i heard those toyota crowns are near indestructible. in a car accident, the crowns get only light scratches on the body while other cars will need to be towed away for repairs.",Positive
the manual stick is today's anti car theft device,Neutral
i took a ride once and i thought it was an automatic; the driver was damn good at shifting seamlessly.,Positive
"i feel ya,i like when they change gear,so nostalgic.ah the good old days",Positive
i loved to see the gear stick shake to all hell every time the taxi stopped at a light.,Positive
most of the cab drivers sucked at it,Positive
you could do that on the old buses where the windows could open too.,Positive
felt it more on the nissan cedric taxis used by smrt/smartedit: wrong model,Positive
"i just lie onto the window pane and go ""eeeeeeeee"" as the taxi vibrates",Neutral
those seats use to bounce!,Neutral
i think it was at the boulevard of dreams,Neutral
that's just inflation. not like they suddenly decided they want to fleece customers more.,Positive
$1.80 or $2.10,Neutral
cabs are still super cheap in singapore as compared to other countries tho,Positive
i remember a time when the peak hour surcharge was flat $4.,Negative
the earliest i remember was cab fees being only $2.20 or $2.40 when boarding. and it jumps 20cent,Neutral
new black camrys starts at $5.50 crazy !,Negative
pandan leaves!,Neutral
yucks. that shit made me wanna puke everytime,Negative
this pre-facelift unit \[simpler grille design\] is long gone,Negative
change to i40?,Neutral
only a few left & they would be out in 5-6 months.click your pics now :),Negative
the ae86 chime might work for the same purpose too,Neutral
they were retired earlier than the crowns. what year was it exactly?,Positive
"the cedrics had quieter engines, too.",Neutral
"also got crowns in hk, love riding in them when i'm there!",Positive
"this. everything you said i agree with (will have to see how gojek plays out) but i can't stand the taxis here and much prefer grab. will only take a taxi if it's it right here, right now and i'm in a hurry. all other times for sure grab.for nostalgia's sake, sure the seats and the smell, great. but for customer service, seriously rotten most of the time.",Positive
it just you lmao. i like the old taxi smell,Positive
yeah the pre-facelifted taxi units (simpler grille design) are gone,Neutral
some of these sonatas are still running around,Neutral
oh damn i remember when i thought the hyundais were really new,Positive
"yeah, they closed down the kindergarten too :( - live nearby as well",Negative
beaded seat cover?,Neutral
"i think they used that to comms between drivers of the same guild or club to alert each other of people flagging for taxis and they, for whatever reason, couldn't pick them up.",Negative
"specifically, pandan to keep those cockroaches at bay",Neutral
am i the only one that hates the smell? remember i used to get car sick more easily when im in taxis with the “taxi” smell...,Positive
> toyota crowns are near indestructible.even the engines are indestructible. the newer hyundais just aren't as reliable.,Positive
"really awesome when you get a driver like that, then there's the ones who shift to fifth gear at 40km/h and the engine probably doing 1500 revs only lol, whole taxi shaking like mad haha",Positive
omg hahaha ikrr. the whole taxi would vibrate as well,Positive
i walk a lonely road...,Neutral
"wait, is the inflation rate that low?i remember reading somewhere that it is normal for prices to double every 20 years.",Positive
back when reddit wasn't a thing... oh shit too far back! too far back!!,Positive
yep ik that,Neutral
and toyota priusedit spelling,Neutral
"not sure, am only 18 now so it shouldn't be before 2005 since i have vivid memories of it.",Negative
oh yeah,Neutral
probably! i was once also told they were for the call centre to contact the drivers for calls!,Neutral
oh is that what it is? gosh i love it so much lol,Positive
oh that smell makes me feel like vomiting usually will leave the cab if there's the smell.,Negative
same! it makes me terribly car sick too. i avoid taxis at all cost. i'm known as that fucker who'd take an mrt from jurong to the airport.,Negative
yes me too!,Neutral
"i didn't like it, had to endure it cuz my dad used to drive taxi and i'd get nausea everytime i ride with him.new taxi smells are fine for me i realize.",Positive
one taxi uncle said toyota crowns were less comfortable to drive for sure but the lack of electronics and a rugged chassis and body meant they survive years of professional abuse.,Positive
save fuel lol,Positive
am i the only one who sings while reading these?,Neutral
the only one that i have ever known...,Neutral
"if it is, all the more the original comment is invalid.like the other person said, cabs are fairly cheap compared to other countries. it's also a luxury in a country where public transport is decent.",Positive
that explains your username.,Neutral
"oh yeaaa, damn that smell gives me headaches",Neutral
"difficult manual transmission to use until you spend lots of time to get used to it (as compared to modern manuals, like newer fords - idiot proof cars that even automatically rev match on highway speed downshifts and restart the engine after a stall).had the privilege of being assigned one when i booked a ""small-to-medium sized"" rental car in a developing country. sure as hell wasn't small to medium, my passengers stretched out and slept like babies. had over 400k miles on it but still drove and rode like a dream.",Negative
yes,Neutral
"its a diesel tho, it probably doesnt rev till 4k rpm in the first place. plus i think ur idea is efficiency",Positive
wanna me pass the msg tmr morning i work in the same building as him,Neutral
somehow the image of someone walking down the expressway shoulder is hilarious to me 😂😂,Positive
this is so wholesome :”,Neutral
aww a wholesome post. hope we can find this uncle.,Neutral
"reminds me of a time my friend and i somehow got lost in macritchie and came out of the golfing side. the walk to the main roads was quite long and there were monkeys (some pretty feisty looking) surrounding us as we were making our way out.a random guy, pulled up beside us in his car and asked us why we were walking there. we told him our story and he offered to drive us to the nearest bus stop. top lad.",Positive

he looks pretty damn cool with those shades man,Positive
you can email the company describing this appearance and time when he pick you up. the company will know base on their delivery schedule. such good soul are a rare thing these days. kudos to him!,Positive
"can't the driver ask his fellow driver to hail in? walking in expressway is very dangerous if you happen to walk, luckily not.",Negative
why didn't you or the taxi driver call emas? it's dangerous and illegal to walk on expressways,Negative
my uncle also offered me a ride once....didnt have quite the same result though...,Neutral
humanity saved once again. thanks random uncle hope you help alot of people in need.,Negative
what dystopian psychopathy is going on in here?,Neutral
wholesome. hope you get the job too! :),Neutral
i got picked up by an uncle with a lorry too at the sungei gedong camp bus stop on the last day of ns! i had my pillow and stuff too haha. i was thinking whether i should get in but my brain went “ord loh”,Positive
faith in humanity restored,Neutral
"reminds me when i was dumb boy dunno how use bus, auntie notice my school uni and then ask me what i was doing. turns out, i, being the dumbass, miss my stop and so she gave me money to go take taxi back. so nice. 20/10 if i meey her one day i will try to pay back.",Positive
where is the highway?,Neutral
"becareful about walking on the expressway, you could get fined for that",Neutral
deleted for low wits who can't recognize an obvious joke lol,Positive
"yes please, but i want to do something more so i need some ideas as i'm not sure what i can do.",Positive
thank you for helping to pass the message. all efforts of kindness should be recognised and this uncle is really gracious enough to assist. kudos to the uncle.,Positive
"uncle looks like obama, with the same smirk.",Neutral
"i know i can't really blame the taxi driver though, he kept saying sorry but i just said it's okay, i mean, i can just walk, smoke and clear my mind like taking a walk except that i'm exposing myself to traffic danger. xd",Positive
‘wholesome’ seems like a trendy word nowadays in this sub.,Neutral
"yes, that's why i couldn't offer anything, i didn't have cash on me too. :(",Neutral
"i did, but apparently the website is not singapore-based iirc.",Positive
even if you walk at the side?,Neutral
taxi uncle had to call emas definitely but he kept saying it's gonna take a while sooooo,Neutral
it's okay.... show us on the doll where he touch you...,Positive
did he offer you a ride or offered to ride you?,Neutral
bke :) i live in bukit panjang.,Positive
50/50 chance run you over or pick you up,Neutral
"no worries, mothership will probably pick up on this story soon.",Neutral
ang pao always good alongside a glowing commendation to his company.,Positive
"this kind of person is honestly probably gonna say: don't give me anything, but you go ahead and do a good deed when you can.so if he rejects any gift, be prepared to ask what his fav charity is, i guess?",Positive
make him famous on reddit,Positive
"i would suggest giving foods like cookies etc but i don't think its a good idea since its ramadan and they are fasting now. maybe something that he can use? angbao is of course a very direct and useful gift though. what about to have his iftar(break fast) with him and treat his(or maybe by extension, family) to a meal? it will be really wholesome.",Positive
waiting for updates.,Neutral
"i know, i didn't even ask for help i was just walking and he stopped right infront of me like a standard kidnapping scene. xd",Positive
"it's been super ffking hot lately, how did you even survive the weather??!",Positive
"idk how old you are, but its used all over the internet, not just in this sub.",Positive

he means the word wholesome used in this subreddit. not in general.,Negative
"there are worse things that are trending. but people live in their own tier. we don't think much about malaria, or how our company is doing. that doesn't invalidate or get invalidated by anything else",Positive

"do good, do together",Positive
"self administered surge pricing.please flag to lta, there were taxis touting at clark quay a while back and lta revoke  their licenses.",Neutral
"license plate and other details, send to lta and the cab company",Negative
i've seen the exact opposite before. there was a man at paragon who looked like he was late for something and needed a ride quick. tried to jump the taxi queue by running up to the taxis coming in and offering the drivers 50 bucks to get on first. he was refused multiple times. i thought it was very upstanding of the drivers.,Positive
wow. i thought this goes only @ vivo city.,Positive
"yes pls report them. have met some at clark quay before. a group of them banded together and quoted me a 1.5 times price instead of meter, because they thought i was a tourist. i decided to ignore them and flag another cab further down the road.",Negative
"still report, without license plate. they will go down and monitor and catch those buggers",Negative
"orchard towers too... $30 flat fare to go to clarke quay.  as soon as we heard him said this,  my colleague gave a straight ""fk off la, we singaporeans"" lolol",Positive
these touts wouldn’t have the opportunity if the waiting times at orchard ion & wisma atria were such a joke. taxi drivers picking their rides instead of the other way around are actually making queues longer. the look on the tourists faces is really a facepalm 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♀️ moment. this is a national embarrassment.,Positive
best is to just get in and let them drive you to your destination then get out without paying. they can't do anything because it's illegal in the first place.,Positive
get license plate report to lta,Neutral
"should’ve gone in, snapped a pic of his license then said nah bro u tryna fuk me over",Neutral
isn’t it quite common at vivo city taxi area? flat rate 7 seater.,Negative
this also happened at mbs last year nye after the countdown and everyone was desperate for a taxi. i was wondering if it was sanctioned by mbs.,Negative
for a single trip!? the fuck. mrt would take less than 15 mins.,Negative
"you see this alot in marina bay sands , nothing new. &#x200b;",Positive
you can find them every night at cq.,Neutral
please take down the number plate and report to lta.,Negative
singapore zoo also has such 7 seater taxis. $60 to any destination in sg.,Neutral
"yep, it's illegal. i guess the easiest way is to note down the license plate number and just let lta know. i'd suggest reporting it to the taxi companies themselves but in my experience, it's unlikely they'll take action",Negative
npnt,Neutral
marina cruise centre also has...all those minibuses with the zhng sound systems and leds.,Positive
were these drivers in official taxis or private car hires?,Neutral
couple of years back i was at clarke quay for count down with some friends. 2 drunk ang mohs came out looking for taxis and a black chrysler came out and tried to quote $50/each for a ride to orchard. and the 2 drunk ang mohs just boarded the cab. &#x200b;,Negative
"i find it interesting that it's illegal for a cab but if you make an app, you can charge whatever you want.  ",Positive
"i couldn’t tell from the taxi exterior which company it’s from. it’s a 7 seater though. damn i thought i remembered the car plate but as soon as i woke up the next day, numbers gone.",Neutral
vivo one seems to be a legit service by smrt. but they don't seem to be touting and just have a stand next to the vehicle for interested people to approach them,Positive
"iirc the one at vivo is a limousine service, since it's near a port and all",Positive
you encountered the same at vivo?,Neutral
ya the way coming in is congested af.,Neutral
that's only if they don't secretly start the meter anyway.,Neutral
nope definitely not,Neutral
nobody reported? it’s my first time encountering,Positive
i think it’s official taxi becoz of the thing on their hood that displays “taxi” in green light,Positive
how do you know? i though taxi drivers are all local citizens?,Neutral
"if it isn't emergency don't call that number. you risk delaying emergency cases from being heard. instead, one should contact lta or relevant authorities in this case.",Positive
what does the fact that they are white have to do with your story?  stop perpetuating racism.,Neutral
it's about applying pricing consistently and not on a per individual basis.  with the app everyone is paying the same price if picking up and going to the same locations at the same time.  that's why this isn't a fair comparison.,Positive
"negative. even if the cab uses the grab platform, they must charge according to meter (unless got grab promo lah then that is counted under grab.)for phv, grab is considered the 'meter'.",Negative
"the difference is the potential for discrimination. a grab driver cannot charge you more just because you look ignorant (e.g. foreigner not knowing how things work) or gullible (e.g. person with lower iq, blur teenagers). or if they think you high ses. also: unrelated to the legality issue, but having to check every cab for the best price is damn leceh pls. grab just has one price at any one time. i think cannot equate the two la.",Positive
"i think it's because in the case of grab, it's easier to hold them liable than a person",Neutral
like that how to win 4d,Positive
should’ve clicked a pic la,Neutral
you could have at least noted the numbers down in your phone if you didn't snap a picture.,Negative
yes. aware of the smrt desk but did encounter grab / uber kinda service. i.e. person approaching families with young kids or >4 group.,Positive
"not sure what you would call this, but they were definitely coming over to the taxi stand queue touting their services. even shouted “have to wait an hour..”",Negative
the harbourfront center limo counter is legit. operated by smrt taxis.,Negative
"the one at vivocity is legit. there's one at tenah merah ferry terminal too. for those who don't want to queue up at the taxi stand, you can approach the counter and they'll get you a taxi instantly. costs around $50 for a trip to jurong west.",Neutral
that entire road layout gives me a migraine when i have to drive into it. its just such a bad layout,Negative
"wah, like that also racist ah",Neutral
it just shows that these people are targeting foreigners. how is that racist.,Neutral
didn't felt any racism at all. i think he basically meant that they were most likely foreigners who didn't know how things work,Positive
reeee racism reee,Neutral
"hence why you could make an app for this. so when you want more money, increase price similarly to every other cab in the vicinity. capitalism at its finest",Positive
"video, zoom into uncle’s face, take the car, zoom into the licence plate.",Neutral
you can save money by taking mrt and bus. this is not much different from theft.,Negative
openly admitting to committing fraud. weird flex but ok.,Neutral
not understanding our culture well enough i guess.,Neutral
"but if it was more expensive, people would just flag the cab and not order it thru the app in the first place.",Positive
_enhance_,Neutral
that and if people started pricing based on appearance than things start becoming unfair,Negative
"read back my post on top. i'm not talking about profit, i'm talking about legality and it's loophole/regulation.",Positive
zoom in again,Neutral
"you literally stated that you had more money than the $20 you claimed so yes, you are comparatively a worse person than one who doesn’t try to deceive a taxi driver under the pretence of being ""a student with no money"" or having a ""sad face"" just to save a few bucks.. as for the ""you may not have much cash with you"" part, well you did, so case closed i guess.",Negative
"you should have left while the public transport was still running, not take advantage of some uncle's kindness. if you couldn't afford it you should have planned around it. people like you are the reason why other people are so wary about helping others, because they don't want to be taken advantage of.i think the worst part is that you still had the nerve to recommend it to people as a ""saving money tip"". this is like taking tips from tim leissner on earning money on a smaller scale.",Negative
suck thumb and pay what you actually have?,Neutral
"well you could've try *not to go back home so late for whatever social activity* you are having. you knew the risk of joining these events. all these taxi uncles chose to work midnight, and still willing to send you home at loss. did you return anything to him in the end? like getting his name or plate for being so nice to you that you wish to repay him one day? no, right?no matter how poor or bad your financial condition, cheating is cheating.",Positive
"i understand your point,i wanted to take note of his name or license plate back then,but i was already have too much to think at that time.i even apologised to the uncle.well,as of now,i already feel bad to share my experiences,just to receive bad replies.i admit my mistakes & please forgive me for my harsh word.i am just somebody child making end meet back.then.edit: i apologised to all & wish you all have a good  years ahead in 2019.",Negative
"so he explicitly puts a bounty on a member of public, which is illegal, and more subtly puts a bounty on a group of police officers. a lawyer could probably swing it as a threat on a civil servant.and then proceeded to blackmail a police officer by threatening to ""end his career"" very explicitly, and also very kindly typed it out himself for the world to see.man, if i was a lawyer i wouldn't touch this guy. he could very well ""volunteer"" more ammo against himself in another of his rants, and what he has already admitted is damning enough.",Positive
"sounds like complete bullshit. 1) no singaporean taxi driver wouldnt just shut up and drive when they're offered 50x the fare2) 999 will not bother explaining whether grab is a contract or not, their aim is to dispatch someone and get time wasting idiots like him off the phone so someone else who actually needs proper help can get through.3) he would have gotten arrested for swearing at a public servant. 4) if someone was gonna lose 70k for missing a meeting he would have used the 70k to buy a car and not taken a fucking comfort cab booked over grab.",Negative

"he replied on edmw,i posted this earlier and i’ll say it again. i edited parts away that some pointed out made it sound insincere and if you still think i’m talking cock, then well i’m sorry but i’m trying to be as sincere as i can right now. i never fought the uncle. in fact i said multiple times i just wanted to get home. girl was unwell and had gastric so bad she could barely stand, plus it’s a matter of principle. time was lost because the officers insisted i talked it out with them and the driver despite me saying i was pressed for time. i said i had to go urgently and i just wanted to head back, but apparently because the patrol car was involved, it had to be settled before they would let me leave. facebook post was deleted because i thought a full day about it, and maybe it hit me a little slower, but it took till late afternoon/evening did i realise posting something like that was wrong. it was immature especially at my age and i should have known better. it’s not about flipping around 180 degrees and suddenly being apologetic because this “saga” blew up. it’s 5am now and truth be told i’ve been up because i’m trying to find the indian officer so i can lodge an official report against him. i called orchard npc a good 5 times this afternoon, i was made to wait 2 hours while constantly being redirected here and there and it was quite clear they were not going to release his name for me to make a report. police policy or protecting their own? i don’t know. as far as grab’s contractual obligation admittedly i will say i don’t know. i said what i said because the driver was on the phone with grab’s support staff on loudspeaker, and i asked “if i’m already in the car and made the booking and he didn’t cancel before hand, is he obliged to drop me at my destination”. the service staff on the phone replied the driver with “sorry mr koh, but you do have to drive them there”. that’s when the aggression on his end escalated and i had no intention to fight. i’ll say this for the last time - what i posted on facebook was done out of character and not something i would typically do. it’s not a valid excuse and it is something that was clearly wrong of me. so this apology here goes out to everyone and anyone who felt that i went overboard. you can continue thinking i’m full of crap, am a joke or whatever. but on my end, i am officially apologising for letting my emotional bias and state cloud my logic and rationality. i will face the consequences for my actions (on the phone with the npc io i did mention that if he’s not going to give me the officer’s identity, i will pay for it). but all that being said, tl;dr, this is not me flip flopping. this is me realising what i did was out of character, wrong, and not right to do so. i will be deactivating social media just to take some time to reflect on these actions of mine. for the ones who said mean things here on this thread i think you have every right to because what i did was rude, condescending, very overboard and not right at all however much you wanna think it’s a csb or true. but for the ones who spoke kindly after i explained myself, i thank you for the kindness. i’ll freely admit this - my personal life has taken a huge hit this past month and i have not been the most stable person out there. to the one who suggested i need help, i’m not ashamed to share on a public forum i’ve been seeking psychiatric treatment (reason i don’t drive) and counselling. but again, this is no excuse for my behaviour. the driver and officers did me wrong, but i should have handled the situation better. i don’t ask that you accept my apology or for this backlash to stop. i know when i wake up there will be more criticism and i’m prepared for it. but as of right now, i apologise to every soul here who has taken offence to my actions and words. this is me genuinely saying i’m sorry, this is not something i would usually do, i acted out of character, and you guys have taught me that i should not just think twice but in fact ten times before i react out of emotional anger. i will be thinking twice about the lawsuit regarding the driver (on hindsight my second option is overboard as someone pointed out how he was just doing his job and he has a family to feed). but sexual harassment is not right, and i will find a way to contact him, and i will make an effort to try and get him to understand why i was offended by his actions. as far as the police are concerned, the io knows i want to report the officer and what’s i said about paying for his information. the use of the word “bounty” came across too much, and again it was wrong of me. i will be a man and face whatever consequence they throw at me for my actions. i’d like to thank the ones here to reminded me of the illegal bits of what i posted - when you’re blinded by anger it’s easy to say things without thinking. whether you think this is a faux apology i can’t control what you think. but this is the sincerest way i can think of to apologise to the community. i am genuinely sorry for overreacting, being rude, overbearing, arrogant, and just being an all around douchebag. i humbly apologise to anyone who reads this. goodnight.",Negative

taxi didn't have the right of the way. no sane traffic law will allow 2 vehicles on opposing direction that intersect each other to have right of the way at the same time,Positive
that cannot happen.,Neutral
"the fact of the matter is: in any sg junction, if a right turn is not specifically marked by a red arrow, vehicles turning right can make their own judgement on whether or not the opposite straight is clear and empty.if there's incoming vehicles, those going straight get right of way. otherwise if the opposite straight (and similarly pedestrians path is empty) and it is safe to make the turn, you can go ahead.looking at the video, it seems like the taxi driver did not make the correct judgement; it is highly likely that his view of the incoming straight traffic is blocked by the car to his left and in front of him. he basically played ""follow the leader"", or ""hey, that other guy is turning. sure the road is clear one i can turn also."" instead, that other turning guy made the turn on the barest of margins: he knows he is only very just going to clear the turn in time. anyone who's even slightly slower (e.g. that taxi) would not make it.(similarly, it is likely that the guy going straight only saw the taxi at the last moments, the view almost entirely blocked by the first turning car)this is all but standard, not only in sg but worldwide. i'm guessing you have not taken your basic driver rules test yet?",Positive

"if a vehicle is in the distance and is unlikely to reach the junction by the time you complete your turn, you can go ahead and make the turn.the problem here is that the right turning vehicles here decided to play very closely with margins of error.

"amk hub has a similar design, in order: a very popular bus stop just before a fucking crowded traffic light junction, a left turn into amk central, entry/exits for amk hub, a pedestrian crossing that has a overhead bridge right above it screaming ""use me"", entry/exit of amk hub's taxi stand, then another traffic light junction where buses turn left to go to the interchange but are usually slowed down by the hordes of people crossing the zebra crossing at the left turn.",Positive

"i am not sure if you know this, but for alot of the buses that operate in singapore, the bodywork is assembled in singapore or jb. for sbs i know they use gemilang in jb.the chassis of the bus comes in (engine, suspension, exhaust and it is bare bone) from the manufacturer and it looks like this:[https://landtransportguru.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gemilang-coachworks-man-a95-facelift-38.jpg](https://landtransportguru.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gemilang-coachworks-man-a95-facelift-38.jpg)gemilang then adds the body works as specified by sbs or it's customer. these body works includes lights, seats, doors etc. the exhaust is part of the chassis along with the pipingso there is no way gemilang can and will change how the exhaust is piped out because it is part of the chassis. i also must add that any modification done to the chassis that is not done by the actual manufacturer may not always be legal in singapore.&#x200b;note: any modification to the chassis done by gemilang would also make the warranty for the bus chassis void",Positive
i've always thought that the new buses sounded bloody loud compared to the older buses. like i-need-earplugs kinda loud.and i've always suspected cuz the procurement team didn't do their fucking specification properly and only told the vendors they wanted the driver and doors switched sides and not the exhaust.now my suspicious are (partially) confirmed.,Negative

drivers who choose to drive while fatigued are willfully endangering the people around them. that's generally something we don't allow people to do. would you be ok with your pilot falling asleep while s/he's landing the plane? heck no. so why tolerate it with taxis?,Neutral
praise,Neutral
i agree its not ok but as concerned citizens we should also help them out by being concerned of their welfare. maybe engage in conversation and ask them to stop for a break if its bad. ask nicely. drivers drive long hours. they dont earn if they take a break instead incurring costs when they take long breaks. pilots on the other hand have their own regime to adhere to. i'm not a pilot but i'm sure they can rest during flight while a co pilot takes over. during landing of course they'll be awake coz they are prepared for that half hour or so duration. so try not to compare their job scopes.,Positive
"but that's exactly right -- during flight, a copilot can take over. your driver has no replacement. if he is so fatigued he is falling asleep, he's putting people's lives at risk. that's not ok, just as it would not be ok if a pilot or any other person is losing consciousness while operating heavy machinery with human lives onboard.",Positive

there's a very simple answer to this change shift problem that i don't understand why lta hasn't implemented it yet. any driver that says change shift should not be allowed to pick up passengers. they should go straight to their change shift destination and actually change shift. saves time and gas and makes the taxi available much quicker. it also discourages taxi drivers from this loophole to pick and choose passengers and destinations.,Positive

"since he pays for his taxi rental instead of you, you can't sack him, or is that hard for you to understand?if you really want to make a change in their thinking, jumping into their cabs will only make them more antagonistic. just go uber/grabcar like everyone else. they'll change their tactics as revenues go down.",Positive

"yeah, sometimes they just want a specific type of trip to net more customers at destination. or they are doing cab sharing without the cab company knowledge. (i remember not finding the cab driver license displayed in the cab once)",Positive

"uber is great for customers but it's actually pretty bad for drivers. they have to do a set number of trips to fulfill their quota in order to get the incentives and cannot reject any trip in that time period, so if each one is long and end up at ulu areas it's a lot harder to fulfill. is uberx marketed the same way in other parts of the world? like, comparable to local taxi services but cheaper?",Positive
that's not really fair to op. just because there's an alternative of grabtaxi/uber does not mean he is obligated to use those alternatives when there are many green lit cabs on the road for him to flag down. cabby knows the rules and it's just suay for him that he met someone who knows the rules too and can't get away with whatever stunt he's pulling.op's tone isn't bitter - if anything he sounds more principled than bitter (and a little indignant which is understandable given his 90yo fil + rain + potentially antsy wife).,Positive

"if he's not doing his job then he should be sacked (same as you, me, and anybody else).i jumped into his cab because he stopped at a taxi stand with his green light on.  green light means ""open for business"".  lta says taxi stopping at taxi stand with green light on cannot refuse to take the fare.  you seem to have trouble understanding this basic concept.",Negative
>it would be wrong even if the law authorized it.this is a whole other debate about ethics and whatnot. i'm just surprised at how you jumped to the conclusion that op forces himself on women. you derived that implication from the way he said he treated a taxi driver. just chill out,Negative
"what kind of weird ass reasoning is this? the taxi uncle agreed to whatever ruling the lta has when they took up this job. it is their job to take their customer to wherever he's going.applying your logic, a waiter can refuse to bring you a glass of water or take your order with no repercussions. it is after all not ethical to force him to serve you. or maybe i can refuse to settle my client's problems at work tomorrow.

yep. i stay in a city in pa in the us and i see around one taxi a month on average. called the cab company a couple of times for a pickup but no one fulfilled my requests. god knows what people were doing before uber/ lyft came about.,Negative
"while it might be true he is not obligated to use the alternatives, it is also true that taxi drivers are not obligated to pick you up. they could just drive past you. i get annoyed too that they pick and choose passengers but i don't pay their taxi rent. they're not busses or trains where they are subsidized by the government.",Positive

nothing wrong. but surely u can indicate the location first.,Negative
"which part are you wrong? >the part where he bullied an old man this part? the regulations are on his side, and the old man is not following them, so that's bullying? some true amaze. ",Positive
"since your reading comprehension skills are lacking, let me clarify for you.i did not force myself into the taxi.  the driver stopped at a designated taxi stand with his green light on (indicating he was available for pickup).  we entered the cab then indicated our destination.  the driver tried to back out of his responsibility to take us to our destination by claiming that he was changing shift.i reminded the driver of his obligation under the lta and told him i would report him if he did not do his job.",Positive
"except again, you can't sack him because we don't pay his taxi rent.just like you can't sack a property agent from cea just because he doesn't want to sell your house. cea can suspend or revoke his license if a property agent does something wrong just like lta may revoke errant taxi drivers license.you seem massively entitled.",Negative
"erm... a waiter can refuse your request for a glass of water or take your order.i finished a meeting the other day and i went to dinner. the waiter said that they don't serve water and i had to order a drink. i llst, ordered a red wine and made a note never to go back again.just like you can with taxi drivers.",Negative
"well, i never see them approaching people and are intently watching the passengers and taxis.also, according to ltahttps://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/public-transport/taxis/getting-a-taxi.htmltaxis are not allowed to have a green sign and reject customers. they obviously circumvent this by zooming past you. i honestly don't know how to solve this unless we subsidise taxi drivers and then mandate the minimum pick ups they have to perform after midnight and peak hours.",Positive
i totally agree with you. it is messed up.,Neutral
i think the us market is an exception (and why uber is successful there for slightly different reasons) because it seems like in most places in the us taxis just didn't exist or were very rare. in in most of the rest of the world taxis exist and uber is competing on price more than anything else.,Positive
"i believe under traffic regulations and possibly as a term of their taxi rental contract they probably have an obligation to take your fare when they stop for you. when they whizz past and don't stop, that's them exercising their right not to pick you, and you ll. but that position changes when they stop at the side of the road when you flag them, or likely when they are in a taxi stand queue.",Negative
"yeah dude. you might be young but let's consider this. the government used to bully people who own land in singapore. to get the land to develop, the government would invoke the law and buy the land at $1. so the regulations are on the government's side but you will be hard pressed to find anyone who won't say that the government is the bully in this story. similarly, he could have gotten a willing driver via grab. but he insisted on having his way and even threatened the driver with the law. that remind you of anyone?",Negative
"no, my reading comprehension skills are all there. thanks for the weak-ass insult.you clearly are not a very nice person and it shows in your behaviour on and off-line. i hope you don't have children because we need more gracious people in singapore.in case your reading comprehension skills are lacking, here's my take. you were technically in the right for him to take you where you needed to go since he was clearly green. but instead of being an adult and calling an uber or grabtaxi, you petulantly forced a man to take you where you wanted to go. you are a manchild.",Positive
"lol.  of course i can't sack him, but i can report him.  if he receives enough complaints then i expect his company would sack him.  rightly so.  same for me, same for you, same for anybody.yes i am massively entitled that i would have the gall to consider reporting somebody for not doing their job.on the other hand you seem massively defensive and are expending a lot of effort to defend the indefensible.  what's the matter?  you've been sacked a few times for not doing your job?",Negative
"except all taxi drivers are forbidden by lta to flash a green sign and not pick up passengers. if there are laws mandating that all restaurants serve water when requested, then it wouldn't be wrong to threaten to report them when they refuse to.",Negative
"there was a local cab company in my area in the us, and they were usually quite reliable in sending out cabs whenever i called, but would take like 15 minutes to get to me even though their cabs would be only 1 mile away. began to wise up and build relationships with the individual drivers, get their name cards and would 100% get a cab at cheaper rates and faster response times when i called them personally.",Positive
"it's damn bloody easy to put change shift on top. you know the type that always stop at the taxi stand and drive off picking and choosing. he didn't report the guy, and that might have been bullying, he simply made the guy do his damn job. i saw your comment about the waitress, and your reply was completely inane. it's as if the waitress just didn't want to serve you water because she didn't want to get it. and about your wine, yeah she doesn't want to get that either. if you threaten to complain to the manager, are you being a bully? how does that make a single ounce of sense? of course the government is a bully sometimes, but this is clearly not one of those situations.",Positive
i'm not defending them. i actually agreed with you that he wasn't keeping up his end since he is bound by regulation to pick you up.why are you so butthurt that you are slinging personal insults? it's not very nice to insinuate that i can't do my job just because i disagree with your methods towards old men.hope you don't lose your job when you get older and have to be forced to drive a taxi. manchild.,Positive
"this i agree, that's wrong for them to do it and feign ignorance. but it is also needlessly cruel to force them to take you where you want to go just because the law says otherwise.it would appear i am alone in being compassionate on this.",Negative
"i believe i must has been unclear.some restaurants don't serve still water for free, usually for revenue reasons. i don't get upset at the waitress for the business decisions of the restaurant. if i started taking pictures of the restaurant and threaten the restaurant with instagram infamy if they don't bring me free water, i'd be a real bully.the way i see it, the cabbie not wanting to ferry people to certain locations is purely a revenue decision. i do not begrudge people for acting in their own self-interest especially since cabbies are on the hook for their own rent. it is not the cabbie's job to ferry you. it is the cabbie's job to earn money by ferrying you. like i said earlier, when we start subsidising taxi drivers on their rent, then i believe that we as passengers have the right to dictate where they go.",Positive
i'm not butthurt.  i'm trying to understand your motivation for defending bad work.  one possibility was that you had been on the receiving end of complaints and had lost your job over it.slinging insults?  one of your first responses to my post was to call me an asshole.  i think i've been quite patient with you under the circumstances.anyway... lunchtime is over.  i don't have time to spoonfeed the troll anymore.,Negative
"and what about the taxi uncle refusing to pick you up is the decision of the taxi company and not the taxi uncle? your logic is incredibly flawed and you've chosen to double down on it. it's like if you said you wanted to pay and the waitress said no. i don't want to bring you the water. it is not a revenue decision, they do not have a choice.",Negative
you are the troll i m afraid,Negative
"while we are talking about possibilities, perhaps one possibility for your bad behaviour is your parents never taught you to respect people.how did you convince your wife to marry you? was it your winning personality forcing old men to do what you want? or because you just can't stand injustice so much that you force old men to do what you want? you say you have principles, did they come from your parents who told you to trample on others?see, those are just possibilities.",Positive
it's a revenue decision for the restaurant. but it's not up to the waitress whether on not she can give me free water.my point is that you could choose to get angry and vindictive at someone who doesn't want to serve you. or you could go to another restaurant that serve you better. or pay for the premium of getting guaranteed service.,Positive
"once again your analogy is flat out wrong. this is like the restaurant having paid water, you wanting to pay and the waitress refusing to serve this. you're being purposely obtuse at this point.",Negative
"i'm quite sure i'm not ""flat out wrong"" and frankly very rude.just because you can pay for the water, it doesn't mean that they must serve you the water.just because you can pay for the ride and they are legally obligated to give you the ride, that doesn't make it morally right for you to compel someone to do something they don't want to do.i think you are being deliberately obtuse this time. my point is that it is not right to force people to do things they don't want to do. people who do that are bullies.",Positive
thebigsplat is just stupid. so just ignore him,Negative
"> just because you can pay for the ride and they are legally obligated to give you the ride, that doesn't make it morally right for you to compel someone to do something they don't want to do.annnnd all your arguments have gone kaput you're bringing morals into this? that's fucking retarded. the government wants to have a certain level of public transport, as such has agreements with taxi operators. and so, these taxi operators have agreements with taxi drivers. you can't just blatantly ignore the system and say ""its not morally correct"". yeah i'd agree it's not very nice to ""bully"" a person to drive you home. it does seem like a dick move. but its an equally dick move to take a job and not do it. to selectively serve certain people cos its easier or more beneficial. that's not doing your part of the job. ",Positive
"again dude, how are my arguments kaput?the taxi drivers are independent operators that are in charge of their own revenue. just like their own business. despite having regulations put on them, we are not their masters. and i have agreed multiple times that it is wrong for them to put a green sign and refuse customers. if they are open for business, then they should do their business.try to follow me here, it is not their job to ferry you to where you want to go. like all businesses, it is their job to make money. you might be too young to understand how businesses work or you think you deserve service just because you have 5 bucks in your pocket.they are independent operators that are not beholden to the passenger. they are beholden to lta's rules just like all citizens and taxi license holders.maybe when you grow up, you'll learn more empathy for people or figure out why businesses exist.",Positive
"because when you enter into a legal agreement, you don't bring morals into the question. taxi drivers are contractually obliged to take a passenger to a location when they get into the cab. true false?>  it is not their job to ferry you to where you want to go*face palm* oh wow. seriously? now you're just trying to be all vague and philosophical. jobs don't work like that. you take a job, you have a job requirements to fulfill. and part of a taxi drivers requirements is to drive people to their destination. they're not allowed to cherry pick passengers based on destination. >  you might be too young ... maybe when you grow up....oh please. getting petty now? how about you grow up and start forming better arguments that are not powered off emotions and feelings. see, i will totally agree that morally speaking, its not a nice thing to do to a taxi driver. it sucks for him if the fare going to a really out of the way area. however, **you cannot deny he is contractually obliged to do it** ",Positive
"i think you need to look into what forms a legal agreement before you start talking about legal agreements, what constitutes a job and what they should do. like dude, i am literally agreeing with you that they should not reject fares based on whatever cooked up reasons. i am not fighting you on that. but you need to realize that they are not paid to work for you. they are allowed to do things that do not make financial sense for them. they can be punished for making those decisions. that's it.

"tldr: always the case? noooo. salary generally being higher, yes. but that's because the cost of living is also higher. need to make quite a bit of lifestyle change if you want to save more, or as much as in sg. anecdotally, i myself found that i could save more in sg than in sydney. * **food**. in sg almost everyone tapaus or eat out. in aus tapauing is much more ex, e.g. a caipng (rice with 2 dishes, no differentiation between meat or vege) is usually aud10. of course got outliers e.g. 1 hour before closing at 4pm tapau rice + 1 dish is aud5, which is probably the cheapest you can get for a meal in sydney, but you'll have to be there at the right time. are you able to drive to the food court to grab this at 4pm while you're working? probably not. * of course most people cook their own meals here, and we should also do that, but you'll have to sacrifice some time (e.g. 1/2 hour) everyday for that, or cook once during weekend and reheat over the week. like i said, need to make lifestyle changes, and we found it difficult to start cooking frankly, much easier to think about what we wanna eat then go buy it. * **transport**: car is definitely much much cheaper here, can get laopok car for aud1k, but for a good 2nd hand car maybe about aud10k lah. new car maybe aud30k. and while the public transport isn't absolutely terrible, there's a lot of places you can't reach without a car. and with a car comes associated costs. tax + insurance = 100/month, maybe monthly fuel costs = 200, maybe a averaged yearly maintenance + fixes = 500, lets say 50/month, that will be 350/month at least, not including the down payment for the car. think sg is about [150/month for transport](https://www.guidemesingapore.com/relocation/introduction/singapore-cost-of-living)? * of course you get the freedom of having a car, and personally i love it, with the great australian road system, and i love going on long road trips, so much cheaper than flights and freedom to stop whenever you want. we drove from syd to melbourne and syd to brisbane the first few years we were here, i loved it. * **housing**: i think housing is about the same if you're renting. buying is a totally different story that i'm currently painfully experiencing personally, so we won't go there. anyway i think there are many more places that elaborate on details with much more sources than me, this is just a personal anecdote. i always tell people singapore is good for working, sydney is good for living. in singapore a lot of things are geared towards you spending more time at work (maid = less time cleaning the house yourself, shops open late > 5pm, more corporate hqs in sg = better career advancements), whereas in sydney you have more time for life, but more things to do (can leave work at 5pm, but need to cook/clean house/mow backyard/fix car).

see: doublethink,Neutral
"driverless vehicles operate with significantly greater efficiency mainly due to the fleet control and in parts, due to the lack of a human driver (rest time, laziness etc). if a central system can control cabs and move them around the country to areas that require them at different times of the day, then more passengers can be ferried with fewer vehicles. cab fares might also drop.when the cab services are more accessible and affordable, car-ownership would become less attractive.",Positive

"i think that they probably were referring to our overall size as an island - which is quite small - only 50 klms wide by 25 klms high (approx.)the fact that it is an island is actually somewhat irrelevant - because there are two vehicles bridges to malaysia so it is not like the cars are ""trapped"" here...",Negative
"total car ownership will drop, but number of cars on the road will remain. the problem is passengers, not number of cars owned - most of these will be parked in carparks for the vast majority of the time. you're assuming that car pooling will occur (and i agree that if car pooling occurs, congestion will drop), but i think this is a bad assumption. car pooling can already happen now with taxis - why don't 3 strangers that all want to go to amk pool up and share a cab right now? afaik, car pooling (or on-demand pooling, more accurately - i believe scheduled car pooling is not infrequent) is not a thing anywhere in the developed world other than as a response to mandated minimum passenger lanes.in short, i don't think this will do a thing for road congestion. it will however affect taxis negatively, and open up more car parking and efficient use of prime land.",Positive
"thanks. that makes sense.thinking about it, it will be damn shiok if these self-driving taxis cost at least 50% cheaper than current taxis.",Negative
"well, the government consistently complains about there being too many cars on the roads, so i don't think they'll have anything to say about auto drive cars reducing the number of cars on the road.",Positive
"trucks and delivery drivers need people to load and unload goods and communicate with people. companies can have them do other work if driving is really no longer needed. ambulance make up a tiny percentage of the vehicles, and they probably have better stuff to do. car salesman can go and sell other stuff. maintenance is still needed because cars are still cars. erp and parking revenue is literally pocket change to the government.",Positive

"the term ""land-locked"" refers to the state of being surrounded by land...basically, countries with no connection to sea, this, when read within the context of the article, bears little or no relevance at all. the article was talking about the need to reduce vehicle numbers and to create space where the term ""land-locked"" appeared. my guess is that it was meant to describe the space-constraint that singapore is currently facing.",Negative
"good points. actually the number of cars on the road might even increase, as passengers who normally take buses/trains will be tempted to take self-driving taxis instead.though, i believe if enough cars become self-driven, even if the number of cars on the roads remain the same, congestion will be eased. this is possible if the self-driven cars network with each other to optimize the best routes to take collectively. also, if networked, self-driving cars can ""flow"" in sync, instead of the way human driven cars start rolling off only after the car in front of them starts to move.",Positive
"it decreases the barrier to entry. previously knowing how to drive is a must, now knowing how to drive is a plus. the wage level is probably going to decrease. might give us more ambulance though, since there is -1 requirement per vehicle. car salesman wise i suppose they can technically go sell other stuff, sales skills are essentially transferable. might not get as much commission though. according to the article, the number of vehicle will decrease from 900,000 to 300,000. a 66.6% decrease in number of vehicles will defiantely affect the maintainance business.  erp and parking might be pocket change but there's still coe, vehicle tax, road tax, gst for fuel, and all the other related fees and charges",Positive

"there will also be fewer cars circling looking for or driving to or from a parking spot or garage. in some cities it's estimated that 30% of traffic in congested areas are because of that.

"> # justgrab passenger calls taxi driver ‘absolute failure of a man’ during argument> justgrab allows you to book a taxi or a private hire car near you at a slightly more affordable rate than a normal grabcar.> on october 9, 2019, a video was uploaded showing a lady on a justgrab ride going at it with her driver for a good four to five minutes.> advertisement> the video begins with the driver insisting on following “his discretion” in finding a route for her. the passenger disagrees with that assertion, and his response is that a justgrab ride allows the driver to choose a route.> the argument appears to stem from the driver’s fear that they will be stuck in a jam if they took the lady’s requested route, which would be bad for him because grab’s fare doesn’t change even in a jam.> the lady, on the other hand, believes that as someone who apparently takes the same route consistently, he should follow her preferred route.> the video then cuts to a screenshot showing that if another route different from the gps one is to be taken, a mutual agreement has to be reached with the driver — but more on that later.> it is here that things go really off the wheels, with personal insults flying everywhere. the exchange was preceded by the taxi driver asking her not to “teach your father what to do”.> it is telling that the lady’s barbs also mention the driver’s competence as a father, perhaps as a rebuttal to his claim.> advertisement> here’s a transcript of their exchange during the more tense part, which appears to occur at the tail-end of the ride to rochor.> driver: … and you learn through experience. justgrab lady: if that’s the situation, then your family must be so disappointed with you because as a taxi driver, you are absolute failure. you are a failure of a father, you are a failure of a taxi driver. driver: i’m a failure? i’m a failure? ask yourself if you’re married, i tell you i cut off my head, if you’re a married woman today, i will empty my pocket and give it to you today. justgrab lady: if you are what a singaporean man is, nobody needs to be married, because you are absolute failure of a man, absolute failure of a man.> advertisement> the video, apparently initially shared by sg road vigilante although it appears to have been taken down, then shows a screenshot of what appears to be the lady commenting on her facebook page, which implies she might have posted the video on her facebook page.> here’s the majority of the video.> there also seems to be a screenshot of a one-star review, seemingly given to the driver.> advertisement> with regard to driving route, based on online sources, grab appears to heavily emphasise the need for a mutual agreement to be reached between passengers and driver.> we’ve reached out to grab for further information on the case and regarding this.---1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Negative
"i’d pull over and leave her on the side of the highway. drivers should be empowered to reject and eject abusive riders. but this is sg, where people expect you to put up with anything because they pay you a few dollars. a minor disagreement on the route to take escalates into an existential crisis. the uncle attempted to take a dig at her spinster status and guess he hit a raw spot... or maybe it’s that time of the month for her. or menopause.",Negative

pretty scary edmw already identified and shamed her.,Positive
tommy koh was correct,Neutral
no doubt the driver should have final say to the route but sounds more like the lady is just retaliating harder to the driver's provocations. she was responding to his attacks of being less knowledgeable than him and being an unwanted woman.,Positive
both driver's and passenger's have strong and interesting remarks. &#x200b;i must say i have met my fairshare of drivers who refuse to follow my instructed route. and then within 3 minutes they drive into a jam and we are stuck for 20 minutes. grab drivers should just follow instructions.,Positive

"in that case you shouldn't use justgrab or any fixed fare service. when a customer selects this service, he forfeits that interest.",Positive
"yes. there are mutual grounds too. but all things equal (my experience vs your experience), would result in the driver having the say. also do note that there is currently no service that guarantees reaching by within how many min. somehow i think this must be mentioned too. sometimes taxi (car) rides can be longer than train.",Positive
how was she as a teacher?,Neutral
"are you referring to this incident? i've scrolled through all the comments and none did any of the 'attacking the woman's looks' you mentioned. as for the second, again, maybe i need to read closer but who's 'attacking' the woman for simply being female? or are you talking about other posts? because /r/sg is nothing like edmw- not the profile of users nor the sentiments. sure there may be some black sheep but they'd get downvoted all the time.",Positive

"yes. but the driver is not experienced at all, and i know the best route to my office in the morning. hence, whenever the driver does his own thing, he drives me right into a jam.",Positive

then you should have taken a taxi instead.,Neutral
"client ask contractor to do something illegal, contractor will do it? please lar, that is the reason why there are t&cs for such relationships",Negative
"the problem with this argument is that for a fixed fare, you are paying for the service of being transported from point a to point b. how the service is rendered to you is up to the service provider.for metered fare, you are paying by time/distance, and thus you are paying for the service of being driven around and can dictate which road to take.to tell a flat fare driver (taxi or phv) which route to take is akin to telling the char kway teow auntie to put the eggs in first before noodles. sure, maybe that's the way you prefer it but she is under no obligation to do so as long as you get a plate of char kway teow at the end.",Positive
"well that's what exactly toxic masculinity calls toxic — the gender roles that us men are expected to live up to. if women should be emancipated from their traditionally submissive roles, men should also be free from the destructive ideals of dominance, aggression and the pursuit of high social status.",Positive
"it is absolutely toxic feminity and not masculinity in this case but try discussing ""toxic feminity"" with a 'feminist' and see where that gets you.",Positive
"even grab's website states that driver has the right to take the fastest or shortest route as available by a gps. we can argue that this driver here wasnt going by a gps but, still doesn't say that passengers get to choose their preferred route. in your case, you can thank the drivers who've picked you so far that they've gone beyond their expected service. or maybe it's just comfort. maybe grab just sucks. btw i was curious and wondering if you are the belmont lay aka tchotchke from that-must-not-be-named. so i went to look at your profile. and oh my.........",Negative
"first comment- he commented that this woman fits his perception of a stereotypical middle-age woman of a certain social-economical background who is self-entitled. you might wanna accuse him of, well, stereotyping maybe but there's nothing offensive towards her gender perse. he is not saying 'all woman are self-entitled', or 'she is expected to be self-entitled and cunty because she is a female'. second comment- again where's the attacking? he does make a rather sweeping statement but it has nothing to do with what you claimed. there isn't any hostility targeted towards a woman because of her gender. thanks for bringing up that there's two deleted comments. if they truly did post sexist sentiments, i think they already know they don't belong. thus, confirming what i feel about the r/sg is nothing like edmw, lol phew.",Positive
i'm the poster of the first comment. i don't see how my comment was sexist and i wasn't attacking her looks either. all i said was she had a certain look. that's all.,Positive
"the source video came from the lady, so we can't be sure who started with the nasties.",Positive
"thanks, for pointing that out. and that exchange was preceded by amanda saying flatly 'no, i know this way better than you' and subsequently, 'well, apparently, you are wrong because...'. she has been arrogant from the start.  but yes, playing the age card is a rather condescending thing to do. however, the main issue, that prompted op's comment, is the personal attacks made by amanda.",Positive

"one true scotsmanwhile you are technically right, it is a reasonable claim that feminism has become largely diluted and associated with negative impressions nowadays. illogical as it is i think keeping the core concepts the same and renaming it would be better in the long run, since when two people talk about feminism they usually aren't talking about the same thing",Positive
"according to article (i can't really see the meter on the video), the driver in this scenario **is** a taxi driver. justgrab can get you both phv/taxi drivers to accept the job.",Positive
"your suggestion also don't work. i travel the same route for the past 3 years. i am the most experienced. so it doesn't matter whether its grab driver or taxi driver, my interest is to reach the destination fastest, and i (and usually other passengers) is the best person to determine so.",Positive
lol. the strong and interesting remarks.,Positive
"again, this is beside the point. don't misunderstand and conflate separate issues. the point is that the driver should listen to the passenger, who understands the usual routes better. the passenger's interests and driver's interests are aligned. especially since grab is private hire driver, the grab driver should take instructions directly from passenger. if a driver is for hire on a private basis, the hirer is the client and should be allowed to instruct the driver.",Positive
you realise that you are using a bad example right? please lar. don't be a kkj and use a lousy and extreme example. we are only discussing about asking drivers to follow customer's preferred routes. client asking contractor on how to perform services is par for the course and ordinary.,Negative
"okay. i take your point. but the problem as i highlighted is that the driver may choose a lousy route (long or further for us) if he doesn't follow my instructions. this is definitely incorrect: ""how the service is rendered to you is up to the service provider."" what if the driver wants to take a very long route?",Positive
found the true incel,Positive
"i think you guys have misconstrued what the phrase can mean — ""toxic masculinity"" concerns *conceptions* of masculinity too (e.g. you have to be a rich and successful in your career to be a real man) rather than only behaving in  ""manly"" ways that hurt people. in this case, the woman calling him ""a failure of a man"" reinforces toxic masculinity by implying he's a failure for not being a billionaire ceo. not because ""toxic feminity"" doesn't exist, she's a toxic ass person anyhow",Positive
woman can be sexist and condescending towards man but the reverse is unacceptable. this is the state of feminism in singapore today.,Neutral
"doxxing is bad because vigilantism is done by amateurs. there are no checks and balances if the perpetrator is rightfully targeted or if the outcome and impact of the doxx is ultimately more severe than what the social crime deserves.unlike the ""issit because i'm chinese lady"" , this swirly colored yoga ball outted herself on social media. she then proceeded to attempt to remove this driver's livelihood in a proclamation of victory. she has effectively removed all restraint by herself. it's quite a remarkable feat how well one might do to dig their own grave.whatever that comes to her if it comes to her, she is well deserving of every iota. the only recourse for her is a swift public apology. delaying further by the hour only makes it worse.",Positive
"watch the video. she doxxed herself. now that public opinion has (rightly) turned against her she suddenly wants to be anonymous?she was scathing and gloating about how she fucked him 3 ways, trying to break his rice bowl. see it for yourself and tell yourself if we should protect people like this, if there’s no shaming of her actions which is a societal check for acceptable behaviour, if such behaviour won’t become more common.",Positive

yeah because they would rather spend the extra 5 minutes to avoid situations like these.,Neutral

"if you travel the same route for the past 3 years maybe it's time to look for long-term transport arrangements if your office is too inaccessible by public transport?be it grab or taxis it's the driver's right to choose the route they take, and they're staking their earnings on it : for fixed fare rides, be it 10 minutes or 1 hour, your pay isn't affected (assuming you're not late), but theirs is. if you're that uncomfortable with the drivers choosing their route or following gps, maybe negotiate before the ride.good news for you is that taxi drivers are required to ask you for your preferred route, at least according to [lta website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/public-transport/taxis%20and%20private%20hire%20cars/getting-a-taxi.html)",Positive

"> what if the driver wants to take a very long route? drivers lose time, energy, fuel, customer satisfaction for taking a very long route in fixed fare rides, where time = money, energy = money, fuel = money and customer satisfaction (maybe) = money. which one looks like an incentive for drivers to take a long route?even for metered rides, the drivers benefit the most for short distance rides due to the upfront rates, so that is pretty questionable.",Positive

"**toxic masculinity**the concept of toxic masculinity is used in psychology and media discussions of masculinity to refer to certain cultural norms that are associated with harm to society and to men themselves. traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered ""toxic"" due in part to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. the socialization of boys often normalizes violence, such as in the saying ""boys will be boys"" with regard to bullying and aggression.self-reliance and emotional repression are correlated with increased psychological problems in men such as depression, increased stress, and substance abuse.***^[ [^pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=wikitextbot&message=excludeme&subject=excludeme) ^| [^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/singapore/about/banned) ^| [^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com/r/wikitextbot/wiki/index) ^| [^source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/wikitextbot)   ^]^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",Negative

"and the belief that women are to be respected and served at every whim and call regardless of their treatment of men is not toxic feminity? or the fact that the belief that there is perhaps no expectation of the conformity of the uncle to traditional masculine stereotypes but the privilege that she enjoys conforming to her traditional stereotype of having the capability to decide what is masculine or not and his marriageability is somehow ""toxic masculinity"" despite there seeming to have no effect on the uncle in this case and more effect on her?think about it for a sec. quoting me a definition doesn't change the fact that discrimination against women is called sexism and discrimination against men is called ""toxic masculinity"". call a spade a spade. sexism is sexism regardless of who it is applied against. if you really claim to be for equality, then let's call this what it is: sexism.",Positive

"in every country, taxis exist to provide a public service by getting paying customers from where they are to where they want to go. no extra fees are involved for things like booking online, paying by credit card/electronic payment, etc., because the taxi operator understands that a) if he doesn't provide the service, his competitors will, and b) it's a drop in the bucket compared to the increased revenue and profits.taxis in singapore exist to provide yet another means of transferring money from ordinary people to those above. in the process, they lease cabs profitably to (mostly) older uncles who need to support themselves and their families after being turned out of their ""normal"" careers because they're ""too old"". (there's one taxi brand that seems to have more than their fare share of dubious characters/likely triad members as drivers, but their reputation is getting around).in other words, it's like democracy in singapore. there are cabs on the street, just as there are mps in parliament, leading the unwary to assume that those things work pretty much as they do elsewhere. attempting to put that assumption into useful practice is rarely as successful as betting one's entire income on the 4d. (providing yet another demonstration of the word ""assume"" as shorthand for ""making an @$$ out of u and me"".)having a taxi system in singapore that functions comparably to those elsewhere will, like anything else benefitting the ordinary person here, take a change of government priority more than sufficient to require a change of government.",Positive

"was just waiting for a cab while this happened in front of me. the bus driver was trying to overtake a vehicle in front of it and he cut to the left lane, but he must’ve been frustrated or forgot that the roof was there.fortunately no one was injured, a lot of broken glass around but no one was sitting at that seat. could’ve been pretty tragic.roof 1 : 0 bus",Negative

i have still not gotten over the end of toyota crown era. so much legroom....,Positive
idk why but the smell inside a taxi always makes me nauseous :(,Neutral
i miss the crown more than the sonata,Positive
"not everyone will care about it, but these taxis have had significance to me, especially when i was still in kindergarten. i believe this was back in 2007 and vividly my mother arriving and bringing me home in a sonata, which was the first ever time i ever got a ride in one.      following this, i saw less and less toyota crown taxis on the road and sonatas took their place. and now the sonatas are the ones being phased out in favour of newer models like the i40, prius, ioniq hev/ev and the kona ev.      every time i board a sonata and reach my destination, i’ll snap some photos with my phone as they won’t be around for much longer. and many of the sonatas i’ve previously boarded have been replaced with newer models, making my photos a thing i can keep for memory.    though not everyone is as enthusiastic about taxis as i am, it’s legitimately quite sad to see less and less sonatas on our roads.",Negative

"will it every be possible to import an older toyota crown after another 10-15 years under the classic car scheme, then wrap yellow and put the city cab sticker?",Positive
i will miss the cab. but won’t miss all the pandan smell it brings along. a very traumatic smell even after more than a decade. always having migraines after getting off cabs with like 10 bunch of pandan all around.,Positive
"crown - sonata - and few silverline / scoda cars. miss those ones. plenty of boot space, legroom and easy to recognize from a distance. added to that, a cousin bought the blue sonata in 2004, and in a short while, comfort decided to deploy hundreds of sonata :)",Positive
the new era is honda vezel,Positive
i rmb them as the first wave of automatic taxis and the ones replacing the manual cabs,Positive
i miss the cedric more. seems a lot more stylish to me. probably why i have an interest in boxy and angular cars until now.,Positive

i brought a living room rug home from ikea in the cabin of a crown once. that would be impossible in today's taxis.,Negative
"taxi drivers often used pandan leaves as air fresheners, maybe that's why they all smelt like that",Neutral
i think that was the corona with round headlights.,Negative

">the photos of people lying down on the field or in the forestcompared to the tropics, temperate climates can have fewer issues with biting insects in the cooler parts of the year. temperate regions generally also have lower insect biodiversity. so a bunch of people enjoying a camping trip in the forest in spring or early autumn is legit. it also helps that they *have* spring or early autumn, so they can wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants to fend off insects without baking themselves in the heat and perspiration like we do here.it works. just not in these parts of the world..",Positive

"you beat up a taxi uncle, what defence do you have? douchebag",Neutral
"lots of reasons, and combinations of reasons.  i'll speak specifically to the usa since i was raised here and this guy is from here.1.) most places have strict laws about cabbies refusing rides to passengers.  the law is on the side of the passenger here almost all the time.  that happened during the civil rights era, when cabbies wouldn't give rides to black people.  people feel entitled to a ride no matter what the cabbies disposition is toward them, and the law supports that.  this guy was denied a ride for a bs reason, really, even if it was technically illegal it's such a minor infraction so as to be completely irrelevant in most countries.  i've hailed taxis in the middle of a high-speed highway in nyc, in the middle of the night when there was no traffic.  illegal, but who cares.  now if i specifically found myself in this situation in singapore (or anywhere) i would find an alternative and forget about it, but this guy is on a crusade against all of singapore's unjust and cruel laws, based on his post history.  this isn't common among the general populace, but in the extreme right libertarian american is a righteous indignation against all unjust laws, no matter how trivial they want to impeach the president over it.2.) cabbies are generally old men in singapore, and old people in singapore demand a level of respect that we are not raised to care about.  our parents are the hippies, the ""call me by my first name"" types who didn't want to be like the stuffy ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" elders of their time.  we feel comfortable talking to a 60 year old uncle the same way we would talk to a 20 year old.  the 60 year old singaporean is generally super indignant and uncomfortable with that in cases of conflict, feeling the youth should give way to them.  this righteous indignation may cause taxi men to escalate confrontations that don't need escalating, and drunk passengers will be all too willing to worsen the escalation.  i don't have any personal experience with this, i like to strike up a conversation with a taxi uncle if they're willing, and they've always been super nice to me.  this opinion is based on interactions with my new singaporean family-in-law, i expect some taxi uncles must have this sort of disposition when they're confronted with behavior they consider unacceptable.3.) civilians cannot detain people here except under very serious, specific situations.  felonies, purse snatching and shoplifting are some examples of this (depending on jurisdiction) but petty squabbles are not.  so we're raised to believe that it's ok to kick the shit out of someone doing this to us.  if he really did snatch the guys stuff, then that is grounds enough for civilian detention even in most of the us.4.) racism / classism.  people generally look at a cabbie as a servant, not an equal, and are likely to treat them as such.  due to singapore's unique situation, that maybe isn't how you all feel about it, but in the usa our cabbies are most often uneducated immigrants who barely speak english.  in some cities i've been to they're rude as hell which can help foster a huge disrespect for their field.  if you are in a smaller city, you may have a low-paid local driver, but it's rare to find that.  i've worked in the service industry, and dealing with righteous holier-than-thou customers every day is a brutal, soul draining experience.  it takes a strong disposition to take that crap every day and stay polite.  so i imagine the taxi men may have a short fuse when it comes to indignant, uppity foreigners and maybe they try to put them in their place, escalating confrontations with asshole foreigners.these are obviously just stream-of-thought guesses, but it looks like i wrote a thesis on it now.  what has to be the #1 reason is that drunk people can be aggressive and extremely illogical in their interactions.  cabbies are their only transportation option late at night.  therefore some of that aggression is going to be taken out on the cabbies.",Negative

">cabby leaving the taxi, yeah that's weird.my theory: taxi driver realised how drunk they were and regretted letting them onto the taxi. they refused to leave, so he stepped out of the taxi to show that he wasn't going to drive them anywhere. it's still a weird chain of events, but the 2 passengers were probably too drunk to reason with, especially when you consider that they were standing in the middle of the road and the other events that followed.",Negative

"been seeing a surprising number of privately-owned kona evs around. it's nice to see them being picked up as taxis.i am curious about one thing though; taxis have to keep moving and evs have lower range (and thus need to charge), so what are ev taxi drivers' working patterns be like? do the low 'fuel costs' make up for waiting at charging stations? it never occured to me before, even after the byd taxi's became more widespread.",Positive

"power plants can burn gas far more efficiently than car engines. plus, we can slowly change our source of electricity to renewable types while non-electric cars will forever have to burn fuel.",Positive

"few charging stations, more expensive than conventional cars, and longer charging time than filling up your gas tank.",Negative

"the general stance of the government is ""don't own private cars"".",Positive
"technically you can, but its car tax structure has made it practically too costly.one of the them is road tax. lta used a very skewed table for ev based on motor power output, which they relate typical engine horsepower directly to ev's power output. the issue is ev delivers power and torque differently from ice, so a 1-to-1 comparison is not accurate. it's worse for tesla bcus they designed their cars to deliver a lot of torque, more than other evs. a porsche boxster road tax is $1.2k/yr. lambo at $5.8k/yr. tesla model 3? $4.9k/yr. tesla p100d? **$13.3k a year**",Negative
"no sponsorship from government. cars are all the same in the eyes of the government, so regardless of how they are powered, all are subjected to the same types of taxes and enjoy the same type of rebates. as to why, the government's eventual plan is to reduce private car ownership (by reducing coes available) and push people towards shared transport (includes car pool, car sharing, public transport) so they aren't going to incentivise private car ownership in any way. imo it's the best way to be environmentally friendly because even an electric car will consume more energy per pax compared to mass transit.",Positive
"i think you need to substantiate your claims. em called out sg gov not being supportive, but definitely not insisting on subsidies. he has acknowledged subsidies is useful to ev adoption, but not only to tesla, but to all other evs. in fact, tesla is enjoying half subsidy amt than other ev models in us today due to quota limit per manufacturer. car is expensive here, period. while we're paying 2-3x for a honda jazz here, we're paying 4x for a tesla. that's not even including road tax that are 4-5x more for equivalent models.my good guess is he's talking about infra support for evs adoption(ie. charging stations, common charging standards), ev friendly policies and issues like emissions surcharge slapped on a used tesla. on top of that, ridiculous road tax for tesla models. as my response to a previous post:>one of the them is road tax. lta used a very skewed table for ev based on motor power output, which they relate typical engine horsepower directly to ev's power output. the issue is ev delivers power and torque differently from ice, so a 1-to-1 comparison is not accurate. it's worse for tesla bcus they designed their cars to deliver a lot of torque, more than other evs.>a porsche boxster road tax is $1.2k/yr. lambo at $5.8k/yr. tesla model 3? $4.9k/yr. tesla p100d? $13.3k a year",Negative
"the 85d in your linked example, when being sold went for $100k in the uswhen it sells for nearly 4x the price here, there is some merit to tesla being concerned that it’s not achieving competitive parity, so it doesn’t even have to be a subsidy",Positive

"you're referring to [this case](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/electric-car-tesla-slapped-with-15000-tax-surcharge)? the car had to go for emissions testing as with all other imported cars and as a used car the motor consumed more power after wear and tear than a brand new car.>	in response to queries, an lta spokesman said: ""based on tests conducted under the unece r101 standards, the electric energy consumption of his imported used tesla car was 444 watt-hour/km."">	to ""account for co2 emissions during the electricity generation process"", the spokesman said, ""a grid emission factor of 0.5g/watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption"".>	from this, it was determined that mr nguyen's tesla produced 222g/km of co2, putting it within the $15,000 surcharge band under singapore's carbon emission- based vehicle scheme. the lta applied this grid factor once previously to an electric peugeot ion (a subcompact hatchback), and it was granted a carbon rebate of $20,000.he claimed in [another article](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-singapore-government-has-been-unwelcome-to-the-company) that we don't welcome electric cars here when bmw has already been selling their electric i3 here for quite some time. not to mention that byd and hyundai are supplying electric cars to grab/uber, and electric buses are being piloted out.from [this article](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/tesla-motors-is-leaving-singapore-31374.html), tesla left sg because ""the electric car maker has stated its business model is no longer viable there because of the lack of green technology tax break and subsidies from the economic development board of singapore"". it's pretty clear that their business model is unsustainable without government subsidies.",Positive
"it was reported like an onion news in intl media. when other countries are deciding on how much of subsidies, we slap it with a surcharge!?the surcharge and test was ridiculous on many levels:1. tailpipe tests run on used cars due varied engine conditions determining exhaust fumes , but tesla has no engine nor tailpape emissions. no test is required. efficiency is determined by design and driving conditions. new or used stock evs are the same. 2. they couldn't run a tailpipe test in this case, so they pointed to production of electricity, to insist ev produces co2. to level the comparison, they should also account c02 for production and distribution of petrol/diesel. and what if i decided to charge my car by solar and energy storage? 3. 444wh/km is too way off. the model s can easily averages 200wh/km (based of figures from existing owners). a model 3 can pull off a 160wh/km. instead of acknowledging flaws in testing and classifying evs, they doubled down and slapped it with a surcharge.",Positive
"neat, will give it a look, thanks",Positive
"yes referring to the same case, where the statement washere’s the full statement tesla sent us:> the model s that our customer imported into singapore left our factory in 2014 with energy consumption rated at 181 wh/km. as the land transport authority has confirmed, this qualifies as the cleanest possible category of car in singapore and entitles the owner to an incentive rather than a fine.> model s achieves this result because co2 emissions in gas-powered cars are far higher than in electric cars. in singapore, electricity generation releases roughly 0.5kgco2/kwh. based on energy consumption in model s of 181 wh/km, this results in 90 g co2/km. driving an equivalent gas-powered car like the mercedes s-class s 500 results in emissions of approximately 200 gco2/km. and because of oil extraction, distribution, and refining, approximately 25% more has to be added on top of that to calculate the real carbon footprint of gas-powered cars. that means an electric car like the model s has almost three times lower co2 per km than an equivalent gas-powered car. moreover, as singapore increases the percentage of grid power from solar and wind, the co2 from electricity drops with each passing year. > we are having cooperative discussions with the lta to ensure a proper understanding of these issues and to make sure that they are correctly testing our customer’s model s. based on the positive nature of those discussions, we are confident that this situation will be resolved soon.",Positive

"these large deer are [sambar](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/sambar.htm) - there's a population that lives in the central catchment nature reserve, although the current status of this species in singapore is ambiguous (i'll explain in a bit). there have been several roadkill incidents over the years, but this is the second recorded collision in 2018 - one was [hit along mandai road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sambar-deer-dies-after-being-hit-by-vehicle-in-mandai-road) in february. looking at how fast many people drive along mandai road and many of the other roads on the fringes of our nature reserves, plus these animals' tendency to [suddenly dash out](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/sambar-deer-dashes-across-mandai-road-in-rare-sighting), i'm not surprised that collisions happen from time to time.the sambar is native to southeast asian forests, and has been considered a historical component of our fauna (like the tiger and leopard); however, it seemingly vanished sometime during the 20th century. subsequently, a population was found occurring in our forests, but nobody is sure whether these represent sambar deer that had survived decades of hunting and deforestation and remained hidden all along, recent migrants that swam across from johor and reestablished themselves in their former range (much like the wild boar), or escapees from captivity; the possibility that some of the sambar kept at the singapore zoo escaped, then started breeding in the wild (making it an accidental reintroduction?) cannot be completely discounted. after all, most of these sambar sightings take place in the mandai area, which would make a lot of sense if the population is descended from zoo escapees. i haven't heard of anyone comparing genetic material from our wild sambar with those in the wrs collections, or with wild sambar from malaysia, which could clarify this situation. a smaller deer species that's found in southeast asia (and also historically known from singapore) is the [red muntjac](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/red-muntjac.htm) or barking deer; like the sambar, it was thought to be extinct, but there have been sightings here and there, and one was recorded on a camera in the forest in the macritchie area several years back. same thing with the sambar, nobody knows if these muntjac sightings represent a remnant population that's survived here all along, recent immigrants from johor, or former captives.as for the mousedeer (not the same family as deer per se), we have the [lesser mousedeer](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/lesser_mousedeer.htm) in the central catchment nature reserve. they're really shy, but if you're lucky, you might spot mousedeer in the forest along the trails; i've seen them in the macritchie, chestnut, and mandai areas.the [greater mousedeer](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/greater_mousedeer.htm) was thought to be extinct in singapore, but was rediscovered [in pulau ubin in 2008](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/2009nis373-378.pdf). if you stay overnight on the island and walk along the roads and trails in the quieter areas with a good flashlight, you might pick up the eyeshine of the mousedeer and see them moving about in the undergrowth, or even spot them crossing the road. a greater mousedeer was documented on camera [somewhere in the western catchment](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2015-008.pdf) in 2012, meaning this species is also present on mainland singapore.",Positive

"well... the price mechanism can only bring a *fair* allocation of resources by chance, since equity is a normative claim (afaik).the price mechanism fails more often than not in bringing about an *efficient* allocation anyway because the second welfare theorem only guarantees pareto, not allocative efficiency, and kaldor-hicks reallocation can apparently generate non-transitive consumption bundles because voodoo, i guess. also information asymmetry and all that ^*jazz ^hands*tl;dr: your invisible-hands waifu is shit. *shiiiiiiiiit*edit: i'm gonna have to get back on k-h intransivity, [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fpl00004095) seems to be the only source for itedit2: the price mechanism only causes allocative efficiency when a market clears (dd=ss and every buyer pays up to the price they are willing and able to accept), and all externalities are internalized, and no barrier to entry exists such that any producer producing at a quantity that is less than efficient is forced to accept competitors with the same cost structure who are willing and able to supply a larger quantity to lower price. this doesn't happen very much. i mean, it happens, but in certain situations in different markets.the op is unjustifiably being downvoted for pointing out that information asymmetry distorts the market; here, uber and grab know the exact qd and have a good profile of prices the market willing and able to accept. now, if the issue were purely one of price discrimination then it's merely a problem of surplus transfer (i.e. semi-perfect pd) and not of inefficiency, but there's no way to tell. while game theory suggests that price-competing n-polies crumble because any equilibrium outside p=mc incentivizes a player to lower prices by *ϵ* to capture the market, the reality is that capacity constraints (artificial or natural) and search costs cause the market to be allocatively inefficient. the point of all this is to say that price signalling is, without perfect information about the market, a weak proof of efficiency - movement in a theoretical/classical market has clear price signals, but, conversely, a price movement tells you nothing about the allocative efficiency of a market. for example, the cost structure of a monopoly firm may change due to one-time government intervention. dwl worsens because of a larger quantity gap, but no such information is embedded in the price. asset bubbles, too, represent a class of price signals gone awry.",Negative

"in economics, welfare is often measured by the surplus generated from a particular choice of distribution. for example, in a [classical demand-supply diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/economic-surpluses.svg/350px-economic-surpluses.svg.png), the welfare is the sum of two surpluses, and is maximized when the market clears (i.e., the favored bundle is at the red equilibrium point where the two curves cross). you can prove or see visually that if you deviate from that point, you generate inefficiency by consuming too little, or too much of something - [""deadweight loss""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deadweight_loss).a situation like this - maximized total surplus - is what is known as *allocative efficiency*, where the maximum amount of benefit is achieved per resources you spend.a *pareto efficient* point is different. a pareto efficient point is one where no one party can be made better without making another party worse off. for example, if the economy has ten donuts and we both have five, i cannot make you better off without making me worse off.however, is pareto efficiency also allocatively efficient? let's say i value donuts at 1u each (5u) and you value donuts at 5u each (25u). then, by giving all 10 donuts to you, we increase the total surplus from 30u to 50u. we have obtained an *allocative* improvement by 20u, but only by hurting me by 5u. this happens to be a kaldor-hicks improvement because you can pay me 5+ϵ, and i am now better off by ϵ while you are also better off by 25-ϵ. we have gained both pareto and allocative improvements through a k-h transfer.---the reason i mentioned it is because the conclusion that competitive markets are efficient comes from the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics, which briefly states that 1) any walrasian (competitive) equilibrium is pareto efficient, and 2) any pareto efficient point can be accomplished with a combination of endowment redistribution and letting the free market take over. as we can see from the donut example, we had *a* pareto-efficient outcome (5 donuts each), but not necessarily an allocatively efficient outcome (10 donuts to you). in a sense, the price mechanism can fail to generate max efficiency - we didn't include prices, but you can introduce prices, endowment ~~and asymmetry~~ (not needed) to demonstrate this. not all improvements can be k-h improvements. this is a more general statement about price not guaranteeing efficiency, not directly targeted at the taxi market.---in general, any imperfection in the market generates allocative inefficiency. this includes monopoly power, barriers to entry (such as cost or regulations), information asymmetry (where one party knows more than another) and so on. the taxi market here demonstrates all of these factors, which is why the price mechanism can fail to bring about ""efficiency"".one might wonder why, at the beginning, i said that a classical demand-supply leads to efficiency while here, i said that the price mechanism can fail in doing that. the gist of it is that the models are different - when markets are imperfect, one party, either supplier or consumer, has an incentive to deviate from the perfect equilibrium. for example, if i have the power to slash quantity and raise prices, i might do so. you can see such an illustration [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/monopoly-surpluses.svg/326px-monopoly-surpluses.svg.png), where the allocatively efficient point is where blue crosses red. if i do so, i lose the revenue from the bottom yellow triangle, and gain the upper blue square, a net gain for me. the top yellow triangle represents the consumers who were cut out by the price raise; so yellow = total loss. if i were to force the firm to produce at qc on the x-axis, they are forced to sacrifice the top blue square and gain the bottom yellow triangle, but consumers gain the top blue square and the top yellow* triangle, erasing all allocative inefficiency - but at cost to the firm! the price mechanism has generated a pareto efficient point, but we show that allocative improvements can still be made.---the truth, of course, is that transport economics is much more complex than that. but the rule that pricing may be flawed in flawed markets holds. that is not to say that the taxi market is inefficient, simply that there exists a strong potential for it to be. to fix the above, for example, the firm may charge different prices to different people (price discrimination). such is the case for area-based pricing, or student pricing, for example. in this case, the inefficiency is alleviated because everyone gets to use the service, but the benefits are skewed towards the producer/taxi firm.  then it becomes not a problem of efficiency, but of ""fairness"", which is much more subjective.even now, though, you might be able to think of a number of examples of abusing things like student price (reselling, scalping, buying more than you need...), which can re-introduce inefficiency.",Positive

kudos to the driver who tried to block the taxi and prevent it careering down an unconscious driver. well done!,Negative
comfort delgro wants to collect unpaid fair from passenger.,Positive
"nobody can say for sure what happened inside the cab unless there was an inward facing camera. maybe to the passenger, the driver looked as if he was acting 'crazy' when he passed out. the least he could do if he noticed something happening to the driver was to prevent the vehicle from moving any further? well but what do i know, i'm just an armchair critic.",Positive
"think since there's so many people who said the passenger should have done something: yeah, no, i don't blame the passenger in the slightest. i'd be freaked out too if i noticed my driver behaving erratically and my first thought would honestly to get myself and whoever's with me out of there asap. being a hero is tough, and i'm not one for that.",Positive

so the passenger didn’t get the driver any help?,Neutral
"and he does that with full knowledge that his car would also get hit. i think that’s what is most admirable, willing to sacrifice his car for the sake of others’",Positive
that’s not fare,Neutral
"i assume the passenger either panicked, or was unaware that the handle between the front seats, usually called the parking brake, is also referred to as the emergency brake.i wouldn't step out of a moving car, let alone into motorway traffic.",Negative
is it because he is,Neutral
"maybe he was also concerned for his own life, but i hope he did try to call paramedics or smth",Positive
fare enough,Neutral
"the taxi seems to be a newer version (hyundai i40), likely to be automatic transmission. it wouldnt have a handbrake down the middle, likely to have a footbrake instead. besides, it wont be very safe to engage the handbrake at those speeds (no abs, you could slide the car).honestly when the taxi started swerving he could have alerted the driver? or told the driver to just stop driving to seek help.",Positive
the taxi was moving pretty slowly when he got out though. i think you will step out of a slow moving car if the car has been swerving left and right and hitting the center barrier.,Positive
the driver blacked out so it's not like he could have just told him to stop driving.,Neutral
i think we think differently.  the first thing i would do is try to take control of the situation. what happens if the semi-conscious driver accelerates just as i step out?  ,Positive
proceed to taxi stand if u really need a taxi. most likely they removed the option cos taxi need to queue in the taxi queue at the terminals,Positive
"off topic, i stay in pasir ris. its phv all the way when i need to get to and from the airport. take taxi? uncle sure black face",Positive
about a month ago i tried to get grab at the airport and could not find drivers.,Neutral
"wait, you can specifically book a taxi with grab? i didn't even knew that. can someone explain why you'd specifically want a taxi and not just a car with a driver?",Neutral
"also with the airport surcharges, cabs won't want to take justgrab or grab taxi calls",Neutral
guess they did the math on riders with children and decided it was worth getting rid of the option to allocate more rides to cars (been reading about complaints of lack of pings on driver side),Positive
i don’t get it. the complaint is that riders are forced to book a car with a child seat?,Negative
why wouldn't you just get in the taxi line?,Neutral
in any case even if you can book a taxi you will have to pay:1) booking fee +2) airport surchage as stated in this lta notice: https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/public-transport/taxis%20and%20private%20hire%20cars/fares-and-payment-methods.htmlit would cost most than just queuing for a taxi,Positive

"i never realized until today when i arrived back at changi and wanted to book ahead for my departure to the city. first i thought they completely removed the ""standard taxi"" option form the car selection \(fyi \- it's not in the ""more vehicles"" option either\), but i just pulled out grab again being in the city this morning, and there it is the taxi option is back. never new it is removed as an option when booking from changi, you can test yourself by just entering any changi terminal in your grab app as ""departure"", wonder why, i can still pre\-book a taxi via the cdg app as usual..**edit:** why this matters \- anyone with an infant or kid will now have to lineup at the taxi stand and not have an option to pre\-book their ride as usual via grab, or has to choose the much more expensive option for ""grabfamily"" within the app, meaning families and parents with little kids have a huge disadvantage if they want to use grab departing changi",Negative
won't be surprised if it's an lta rule,Positive
so you didn't managed to grab one?,Neutral
"when justgrab/grabcar/grabshare is surging to hell and back i guess.nowadays it seems more like a remnant of the past, grab started out as grabtaxi, they rebranded to grab after they started adding grabcar, etc.",Positive
"man, i remember when booking taxis was the *only* thing grab (then called grabtaxi) did. it was basically a unified booking app for any taxi driver who chose to use it as a driver. you paid the driver the meter fare, no surge pricing but you have to deal with all the standard taxi surcharges.it was only after uber launched in singapore, if i recall correctly, that grab transitioned to hiring their own drivers under the grabcar service.",Positive
"for various reasons. i take standard taxi most of the time as taxi uncles generally know the roads better while normal grab drivers tend to follow gps which sometimes gives ridiculous long\-winded routes. after having travelled from jurong camp\-tampines once on a grab via pie\-kje\-bke\-sle\-tpe instead of the most common sense route of pie all the way, i've more or less sworn off normal grab cars unless i'm taking midnight transport home.",Positive
"taxis are allowed to have babies riding on parent's laps but grab cars are not. grab cars require booster seats or car seats for babies/young kids. if no such seats are available, they are not allowed to accept passengers with young children.",Positive
"taxis tend to be bigger cars, if you have 4 adults and order a normal grab and a honda jazz turns up, going to be squashed af. there's no option for a slightly larger car in grab.",Positive
"of course, you can choose “standard taxi” just like “just grab” and all other options, you would do that in exactly the mentioned case for example, when you have a little kid which isn’t allowed to ride in a normal car, or if you want to be sure you get a certain sized car and not a tiny polo or run down car (just grab)",Positive
that's exactly what i am thinking..,Positive
"no, having to book either a car with child seat or a taxi (which are excluded from the rules) is totally fine, and adheres to the local law.the complaint is that grab tries to profit from the rule, by excluding the option to book a taxi (its usually in your vehicle selection menu) from your choices, forcing you to book their much more expensive ""grabfamily"" option. tl;dr - as a family or parent you usually would book a taxi via grab as the prices are comparable (almost) with the ""just grab"" option, removing that, forces everyone on the ""grabfamily"" option which is much higher priced.",Negative
"you can use the priority queue at the taxi stand if you have infants, so you will go right to the front of the queue. even the standard queue typically moves quite fast.i usually feel it’s the immigration queue that is the bottleneck when bringing kids (since we can’t use the automated lane).",Positive
"> anyone with an infant or kid will now have to lineup at the taxi standit's really no big deal to line up at the taxi stand. from my experience, the queue usually moves fast. > i can still pre-book a taxi via the cdg app as usual..really? the comfort app [doesn't allow](https://i.imgur.com/xabvvn1.jpg) me to book taxis from changi airport.> much more expensive option for ""grabfamily"" within the app, meaning families and parents with little kids have a huge disadvantage if they want to use grab departing changilol there's really no need to exaggerate the price difference. grabfamily is just $2 more compared to justgrab, which imo is a reasonable price to pay for the extra child seat you get.",Positive
"i think you're using **much more expensive** very liberally there, considering it's only $2 more in your example. though having the standard taxi option would still be good.",Positive
you probably can get a cab faster than getting a phv vehicle at the airport by waiting in line,Neutral
"if 2 extra dollars is an issue, i would suggest taking the bus/mrt route.",Neutral
"seems like it's an airport rule. from grab's [website](https://help.grab.com/hc/en-sg/articles/115009704848-how-to-book-from-the-airport):> in compliance with airport regulations, taxi bookings services will be disabled at all changi airport terminals. other grab services are still available.this would also explain why you can't book a taxi from the airport even with comfort's own app.",Positive
or part of the approval for the uber merger :\),Neutral
when trump comes i wonder what he will use grab for.,Neutral
"depends when you left camp.  around 6-8pm?  i would take the grab route, it is longer but it is much faster when you take into account pie jams.  the grab route is generally the fastest even if it is inefficient in regards to length.",Positive
"depends on what time. peak hour, then ya i will go the long way around.",Negative
"ah, this makes sense then although this sounds like some legislative blind spot.",Negative
"so why not just get a regular taxi in the taxi queue? i mean is it just me or is this not that big of a deal because probably there are rules for the taxis to queue in the taxi queue?people need to chill and stop giving grab shit. if you don't want to use it, don't. personally i haven't experienced any price difference since the deal was announced.",Negative
got it.  suspicion confirmed:  would rather save a few dollars than ensure the safety of a child.,Positive
"true, yes, the priority queue at the taxis really works wonders, however there's a priority queue for families at immigration too, it doesn't change the fact that immigration is usually pretty slow, but it speeds up the process at least a little bit :)",Negative
"when i travel alone, i book the phv for pickup at the terminal when i am collecting my bags, worked out 20 out of 20 times, that when i exit the arrival hall, the phv is just about to arrive, plus it safes you the surcharge or a grumpy cab driver that was hoping to bring you to some hotel in the cbd, instead of something closerin the east.if you are with kids, you cant book phv anyways. so you will go with the taxi, and yes, the priority queue works well.",Neutral
guess as much. looks like op's angst is targeted at the wrong person/org,Negative
"yeah, doesnt make sense at all, and kind of gives taxis a card blanche, plus puts kids in danger, so i dont get it at all",Positive
> personally i haven't experienced any price difference since the deal was announced.you lucky lucky person you,Positive
$2 actually,Neutral
"hmmmm, what part of this did you not get:""no, having to book either a car with child seat or a taxi (which are excluded from the rules) is totally fine, and adheres to the local law.""lol",Positive
"from your lack of response, i take it that you admit you were bs-ing when you claimed the comfort app allows you to book taxis from the airport?",Neutral
"could be that i barely used grab before, i was always using uber, so maybe they don't have enough data on me to charge me different prices.",Neutral
i understand completely.  just because it’s excluded from the law doesn’t make it a good decision.,Positive
"lack of response... hmmmm.... wouldn’t that implicate i didn’t reply to you?also, please tell your boss we really want the “cancel” function while searching for a ride!",Positive
might be possible yes! stay out of the data collection otherwise your prices will go up too :),Neutral
lack of relevant response to my point about the comfort app. your irrelevant ad hominem attack doesn't count.,Positive
... and waiting times lower than 15mins for a ride would be great too (for your bosses that is),Positive
that video was in r/watchpeopledie,Neutral
finally. another idiot off the road,Negative
"huuu. so that is the taxi driver, and not the fast car driver, who got arrested ?? he doesn't seem to be the one who was going at a crazy speed here. what about the driver arriving at a junction at this crazy speed. this is the dangerous one.looks to be all wrong, as usual...",Negative
that sub is messed up,Neutral
only a million or so to go.,Neutral
"don't worry, he will be back after serving his sentence/paying fine/or after finishing suspension of his license. it is not they are going to ban him for life (which they should ban both drivers).",Positive
"it's really hard to put the blame on anyone, as a driver i can see myself in the position of either car. the only reason why he was arrested was because someone died. i see people doing similar shit every single day so...",Negative
"why would the other driver have slowed down if he has the right of way \(green light\)?  he is in fact driving at a normal speed \(about 60 km/h\), it may seem faster because the dash cam was stationary.",Positive
i know. some people even poke fun of the video there...,Positive
"in fact singapore have crazy driving rules. it's a no sense. but the speed and selfish is the base of this accident. if the man have been slow he would have time to brake, the choc would have been less rude. he could also have avoid others cars..in others countries logic, the faulty one, is the one who hit. that's all !",Negative
"you are crazy !go to europe. do that and you won't get your driver license, get an accident and you will be send to jail because slowing done at junction is a mandatory rule.stop thinking about your ass ! think to other people. there is no ""i'm in my right"", you will be convicted because of your crazy driving. o hope you stay in singapore and not come to europe make people in danger.",Negative
this idiotic thing of turning across a junction without checking properly is not a uniquely singaporean thing. this happens in many countries all over the world.,Negative
are you french?,Neutral
">in others countries logic, the faulty one, is the one who hit.if i step into oncoming traffic and got hit... is it not **my** fault?",Neutral
"this is a singapore subreddit.... i respect the rules and i agree about slowing down before a junction but you don't have to input your european rules here, maybe if im going over seas i would obviously ask bout the driving rules but in here shit is different, i think we undirstand where you're coming from but you're just being extra like me.",Negative
didn't see anything untoward in the clementi post on that sub though,Neutral
"so what ? downvote because you don't like my idea ?ah yes, of course. opposition is not welcome.you're not perfect. as we are. difficult to understand ?getting out of a country is a too much simple response, you can do better. i guess.but i can assure you that you won't go far in your life if you only think like this.",Positive
"most of the time. the idea i have learn is that you have to be master of your vehicle.and so, in this extreme case. it is irresponsible to go that fast at the junction. the taxi driver has done a fault by not checking correctly. but going fast at a junction, when you know that car can turn, is a huge error. mostly because the man driving the white cab didn't also think that it might have a car hidden behind. he arrived fast and have done the same mistake.""better give up your right and be alive rather than being in your right and dead"".edit : so what ? i get downvote for what ? you prefer to be in your right and be dead ? ok, i wasn't aware you prefered this. sorry about that.",Positive
"this is also a subreddit. and i'm giving my opinion. i still consider crazy to authorize vehicle to turn when it's not their traffic lights which are green. it took me time to understand singaporean logic.and that is also the reason why i will try to never have to conduct in this city.it's too dangerous.in one week i have seen 3 cars crash. and a man get killed by a taxi.i have seen driver rolling on the sidewalk.car graze people on the sidewalk.i never seen that in my life. something wrong in driving rules here, this is not normal to get so many accidents !",Negative
something is wrong with your countryedit : do link me the article im interested in knowing how there are many crashes.,Positive
"sorry i didn't manage to find an article.it was in serangoon area. one car crash with 3 cars involved, hopefully not any injured people. a motorcycle turned at last moment, one car brake and try to avoid it, the one behind failed to brake and avoid the car so it crash, and then a third car also failed to brake and avoid. 3 cars. it was around midnight and there were not so many cars at this time.looks like serangoon, a straight street with lot of cars is part of a lot of accidents. the man killed by the taxi in the area of boon keng, it was a street perpendicular to serangoon also. it's a straight street, and despite this, there is a lot of big accidents.but you should just look at the accident page of straight times, there are a lot of them : https://www.straitstimes.com/tags/accidents-traffic",Positive

i feel like taxis are more knowledgeable and less scummy about this because they've been around longer and don't really resort to such radical changes. they're more stable and constant and wouldn't pull any fast moves. when was the last time comfort did something fancy?all they do is just _be there_ .,Positive
"i mean, the way i look at it, you either have asshole comfort, or asshole comfort _and_ grab.for me, i just don't take taxis often. the biggest power consumers have against companies is taking your money elsewhere. i know singapore's public transport is iffy, but at least you're not enabling these scummy taxi companies.",Negative

"nah, uber has always been better than grab for me, from the app experience to how the handle support. but that's not the point, we want more competition, not less.",Positive
i don’t like the app and i hate the fact it tells drivers where i’m going. one major benefit of uber was the fact the driver either accepted the fare or not - they didn’t know where they were driving. this benefitted us greatly in singapore where taxi uncles pick and choose their fares - but grab allows their drivers to do this. a taxi service is useless unless they drive me where i want to go.,Negative
"you have more faith than me. companies want profit, if they didn't have to put in more to get the profits, they won't. they start giving out better service and promo codes because they want to stay in the game. if grab goes away, so do the promo codes. the service will get strained by higher volume and it will be the same all over again. that's my view anyway.",Positive
"they were scummy, which was why they were affected by uber/grab. now the tables are turned we will see what they are doing.",Neutral
"i find their effectively round-the-clock peak period surcharge pretty scummy. or how the meter ticks in 20 second chunks (iirc, correct me if i'm wrong), so if a taxi stops for like 5 seconds, it will still tick once, and 25 seconds will tick twice.remember, taxis were the original villains that we boycotted when ride hailing platforms came about, now we're going back to them?",Positive
"> i feel like taxis are more knowledgeable and less scummytaxi uncles are some of the least knowledgeable people on the roads of singapore. on average their driving is awful, their customer care is awful, and they couldn't give a fuck about their customers as they want to pick and choose which jobs they take. a lot of them also try and drive the longest route hoping that their passenger doesn't know better. uber solved this by placing a rating system - so when your uber uncle shows up and his cab stinks of smoke and farts, or his driving is like someone playing a bad computer game where the aim is to score points by repetitively accelerating/decelerating and wobbling the wheel then you can hand out a shit review and he won't get any more jobs. can't do that with the normal taxis.",Positive
"fair enough. unfortunately i have to take either taxis or phvs regularly, and often to ulu out-of-the-way places for work. and sometimes i need to get to those places pronto. and i don't own a car. i remember the bad old days when i had to head down to somewhere like tuas, and taxi drivers would suddenly have somewhere urgent to go upon learning of my destination. more competition is always good for consumers. those dinosaurs at comfort made a decent a booking app probably in large part due to the disruption by phv companies.",Positive
"i agree that the codes will go away, but codes are a privilege, not a staple. if you want to take a taxi, it is going to be expensive regardless. want low prices? try the mrt.and, with no codes, the service will not get strained, because people will go back to take public transport, like how it has always been.very appalling that people can view taxis as a permanent part of their life that they cannot shake. we've lived so long without all these ride hailing nonsense, but somehow they've twisted our arms and made us rely on them. soon as we stop relying on them, they will lose their power and subsequently their big profit margins.sure, we will have lesser convenience, but again, it was a privilege from the very start, not a staple.",Positive
"i agree, the initial competiton was fantastic.in recent times, though, change has slowed, uber is gone, grab became complacent, comfort is now being aggressive just to get to the summit. once they get there, who knows what they'll do next?",Positive
"i guess the question is that we just need better competitors. grab isn't going to keep comfort on their heels for long. given enough time, grab's decine will get worse and comfort will reign again.",Positive
"competition is good, but it's hard to withold competition in small markets in singapore. see, uber absconded. you can't have big companies in singapore, sadly, because the market is just absolutely tiny when you compare it to other cities abroad. especially when you're talking about bespoke services and on top of that you have to consider how cheapo we are. so when you take your abyssmal profit margin, less discounts offered, it's just not worth investing here.",Positive
"i didn't say anything about taxi being the main mode of transport. there will be situations where you don't mind paying for a taxi, or you have to take a taxi. right now those demands are be split between grab and taxis. if grabs goes away, the taxi companies will take all the customers. as for the codes, they'll be around for a long time if there were competition. privilege or not, competition will always result in better and fairer pricing. we don't want a comcast situation, where they can do whatever the fuck they want and you have to suck it up and pay exorbitant prices. of course we should all plan our time better and avoid taking a cab. cabs are a luxury. but if prices can reach the sweet spot where it's low enough for commuters and companies are still turning a profit. why not?",Positive
"yes, i agree that some people have reasons for taxis, but a lot of people are just taking it for the hell of it. we will not have a comcast situation, because gahmen will handhold us. and a comcast-esque company will have little to profit from cheating such a small market.competition is hard to obtain in singapore. you've got a tiny market, divvied up two ways, and then even further trivialised by discounts you have to give. with such a bespoke service, it's kind of difficult to turn a healthy profit margin worth your efforts, isn't it? keep in mind these companies are big ones. like uber. they are looking at the big numbers, not the small ones. prices cannot hit the sweet spot hence. if we have more people, than the discounts will be worth it if overall the company gets a big profit, but it's just not gonna work.",Positive
"hence i said you have more faith in them then me. i don't know if the government will step in and prevent a comcast situation. if it isn't worth it for big companies to invest into our market, it gives the chance for smaller companies to grow. the market will balance itself if the rules are fair and there is a demand. before uber and grab came in and changed the market, i couldn't think of a way to improve the taxi asshole situation. yet someone did it and our lives are improved. i hope grab doesn't exit our market. i hope they innovate and change constantly. or maybe a new company rise from the ashes of uber.",Positive
"the government will. if they don't, be hella surprised. (or maybe temasek holdings has a hand in the supposrd comcast's pants)smaller companies like what? ryde was a small company. look how it fared. small companies can't pull of the technological challenge of running a digital ride hailing platform. you need a lot of capital to start, or be the first one there. so, i guess we have to wait for some genius to find an innovative and groundbreaking way to hail rides.i also hope grab innovates, but their announcements are really silly. their new grab and go thing? what? when are they going to do something about their first line of business? if they continue dicking around, they'll stop being a threatening competition and comfort will go back to their old ways.",Positive
"it was back in ns and this was my first time booking out. my friends and i shared a cab since we all lived in the east. coincidentally we're all malay.  we got this malay abang mat rock driver who were playing great old malay rock tunes, the type you'd find at malay weddings back in the 90's and 2000's.  so we hit it off pretty well, then he asked if we all smoked. he passed us all cigarettes, rolled down the windows and literally all of us started puffing in his cab on the expressway.  didn't charge extra either. he was just showing his appreciation towards us in his own way. never had a ride like that ever since.",Positive
"was on a gojek a couple of weeks, on my way home when i got on the car, the driver didn’t speak a single word, nor did he even respond when i told him to take a different route.initially i thought the driver was an ass for not responding or simply giving a nod to acknowledge whatever i’ve said. however it was at the last traffic light before my destination when i decided to go by a different approach and maybe try to speak a different ‘language’ so i turned to him and tried to sign to “are you deaf” and turns out the driver responded with a “yes”. proceeded to sign out “hi, my name is ushimoo, nice to meet you, what is your name?” man you should have seen the twinkle in his eyes as he smiled from ear to ear, when he found out i too, understood sign language. 100% pure wholesomeness and goodness‘twas was a good day, when i made a driver’s trip memorable :)",Positive
"i was leaving pasir ris saf ferry terminal at around 9pm because i ooced and had to report to a new camp the next morning at 8am. i had to carry my duffel bag + field pack + everything else stuffed in assault pack and it was tiring enough walking out of tekong with all that while being sick.i live in the west but planned to just take bus and mrt home even if it takes 2 hours. on the walk towards the bus stop, my duffel bag toppled over and everything was going horribly wrong. that's when a taxi happen to pass by and i decided screw it to just take the taxi.the taxi uncle laughed at me when he heard i was planning to take bus. anyway, he kept talking throughout the trip and taught me how to keng and make full use of the free medical care ns provides.his advice was kind of worthless but it was refreshing at that time hearing a different perspective after being trapped on tekong for weeks.",Positive
i took a taxi home one time after supper. can’t remember how the conversation started but the cool indian uncle told me that he used to be in the police force. then i mentioned so was my late dad too. he asked if i had a photo of my dad and when i showed him turns out he recognised my dad. my dad was a few years his senior. it was like a really weird but heartwarming what are the odds kinda feeling!,Negative
"my grabcar was stuck in a major jam (almost 1h on the pie) on the way to a film a minor event where the then-president tony tan was scheduled to attend. turns out the president’s motorcade was stuck in the same jam (?!) and arrived just a minute before i did. the rest of my crew was already on-site, so they managed to capture the arrival.but that’s not the most interesting part of the ride. i actually cancelled the grabcar earlier because the app showed that the guy was really far away, but he pulled up almost immediately after i cancelled. still took the ride though, and paid him in cash later.after the event ended, i realised that in my frenzy, i had left my wallet in the grabcar! called grab support and found out that the driver had already gone home. about ten minutes later the driver called and said he’d check his car and get back to me.the driver actually drove down to me later (he said it was no problem, nearby) and returned my wallet with everything intact. i offered him a small token but he didn’t want to take it.it’s been more than three years already but mr max, if you happen to read this you’re a good man!",Positive

"i overslept and looked like i was going to miss my driving lesson one morning, so i hailed a cab instead of a bus, hoping to make it on time. the cab driver was a nice malay guy with whom i had a casual conversation with, till he realised i was rushing to the driving centre. he attempted to speed up, albeit safely, to reach as fast as possible but at one traffic light, he looked at me from head to toe through his rear view mirror and asked me if driving centres allowed students to take their lessons while being in shorts. (after the ride i realised i would've been able to but in all the hullabaloo, i was stressed!) so now, my eyes were darting around his car and i was thinking if i could possibly make the timing for my lesson and get a pair of pants! the memorable part comes now, as the driver looks at me, tells me to look behind the head rest and says that i can take his pair of pants for the lesson. he ensured it was clean and all because he uses it for prayers. my initial reaction was ""how am i supposed to give this back to you??"" to which he responded with a ""it's alright"" as if to say my predicament was more important at this moment. so i assuredly took the pants, wore it over my shorts while in his car, and when for my lesson.i didn't have this guy's name, number, car plate number or any type of identification at all! i've never seen nor heard from this driver again but i really hope that there are others like him out there, who would help their passengers out in the spur of the moment, even though they know they'll probably not get any recognition for it. if somewhere, somehow you are reading this though my cab driver, thank you very much for your spontaneity on the day and please do know that you can go for driving lessons in shorts! haha",Positive

"mentioned to my grab driver a few saturdays ago that he was driving me to watch the ndp practice, and he went on to tell me about his 30-year career with the army, and how he was personally involved in 10 national day parades, which was pretty awesome for a relative newbie to singapore to hear. funnily enough, he also insisted i sounded '100% singaporean', and initially refused to believe i wasn't from here. also got a recommendation for excellent pandan tea at a small shop near where i live. definitely one of the more memorable rides so far.another time, the uncle driving me home from the airport had some pretty fascinating stories to share from his pre-retirement life as an antiques dealer. he now drives a few hours a week, goes golfing with his friends, and showcases pieces from his antiques collection at galleries every now and then. sweet life!there have actually been plenty more (maybe i just get an unfair share of interesting grab/gojek drivers?) but these two were the most memorable. always enjoy taking cab rides in singapore!",Positive
"one grab driver told me that sci-fiction (aliens, star wars etc) are actually true stories but packaged as fiction cos the gahmen doesn’t want us to believe them this was at 3am after a gruelling day at work so i didn’t have the energy to engage. the wtf moment stayed in my head though",Negative
"2 trips come to mind.in the dying days of uber, i was taking one driven by an uncle, clearly new to the ride-hailing service system (<3 stars). he pulled up in a beat-up car and i was like, ""uh ok, as long as it gets me home right"". but then when i tried to open the car door, some rubber part that holds the door to the car literally came off. he looked at me like it was no big deal and so i hopped on like an idiot lmaohe was inexperienced with the gps and had to stop at the side of the road just to figure out where we were going, and the trip ended up being 20 mins longer than the usual ride. i was so nervous about falling out of the car that i held on to my seatbelt the entire time. when i alighted i felt pretty bad for him, he didn't seem like a bad guy and he was a careful driver, but i couldn't bring myself to rate him any more than 4 stars.-the second ride was on grabhitch. i believe i'm not the only one to come across eccentric drivers on hitch as they seem so prevalent, whatwith the lack of screening and commitment they have to grab. this guy was well-dressed, maybe mid-30s, and i asked him to pick me up from my poly. he said he couldn't find me, well that's understandable as these school compounds often have confusing layouts. so he instructed me to wait for him at a bus stop outside my poly which was a sweaty 10min walk from where i was. when he finally found me and i boarded, he glanced at me from his rear-view mirror and told me condescendingly, ""you know you're supposed to sit in front beside me in grabhitch? we're not serving you you know, you're just taking a ride with us on the way to our destination."" and i stared back at him not knowing what to do. the car's already moved. should i be asking him to stop in the middle of the road for me to change my seating to somewhere where it is clearly uncomfortable for both of us? he then smiled and said he was joking.then he proceeded to tell me about his racist ideologies. ""it's not that i want to be racist, but i don't pick up indian riders. if their name is english but later when i see they're indian down the road, i'll just cancel the ride."" mind you, he was telling me with such an unearned, proud tone it just baffled me. he said more about malay riders, female drivers, etcetc i felt lowkey threatened being in the car with him. boy have i never been so glad to alight from a car.",Positive
"took a taxi from geylang back home after having dinner with friends. taxi uncle thought i’m a prostitute (wtf) and proceeded to flirt and offer me some deal. asked me to have dinner with him and he’ll absorb my taxi fare after telling him sorry i don’t have small change, only $50 note. nani the fuck. i told him he can have the change instead.     took a taxi back home from clarke quay after clubbing, didn’t have cash so told the driver to stop me at the atm machine near my place. came back to pass him the cash after withdrawing money and in return he gave me his number and told me to text him. ??????      took a taxi home after work (school holiday job) and the throughout the whole trip the driver came commenting on my lip labret and how sexy it made me lips look. ?????? eeeeew.",Positive

"most of my grab rides involve a lot of idle chatter but one conversation left an indelible impression. this took place some time ago, back when uber was still around. i booked a ride to hougang around 7ish one morning and a lady driver accepted my booking.since it was the weekend, i was curious why she’s already up and about so early, so i asked her. turns out she’s a single mom and she drives an average of 12 to 15 hours a day (with little breaks in between) so she can make enough to raise her son. her mother cares for her boy when she’s working, hence i am assuming she needs to cover her mother’s expenses too. that’s a huge responsibility to shoulder for one person.i told her that what she’s doing is truly commendable, but she needs to take care of her health too. driving such long hours on the road is no joke. besides, fatigue can lead to accidents too. i also learnt that she tends to skip meals when she receives back-to-back bookings on a stretch.before i alighted, i told her that she might be able to make a small fortune if she persists at this rate, but the long-term health risks are hardly worth it. she should also spend more time with her kid before his childhood is forever lost in time.experiences like these remind me that every single driver has a story to tell, good or bad. some drive to pass time, some do it to get by, some do it to raise a family.",Positive

"want to get back home at the end of the day in a levitating hovercraft?flying vehicles may just be a part of singapore's transport network in the near future; in fact, the ministry of transport says that you can ""bet your money"" on it.it has already taken initial steps to make it happen. the ministry's top official has told the business times that it is in talks with some companies to start trials on drones that can carry passengers.but human-carrying drones are not the only newfangled modes of transport to come to singapore down the road - on-demand buses that ply dynamic routes may soon feature in singapore's public bus network as well.these ideas were unveiled on wednesday at the second business times leaders' forum, where the ministry gave an idea of its vision for urban mobility in 2030 singapore.speaking to more than 400 participants, permanent secretary pang kin keong listed some of the trends and technologies his ministry is looking at for singapore's future transportation mix.noting that the availability and affordability of data and the rise of artificial intelligence are already upending the transport sector globally, mr pang stressed, however, that singapore's transport industry is up against land and manpower constraints.these constraints and trends will result in a different transport landscape for singapore by 2030, although trains will still continue to be the core of singapore's public transport system, he said.by 2030, there will be a rich and growing range of urban-mobility means.thus, rather than owning a mode of transport, it may be more sensible to pay for different mobility services tailored for different kinds of journeys. mr pang said that it may thus be possible to ride in a driverless pod to work, cycle to the gym after work, and then take an aerial taxi home.""there is going to be a significant shift in the public mindset from one of ownership of transport assets - which is the mindset today - to one of procurement of transport services as and when you need them.""the convergence of land and air mobility can be a mobility option, he added, as he showcased images of three human-carrying drones that have already been prototyped.they are the hoversurf scorpion by a russian startup, the volocopter vc200 from german company e-volo, and the ehang 184 autonomous aerial vehicle from china. dubai is already planning to fly the ehang 184 as an aerial taxi as early as july.""in 2030, you bet your money that aerial transport will also be a means of urban mobility,"" he said, but did not disclose further details beyond the ministry being in talks with some companies about putting human-carrying drones through tests.while the contours of aerial transport in singapore's network may still be hazy for now, a new form of service may take shape sooner.mr pang said in his presentation that singapore is looking at on-demand public bus services for areas with, and during hours of low ridership. this means that buses will ply low-ridership routes that are dynamic and responsive to riders' real-time demand during off-peak hours.this can eliminate the problem of empty spaces on buses, which is a ""terrible waste"" of taxpayers' and commuters' money, he said.mr pang told bt that the ministry is still developing the concept, ""but probably will share something later this year"".the transport ministry is also stepping up its efforts to push for driverless buses. it has signed a partnership agreement with a party to build and put such buses through a trial, and will be signing another agreement quite soon, he said.",Negative

"if it does both it is less efficient. a quad will be louder than a heli as your 4 props will be spinning at a faster rate. since your props are spinning faster you'll be consuming more energy than a heli to stay up. only advantage of a quad to a heli is in terms of safety, with 4 rotors instead of 1 main rotor, and possibly better protection from/for the rotors. unless there is some way to muffle the noise, i don't see it becoming more viable than a heli.",Positive
and yet we have the ever growing airline industry.it's foolish to dismiss any technology prematurely. ,Neutral

there are extremely simple solutions. don't just think of it from an engineering pov.,Negative
"there is a reason why airports are located as far away as possible from residential areas. they've not solved the noise problem yet. it isn't about dismissing technology, it is about technology that is being used in the wrong areas. helicopter taxis would be a thing before quads get there, simply because it is a less noisy, more efficient and more mature technology.",Positive
planes don't fly within 500 feet of your neighbourhood either.,Positive
"how heavy did you think wagons are? buggies start at about 400kg, and go up to 1-2 tons for the very large and ornate carriages. they reason why cars are more powerful is that they do move faster and go longer than horses do.in comparison, the rolling resistance coefficient of a car is about 0.01 to 0.015. ie, getting the car to move is 1% to 1.5% of overcoming gravity. a flying taxi isn't going to be 1-2 tons either, i bet.",Positive
"i know, takeoff/landing points away from residential areas. good for large countries with lots of area, but in singapore, you have very few areas for takeoff/landing and flight paths that would not be going over residential areas, meaning that flights would be pretty restricted to certain routes. economic feasibility then becomes the next question.",Positive

"flight paths are not linear points on a map :) they are 3 dimensional paths. we have a lot of experience managing flight paths from commercial aviation, something similar could be adopted. also, consider potential clientele and prospective routes and destinations. the idea is actually very feasible in singapore as long as there is demand for it.",Negative
"yup, i know that. i'm working on a startup that is focused on a drone management system and already we run into the issues of permitted flight paths for small delivery drones. if you are talking about one's big enough for people it puts an even greater limit on the paths. it definitely is doable from an engineering standpoint, but from a legislative standpoint is another thing.",Positive

and they hire the driver (although $1600 seems low).a different business model compared to the other taxi companies and grab.,Negative
"more taxi operators do not mean more taxi or convenience to the customers. when grab/uber enter the market, a large fleet of cd taxi is parked unused in a carpark. reason being cd drivers switched to drive for grab/uber. doesn't mean there's more people becoming taxi drivers.",Positive
"even that, more taxi operators don't add any inconvenience to the customer unlike the e payment market.",Positive
"hence my question is it necessary. actually it does add inconvenience to customers but i dare say most of us don't care. one example. do you know if you take a taxi from tenah merah ferry terminal, you will be charged $3 more for (if i remember correctly) silvercab, smrt and prime? while cd/citycab doesn't charge.",Positive
``` most of us don't care``` then there is no inconvenience caused. ``` is it necessary```i argue no if they are using the same business model from other taxi operators. but they [hire their driver](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/range-of-driver-hiring-options-should-be-offered-national-taxi-a-7603198) and they are using an electric car. so thus my answer of letting the free market(both drivers and consumers) to decide.,Positive
traffic jams probably mean they can't make as many trips though.,Positive
"according to a few taxi drivers i spoke to, taxi drivers used to hate driving in the rain because of the risk of accidents. of course that just exacerbated the supply-demand problem during rainy periods.i don't necessarily think they're happier, but the price per ride probably makes it more palatable for them (and turns off potential customers who might have otherwise tried to take a taxi)",Negative

"by right and according to lta rules, they're not supposed to pick and choose fares. by left, it's become an acceptable practice among them, which i why i feel absolutely no sympathy for the same taxi drivers who complain about grab and uber cutting into their earnings.in singapore, it's not about where you want to go, it's about where the *taxi drivers* want to go, and that's insanely fucked up.",Negative

"my understanding is largely due to the changing shift issue as they don't want to be late for handover. there are bad eggs around who pick and choose though. there are also places which the taxi drivers know that if they go, they won't get paid for sometime before their next fare (eg lim chu kang cemetery, neo tiew area)basic problem is their rental is way too high.",Negative

"hm that's weird, that only happens to me when they're changing shifts",Neutral
probably because they are ending or changing shift when you hailed the taxi. so the reason why taxi uncle may reject you if you are going woodlands but he is going tampines. think of the fuel cost he has to incur if he is going to ferry you. meaning taxi uncle will only drive you to the place you are going if it is along his route to change/end his shift.,Neutral

the worst part is when they pause to think while there are plenty of taxis driving past. fuck.,Negative
that was my thinking.,Neutral
"it cuts both ways though. with uber, you risk the driver getting you in the car and then trying to kick you out once he figures out where you're going (this has happened to me with uber in bali and lyft in the sf bay area, never in sg). with grab, the driver knows where you're going ahead of time, but he may decline the ride in the first place causing the app to not pair you with a driver.",Positive

"i mean, i get that and i see the taxi uncles putting up the shift change sign on their car, which is fine. however, i was under the impression that if they come up to a taxi queue or pull over for someone, it is against the law for them to simply drive off if they don’t want to go to your destination. if that happens all the time, people will be more likely to buy a car and avoid the hassles- according to what i have read.",Positive

"really? i honestly thought it was against the law. if it isn’t, then i will definitely start booking with uber or grab. i try to use taxis because these people work so hard, but i hate waiting for a long time and then having the uncle drive off because they don’t want to go to my destination.",Negative

my personal experience - taxi drivers tend to drive faster but have a higher chance to cause me to have headaches or carsick by the way they drive. private hire cars are more chillax and i find it even better when they are just doing it for extra cash on the side - less stress and pressure on the job means safer and more enjoyable rides.but my experience may differ from the rest.,Positive
"(most) grab drivers appear to have been trained in treating passengers like passengers which means unless you speak to them, they're typically quiet and drive carefully. if you do speak to them about their life etc, they are also quite cheery in sharing and do not talk about sensitive, polarizing topics like race/religion/politics. taxi drivers, especially older men, tend to talk down to me (young female here) about life, telling me to do a degree as though my life depended on it, how and when to get married, how and when to have babies, attitudes about foreigners and singaporeans of other races, why the government sucks. i've tried popping my headphones in, and all that does is:\*removes headphones ""sorry, what did you say?"" whenever the taxi driver would say anything, because it might be pertinent to the actual ride like ""which exit to turn"" etc.perhaps i am averse to confrontations. i don't want to accidentally offend someone i'm actually paying money to drive me to my destination. driving is another factor. maybe it's because grab drivers are actually rated by passengers... i find that typically, the driving is pretty decent and there's nothing to complain about. taxi drivers on the other hand get pissed off every 2 minutes, and drive like they're late to the airport. i've had to, on more than one occasion, tell the taxi driver that i am not in a rush for time and casually ""the most important thing is safety"".",Positive
pros about grab to me is that you can see the price that you’re going to pay. so you don’t have to worry about the driver cheating you or if there’s a traffic jam. also they can pick you up at your carpark or places where there isnt a lot of taxis. don’t have to go to the main road to find one. i don’t really see any cons of using grab except for them surge prices. maybe kidnapping but even taxi drivers can do that. cons about taxi is that a lot of them are choosy. sometimes i hail a taxi & they just ignore. & also they will ask you where you wanna go to see whether they are willing to drive or not. one time i couldn’t get a grab & hailed for a taxi instead. it was the morning peak period & he dropped me like 7 blocks away from my house just so he can go to his next booking without going through the roads where there’s jam.,Positive
"the reason why i dont use taxi as often is because in most cases for me they are grumpy and if you take a short distance journey they will show attitude. they also sometimes take the longer route to earn more.of course people will say those are black horses, but yeah i encounter quite a fair bit of these cases so it applies to me.",Positive
"well, this is just my personal opinion. but when i take a cab back from my gf place to my place(west side to east side), the private hire cars can somehow get lost despite having a google map to follow. so, what should be a 25 min journey ends up being a 45 min detour. at that point i might as well just take the mrt home and save my self the money.",Neutral

"i personally prefer taking taxis. before phvs, i used to hate taking taxis as i found their drivers reckless. but after a couple of harrowing experiences on phvs, suddenly taxi drivers feel like angels compared to phv drivers. a lot of phv drivers are young, have a driving license but hardly drive as they usually don't own a car. as a result, they are usually a lot less experienced compared to taxi drivers. they are usually hopeless without the gps and it's not uncommon for them to miss turns even when following the gps.",Negative

"i'm currently a full-time grab driver (not that i care what you use or don't use, but i'm in a position to see more of how the system itself works than most people). you misunderstand how the the taxis and grab systems work.... if anything, the taxi drivers are more of a risk for bad driving due to fatigue.  first off, grab drivers all have to have a license as well. eight hours in a classroom, two hours taking tests. so scratch out your third sentence. secondly, to get that license you have to have a driver's license for two years, and last i heard grab required that you'd been actually driving for two years. so it's not like there's much of a ""new driver"" problem, anyone with that red triangle on their car isn't allowed to drive private hire.&#x200b;finally, and this is really the big one, the taxi system forces taxi drivers to work much longer hours, under harsher conditions, than grab drivers. which is where the fatigue thing really comes in, as fatigue makes for bad driving. why does it work out that way? it's all about the business model. the taxi companies rent for a really high daily price, because that's how they make money. while grab makes their money off of commission. what this means is that, if you want to drive a taxi, you have to commit to a year minimum of driving sixty hours plus a week. grab has no minimum requirements. and to make matters worse, the taxi drivers are rather more likely to be sharing their vehicle with a second driver (so they can split that onerous rental cost), which means the drivers are working ten to twelve hour shifts. with grab it's common for drivers to around four hours in the morning, take the mid-day off, and then work five to seven hours in the evening. plenty of rest, breaks, etc. and grab part time drivers are simply not driving as much, which makes them overall better drivers even if they're working as many hours. doing a lot of driving is its own unique sort of brain fog.  boils down to taxi drivers have to work a crapton, they get more fatigued, they are more likely to drive poorly. also, more likely to be older uncles nearing retirement, which is where i think you get some of the rude behavior from. cranky old dudes be cranky.",Positive
"when i use such transport options, it will be taxi over phv. comfort over city cab. i won't take the red, silver or the green taxis. comfort drivers are more professional. they greet ""hello sir, where would you like to go?"" phv goes ""eh brother, you going botanic garden ah. no problem one lah."" some phv drivers are also real estate or insurance agents. always want to engage me in some sort of real estate deal by offering to bring me to see some houses. i also noticed that phv drivers like to keep driving forward for e.g. force themselves to merge lane even though the incoming car on the intended merged lane is coming on fast and furious. most taxi drivers would wait until the lane clears up. the most important difference is this willingness to wait. wait to turn into main road. wait for lane to be clear before clearing. wait for pedestrians to fully cross the road before turning into the lane. wait for sufficient space between cars in the next lane before merging over. sounds very ah pek, but i feel safe that way. then again, it could be the policy or culture that caused this. once i took phv and to be safe, i chose premium car. the screen said 5 mins. the driver texted me. ""bro, i will be there in 4 mins. bro, i'm coming in 3mins. bro, i'm reaching soon ok, please wait."" i'm like why he is over reacting for this 5 mins. when he came, i told him, bro 5 mins is alright no need to gan cheong especially when it is raining. he said,""bro u dunno one lah, heng u wait for me. some people even cannot wait for 5 mins so before i reach there, they gone already. especially the girls, bro..."" that's driving to pick up passenger, it will be another set of issue for travelling from pick up point to destination...",Neutral

of singapore female undergraduate whom he was ferrying following an accident in clementi road.> yap kok hua, 55, pleaded guilty to one count each of negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide and a negligent act causing grievous injury for the accident on 19 april last year. one count of causing injury through a negligent act and one of failing to ensure his passengers wore seatbelts were taken into consideration for his sentencing.> just prior to the accident, yap was about to turn at a junction at commonwealth avenue west and clementi road. he had attempted to make a right turn into clementi road despite seeing a car coming at a high speed towards him in the opposite direction.> nus undergraduate kathy ong kai ting was seated at the rear left of yap's taxi along with two other men, ting jun heng, who was beside her, and lim jin jie, who was at the rear right of the taxi.> another man, zon lim thou jung, was seated at the front passenger seat of the taxi. the three men were 22 years old.> the group was heading back to a nus residential college, tembusu college, when they were involved in the accident.> video footage of the accident last year made its rounds online.> the court heard that on the night of 19 april last year, yap picked up the four passengers from clementi mall. yap did not ensure that his rear passengers were wearing their seat-belts before moving off.> yap then drove along commonwealth avenue west towards commonwealth avenue on the rightmost lane. upon reaching the signalised cross junction of commonwealth avenue west by clementi road, yap stopped at the red traffic light. when the traffic light signal turned green, but before the green right turn arrow lit up, yap drove into the right turn pocket.> he stopped and checked for vehicles coming from the opposite direction. even though he saw a car coming towards him from the opposite direction at a high speed, he decided to do a right turn.> the 21-year-old car driver, ng li ning, who had the right of way, was unable to avoid the taxi and the two vehicles collided. a health sciences authority report later found that ng was travelling at a speed of 92 kmh to 97 kmh on a road with a speed limit of 70kmh. the same report also found that had ng's car been travelling within the speed limit, a collision would likely have been avoidable.> both cars spun and were severely damaged, said deputy public prosecutor timotheus koh. the taxi also hit another car which was stationary at the signalised junction.> all the passengers were conveyed to national university hospital where ong was pronounced dead at 10.25pm.> zon lim suffered from multiple facial lacerations, bruises and glass in his wounds.> lim jin jie received bruises and a fracture to his spine.> ting had a traumatic brain injury, and became vegetative initially but his condition has since improved. he suffered multiple injuries to his ribs, lung, left kidney and pelvic bone, and was dependent on a ventilator. he is still undergoing rehabilitation.> dpp koh sought eight weeks' jail for yap and a disqualification from driving for five years.> the accident claimed ong’s life and inflicted serious lasting injuries to three others, said the prosecutor. the accused was “aware of the danger approaching but decided to run the risk anyway”, he added.> yap was fined for several traffic offences up to 2016, including failing to conform to red light signal on three occasions, careless driving and speeding, according to the prosecutor.> josephus tan, yap’s lawyer, asked for six weeks' jail but agreed with the prosecution on the disqualification period.> the lawyer from invictus law pointed out that tan had first checked for oncoming traffic.> ""this is in stark contrast to the typical dangerous driving or even careless driving cases whereby the offender simply proceeds to drive through the junction without a single stop whatsoever,"" said tan.> referring to the hsa report, tan pointed out that the accident might have been avoidable if ng had been travelling within the speed limit.> yahoo news singapore understands that action will be taken against ng.> for a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, yap could be jailed up to two years, fined or both. for causing grievous hurt through a negligent act he faces jail of up to two years, or a maximum $5,000 fine, or both.> related

"> #last of compressed natural gas taxis scrapped; cng cars' days also numbered> singapore - compressed natural gas (cng) taxis have come to the end of the road, after blazing a trail which fizzled as quickly as it started.> the last cng taxi, belonging to trans-cab, was scrapped late last month, marking the end of efforts to encourage cabbies - who clock three to seven times the distance of the average motorist -to opt for the cleaner fuel.> trans-cab managing director teo kiang ang attributed the demise of cng cabs to several factors, including restrictions imposed on the transportation and storage of cng that have made the setting up of new stations onerous.> mr ang also admitted that cng cabs tended to have more technical glitches, and cabbies disliked having access to only three refuelling stations.> trans-cab was a strong supporter of cng. mr ang opened the world&apos;s biggest cng refuelling station near jurong east in 2009. he has applied for a change of use for his 7,066 sq m station site in old toh tuck road, but has ruled out converting it into a petrol station.> asian clean fuels association director clarence woo said cng is a cleaner fuel compared to diesel or petrol, but without subsidies, it is not viable.> ""with the limited number of refuelling stations, cabbies will not want to inconvenience themselves unless the cost is lucrative,"" he said. ""moreover, a cng car requires space for the cng tank, which doesn&apos;t help especially for the cab driver who has to transport passengers with luggages.""> at the height in 2011, there were 2,836 cng cabs here, making up 10.5 per cent of the taxi population. the number dwindled to around 1,000 in 2016, and by the end of last year, all were gone.> but cabbies are not the only ones abandoning cng. according to land transport authority figures, the cng car population stood at around 1,000 by the end of last year - less than half the peak population of 2,706 in 2010.> even bus operators have moved away from gas - with the number of cng buses plunging to 13 as at the end of last year, from a peak of 44 in 2010.> nanyang business school&apos;s adjunct associate professor zafar momin attributed the waning interest in cng cabs also to economic reasons.> ""the number of cng taxis and cng private vehicles rose quickly when greener alternative engines started gaining traction and their purchases were incentivised by the attractive green vehicle rebate,"" he said.> ""with the introduction of the carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme in 2013, the relative attractiveness of buying a cng vehicle diminished. in addition, the inconvenience of refuelling cng at relatively few locations and the lack of any operating cost advantage versus diesel fuel made choosing the cng option completely unattractive.""> mr momin added that the recent spate of cng vehicle fires ""put a nail in the coffin"".> he noted, however, that cng will continue to be a viable alternative fuel in other countries, ""especially where cng commands a significant cost advantage compared to diesel"".> [source](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/last-of-compressed-natural-gas-taxis-scrapped-cng-cars-days-also-numbered)---v4.0 | [github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [readme/changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/readme.md) | summon me: `/u/rsg-retrivr summon`",Positive

"there is a significant advantage to going electric that you have omitted: eliminating tailpipe emissions. tailpipes emit particulates that are increasingly linked to vascular and neurological disorders. people are exposed to these while driving, while waiting for the bus, and simply walking down the street. for busy streets, you must travel some distance away from the road before pollution recedes to background levels. true indeed that you want to clean the electric grid at the same time, but singapore's is based on oil and natural gas, so it could be worse (coal).",Positive
"you are absolutely right, but a lot of singaporeans fail to understand the fact electricity is in fact generated by fossil fuel sources (95% natural gas, https://www.ema.gov.sg/piped_natural_gas_and_liquefied_natural_gas.aspx) and they some how think that by using electricity,  fossil fuels will be obsoleted lol. at the end of the day, our lack of alternative power sources (nuclear plant, dams, etc) still makes it the same more or less, with the difference only in whether you burn fossil fuels yourself in your personal vehicle, or govt burns it for you in their plants and then supplying it to you through extensive network we need to build (incurring a huge cost without any practical returns to cover).",Positive

"if you can't beat them, join them. that is exactly what taxi giant comfortdelgro is doing with a planned roll-out of non-metered fares.  the cab operator may also open its taxi-booking app to private-hire drivers.  the straits times understands that comfortdelgro, which controls 60 per cent of singapore's 20,000-strong taxi fleet, will soon introduce dynamic pricing - made popular by private-hire operators such as grab and gojek.  unlike metered fares, which are transparent and regulated, dynamic fares fluctuate according to demand. on a rainy saturday evening, for instance, a $10 ride could spiral to $50.  during a major rail breakdown, the same ride could exceed $100. sources said comfortdelgro will offer this fare option through its phone app, alongside regular metered fares. when contacted, comfortdelgro spokesman tammy tan said: ""we are always looking at ways to cater to different commuter and driver needs.""  the transport giant has been looking to enter the private-hire space since its failed tie-up with uber last year, when the american ride-hailing firm decided to pull out of south-east asia.  with the taxi business battered by private-hire players - average daily taxi trips have shrunk by nearly one-third since grab entered singapore in 2013 - cab operators are looking at ways to claw back their market share.  with its shift, comfortdelgro is expected to eventually open its cab-booking app to private-hire drivers, numbering about 46,500.  observers reckon comfortdelgro will not only be able to turn the tide with this move, but it stands to grow a new revenue stream from ride hailing too. there are close to 100,000 licensed taxi drivers in singapore, but fewer than half of them are said to be active.  in a report last month, equities research house macquarie said that it was ""bearish on the taxi segment"" as grab's ambition to grow its footprint will ""continue to put pressure"" on comfortdelgro's taxi business.  ""we have pencilled in an 8 per cent decline for comfortdelgro's average taxi fleet over our forecast period,"" the report added.  regulations are in place for comfortdelgro's decision to take the fight to private-hire companies.  the competition and consumer commission of singapore has mandated that drivers be free to use any ride-booking app they wish, and that operators cannot enforce exclusivity clauses.  the land transport authority and public transport council have given the green light for surge pricing by taxi operators.  mr ang hin kee, deputy chairman of the government parliamentary committee for transport, noted that some commuters are unhappy with surge pricing, but added that with comfortdelgro's large fleet, the ""ceiling of how high dynamic fare can rise may be curtailed"".  ""furthermore, grab, gojek and comfortdelgro may compete through better terms and incentives to attract commuters,"" he said, noting that waiting time for passengers may also shorten with access to a bigger fleet.  mr ang, who is also executive adviser to the national taxi association and the national private hire vehicles association, added: ""with the various fare types, comfortdelgro drivers will also experience less empty cruising and not depend only on street hailing or phone bookings. that is in keeping with available technology.  ""hopefully, operators will not pass on cost increases from this new offering to drivers.""",Positive

(the taxi share system for the) whole (of) singapore is down, same as their trains,” he told today, adding that the smrt has promised a refund of his s$68 10-hour rental. > “it has happened to me twice so far (in seven months).”> smrt’s taxi share scheme allows those with a taxi driving vocational license to rent taxis in three-hourly blocks by picking up and returning the taxi at a location that is convenient to them. > so far, smrt is the only taxi operator adopting such a model where taxi drivers do not have to seek a relief driver to cover the cost of a rented vehicle should they not wish to commit full-time. > hourly rental varies across the day between s$6.80 and s$s$12.80.  > [source](http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/part-time-smrt-cabbies-locked-out-taxis-server-glitch)---v2.0 | [github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [readme/changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/readme.md)",Positive

"peak hour is a function of user behavior, and is not something that arises from a common definition of ""public transport"". unlike mrts and a lesser extent buses (who get bus lanes), taxis share the road with private cars, and so the taxi peak hour is more related to peak hour for private cars. if i had to guess - taxi (and car users) experience  slightly delayed peak hour compared to mrt/buses because taxi and car users anticipate a shorter journey as compared to using public transport. so everyone sets out later.",Positive
"just to give one small reason why taxis may have different peak hours. **also, this is a hypothesis which is valid only for evening and i don't have any actual data to prove it. i could be wrong as well.**i would say people taking taxis and buses/mrt are coming from a different economic background. i would say generally someone   would be higher up in the hierarchy of any organization and an extension of that is they would be willing to pay for a taxi ride from my personal observation i would say the higher your position, the later you work in office. leaving late from office you may be willing to take a taxi instead of bus/mrt which may account for different peak timings in the evening.",Positive

"cos you look at smrt which has both mrt/bus and taxi but the peak hour for both is different. not only does taxi is able to maximise profit by having longer peak hours, the mrt/bus's shorter hours also reduces cost for them as they only need to have more services for a shorter period of time. if you consider the demand for public service transportation as a whole, shouldn't it be going up (peaking) at roughly the same time? if they justify that after 6pm onwards, people are going home so there higher demand(peak) for taxis. shouldnt the mrt/bus demand is also be higher(peak) and hence consider their peak as after 6pm and be held to a service level of lower frequency after 6pm accordingly? but right now their peak is only 1700 to 1900.",Positive
