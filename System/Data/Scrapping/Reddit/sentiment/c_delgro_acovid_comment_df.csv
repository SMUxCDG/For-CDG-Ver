you know grab screwed up when taxi fares are lower than fares on grab,Neutral
"love it. more competition is sorely needed in the transportation sector, and grab should’ve never been allowed to buy uber sg in the first place.",Positive
honestly sometimes comfort is cheaper than other taxi services. and they would pick me up/drop me off at far flung places,Positive
"i'm no fan of grab at all. but i remember before uber and grab came along, cdg was the og monopolistic bully in the market. they'd raise taxi rental on drivers and increase fare at will. it was also super hard to get taxis. if i needed a taxi on weekends or weekday peak hours, i could wait up to 1 hour by the road cos sengkang was supposedly very far. most of us have forgotten the experience of standing by the road waving at taxis and them not stopping, and later when we finally caved in and call, we see the same taxis coming to pick us up. taxis used to be such luxury and would easily cost double or more the fares today. i  only had budget for 2 taxi rides a month as a young adultuber (not grab) changed everything!",Positive
"i actually very much want to use comfort over grab. however for me somehow when comparing prices between comfort and grab (from central to the north), it’s usually the same price (which i’ll book comfort) or grab is slightly cheaper (though now with the extra 1 dollar comfort may edge slightly ahead) -  not sure if this is unique to long d trips?",Positive
good. more competition always benefit consumers,Positive
"ah the weekly grab circlejerk. people still forget that grab tends to be cheaper during peak hours and is more consistent.i use all taxi brands and whichever is the cheapest, i go for it. definitely am liking this move from cdg.",Positive
comfort is mostly cheaper these days and the fact that their drivers are laojiao taxi drivers with no need for gps (which can be wrong at times).,Negative
they should fix their app first. the discount code always has glitches. even though the discount has been applied somehow you end up paying the full fare.,Positive
always used comfort after uber left.,Neutral
finally. for years cdg has been growing fat and slow from its near monopoly in taxi booking. only until uber and grab started with their vastly superior apps that they start to wake up the idea and start investing in developing their platform.,Negative
"didnt they just launch zig with a lot of advertisment and promos, why would they get ready to launch another mega app with the same services?!",Positive
"great, competition at work!",Positive
"fuck grab, that is all",Negative
this is my experience. grab drivers need gps and cannot go off map as they don't care to know the shortcut. cdg drivers thru zip don't use gps. they tell me the shortcuts they will take.the metered fares should be phased out as they encourage tricks of the trade. zip and low fares is the way to claw back business. maybe grab will be aggressive with their promotions after p2ha!,Neutral
uber came and grab conquered.gojek came and grab still survived.now fight comfort.,Neutral
plot twist: grab buys over comfortdelgro,Neutral
"big big hooray from me! stop grab's money grabbing! support companies with diversified shareholding and stop padding the pockets of anthony tan! so many unethical practices and always go back on their promises (still angry they cancelled my delivery pass just when covid struck). rather tip the delivery guy more and pay grab less, that's the true meaning of support local, not support one man's pocket.",Positive
as someone who visits singapore frequently for work i was actually surprised how much cheaper (not affordable but cheaper) a conventional cab was vs grab...,Positive
"great to see cdg add services and improve.without competition, maybe they won't even have a mobile app.",Positive
they need to improve their app. it has a horrible user interface now. drivers and cars good though.,Positive
"i deliberately use comfort or gojek even if grab is cheaper. every single time i dealt with that company either as a consumer or an employee, they stank of  corporate greed of the worst kind.",Negative
during late night grab is usually cheaper.,Negative
nothing to love imo. they already had an app. now they are adding unrelated services into it like car rental which is irrelevant to 99 percent of current app users.,Positive
you are so right! i've been a loyal cdg user rhese days but i did forget of the monopoly days where we were at the mercy of cabbies.getting a cab after a night out was a nightmare on certain time of the day. i lived in the city. all the cabs wanted to go to bedok and wouldnt pick me up. i walked home on some days.,Positive
"i hated that constant increase of fare, and stupid reasons of we haven't increased fares in so and so years. then when they introduce a new taxi model bam! higher fares.but the absolute worst thing is the confusing as fuck surcharges, and area surcharges and surcharge for pickup at airport and rws/mbs.and if that's not all.....cdg owns sbs transit, who fucks you by constantly increasing bus fares year on year.so when people see cdg as some sort of 'saviour' from the likes of grab, all i see is a giant knocked of it's perch and now playing the victim.fyi: grab actually started of as grabtaxi which actually tried to solve the issue of an app for taxi booking.",Negative
"honestly there are some factors determining the price, such as distance, traffic and demand, to name but a few. ultimately if they are around the same price, i'd rather flag down a taxi for a cheaper price (no booking fee) and just go by the meter, especially when i know that there is little to no traffic. just curious if you book comfort, do you use flat rate or go by meter?",Negative
flat rate as shown on the app which is the one that is similar to grab. meter price always seems higher on the app (!!),Positive
"i've heard that grab is able to peek at the other apps running in your phone, and can detect when you're price shopping and adjust their offered price so that they don't lose out. whereas if you're not actively comparing, they know it's safe to gouge you.",Positive
"this is an important point, my personal experience is comfortdelgro cabbies have generally higher and more consistent professional quality - know the places, know the ways, smooth driving. some part-time grab drivers can really drive you crazy. one time the gps was not accurate in showing the entrance of the complex, and my dear driver religiously followed the gps and took me around the block two rounds....",Positive
if at first you don’t succeed…,Positive
"pretty sure grab's only enemy is itself, it dominate the market as long as it doesn't self destruct. comfort ,like all giant glc in sg , is unlikely to change or innovate fast enough and will die a slow death..",Positive
s'poreans to cdg :  you have become the very thing that you swore to destroy !,Negative
u mean ‘grab’ your money ?,Negative
>straitstimes.com/singap...makes me wonder where all the grab investor money went.,Neutral
how?,Neutral
"they are in completely different businesses though. grab is going into finance, emerging markets, marketplace and so on, whereas comfort deals in the more established existing transport system. looking at grabs upcoming ipo, the additional funds injected + investor pressure will make it interesting to see if they will turn profitable within 2 years. if they do, i believe their future prospect would be better than that of comfort.entering new markets (be it geographical or product wise) is always difficult, you need to pump money in it.",Positive
taxi rental is expensive as fk.,Negative
marketing? they did a pretty good job at it.,Positive
maybe anthony has a holiday home at hokkaido too lol,Positive
"finance is not just payments but, yes i do think your points are valid from that perspective. shrugs who knows what will happen, i just know the anti grab circlejerk is strong in this sub.",Positive
i took a cab once but the fare exceeded what i had by a few dollars. i apologized to the uncle and gave him all my cash. he was like are you okay? later no cash how? and even said that i didn't need to pay. i insisted on giving him the cash anyway.thank you kind unclethis was years ago when i was a nsf,Positive
"nice touch and rare because lots of times, there are arseholes passengers that just run off without paying\*dad's a taxi driver so i heard lots of stories.",Positive
“if he no cash”,Neutral
wonderful that the passenger posted on fb to shout out this act of kindness.,Positive
"> # comfortdelgro cabby tells passenger he need not pay s$8.32 trip if he no cash> there are many nice cab drivers in singapore, and here's yet another anecdote about one of them.> as told in a facebook post from aug. 24, one arun took a comfortdelgro cab as he was rushing to go to work on a sunday afternoon (aug. 22).> passenger had no cash> as the cab was making its journey from bedok to loyang, arun asked the driver if he could pay for the fare via cashless payment methods as he had no cash on him.> unfortunately, the driver couldn't accept that as the taxi's payment terminal couldn't connect to the network.> driven to pay his fare, arun made several other suggestions, including stopping by an atm to withdraw some cash or paying via paynow.> however, the driver told him that there are no atms along the way and he has not registered for paynow.> taxi driver refused payment> instead, the driver apparently told the passenger not to worry and to treat it as a free trip instead.> arun asked the driver for his phone number in an attempt to contact him when he finally has the cash to make payment.> however, the driver continued to refuse.> as if his small act of kindness wasn't enough, the driver gave him the receipt for the trip worth s$8.32 so that arun can make a claim from his employers.> appreciating the driver's efforts, arun said: ""(the) driver was really kind-hearted and deserved to be recognised. thank you for your kindness!""> you can read the full post here.> top image from deborah sim on facebook.> follow and listen to our podcast here---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Positive
nice gesturebut why is the need to claim from employer if no cash was paid ?,Positive
"my mum used to be a taxi driver. occasionally, she encountered customers who promised to return and pay back fares when they got home. after few hours, she waited but to no avail. the fares were more than $10 per trip.",Positive
"that's amazingly nice of him. i've met some really nice cabbies in my time in singapore, once i've had a driver give me a free lift back while out running at night and caught in a heavy thunderstorm.the last time i had a similar encounter as op's though, the taxi driver made me get off his car in the middle of the road while stopped at a traffic light. fuck those red taxis, i always avoid them nowadays. they're the ones that always mysteriously have their cashless payment not working.",Positive
a great man once said: “it’s not about the money. it’s about sending a message.”,Positive
"i once had a hitch driver tell me i didn't have to pay him that $10 because on the journey, i mentioned i was still a student.totally didn't expect that, and the ride was pretty enjoyable even before that. (we had a good convo) wherever he is, i hope that driver's doing good now.",Positive
"this is news?years ago when i was taking the cab to the starting point of stanchart marathon in the early wee hours of the morning, after reaching the destination i wanted to pay the cab via paywave/nets because i didn't bring any cash (due to race and i didn't bring any additional baggage for it). the cab driver just don't want to be bother with using the nets/paywave terminal and say 'no need to pay, just go and race. good luck!'.i should have reported my 'news story' to mothership back then...",Positive
"i get that it is a nice gesture but honestly, why not use paynow?",Positive
nice and all but not really a big deal..,Positive
"lai karens of singapore! how do we change the narrative here?1) 1 star rating - this cab driver so backward. cannot accept cashless. what is lta doing?2) ware my time. if driver cannot accept cashless, he must prepare to be cashless merely a joke ar… dun angree",Negative
this sort of thing happened to me before too and it took a long time to wire money because i was busy — like i don’t get to eat anything all day busy. i think a more important point here is the cabbies are often losing business because they’re not given sufficient support in terms of payments modes and tech in general…  cabbies lose income and cab companies lose market share to private hire companies with a better app.,Positive
"can send the money to comfort delgro to pay what, also the app can scan qr to pay street hail also.",Neutral
"my dad ever received a fake $2 note before. didn’t realise it until he reached home to count his earnings. could only llst and lodge a police report, but no suspects since it was a street hail and all the way back in ‘06 or ‘07.",Negative
i got so used to apps that once i almost forgot to pay a street hail.luckly he reminded me.,Neutral
honestly don’t understand this kind of people tbh is not like they have no money also wtf,Positive
why use lot word,Neutral
"i also didn't, but i think most wouldn't be familiarised with it especially the older generation",Positive
it’s about sending ~~a message~~ the passenger to his destination.,Neutral
"yeah, why didn't you? a genuine question. that was a kind gesture! the taxi driver should be recognised by his magnanimousness. you should have at least write in to give a complement as well eh.",Positive
">however, the driver told him that there are no atms along the way and he has not registered for paynow.passenger suggested paynow. cabby said not registered with paynow.",Neutral
its not about the money. its about the gesture,Neutral
lol it is pretty much a big deal considering how bad cabbies have it these days.,Positive
"my family got scammed by a taxi driver once, we received two malaysian notes instead of two $10 sgd notes. the taxi driver didn't switch on the light inside the car when counting change for $50 and he drove off very quickly once we got out. the malaysian notes were also red, and sandwiched in between other notes, so it took us a few moments to realise.didn't manage to catch the license plate number, and this was many years ago so... welp.fuck you, random taxi driver, i hope karma got you for that.",Negative
no clue why you got downvoted. isnt this considered false claims,Negative
wa lao free one leh,Positive
i know. my point is that it's nice but you are treating it like such an exceptional thing. is it really so exceptional? like it's way above normal courtesy that people show to those in need? that's saying that on average most people are not willing to be so nice and that makes me sad. i think it's not such a big deal because surely most people would be nice like this? according to your view its a really exceptional thing worth noting. im saying its nice but it really isn't a big deal or it should be,Positive
"these days? probably not worth the risk/reward ratio. but you've gotta remember that $2 was more valuable 15 years ago, so people could still be bothered to fake em.",Negative
too small to take action against. most often not worth the time and effort to get back the justice,Positive

well u be surprisedmy sisters didnt even know how to register/don’t bother/don’t care to have paynow until i guided her and helped herthere are lots of boomers and elder generation who arent electronically savvy and still feel cash is king and they dont even trust e banking like my dad. they rather deposit $ through atm/branches,Neutral
"ah i get what you mean. you're saying that such cases of decency should be treated as normal and we shouldnt be setting the bar so low that such acts are framed as spectacular/newsworthy.fair enough i agree with you, that we should all be kinder and such acts should be made more common.",Positive
singapore’s inflation is extremely low. 15 years ago $2 was probably worth like $4 now. this is still weird,Positive
any tips for purchasing my first used bike will be appreciated as well. :),Positive
"the simulator is gross af, at least for driving classes. super nauseating.edit:also not even close to simulating real life, puts you in the most ridiculous situations which you can’t get out of. for example, as you’re turning, suddenly a car speeds up towards you even though you have right of way and a person starts running across the road you’re turning into. then they tell you you failed to drive safely.",Positive
"i got my 2b from bbdc and their lesson breakdown is into stages 1 to 8, with each stage having 1 to 3 lessons. it seems like for cdc, if you're fairly proficient you can complete all objectives of one lesson in one session? i managed to pass every single theory and practical stage on first try except for one practical lesson, and it cost me around 800+ iirc. this was in april this year.",Positive
"i did my 2a recently at ubi, had the same experience with class bookings not having any slots available. but usually i camped the portal and took up slots cancelled by others. i think the 2a and 2 bikes were a bit better, all with relatively few kms on the meter. 2b bikes are really crappy bikes.lesson 3 did 2 times, tp test passed in one time",Positive
"nice writeup! i am almost done with my 2b at bbdc (just have 8.01 and tp to go), and i feel that whatever you've written is close to what i have experienced at bbdc. cost-wise, i would say that my total expenses would closely match up to yours (and this includes me failing a few lessons and having to repeat them).i'll just add on some things that might be helpful to anyone else currently doing their 2b:**practicing for rtt**i booked 1 session of the rtp to check out the practice questions, and i found that almost all of the questions in the practice (from booklets 1 to 4; i didn't finish booklet 5) are matching those [listed on guidescroll](https://guidescroll.com/2020/03/singapore-class-2b-riding-theory-test-question-bank/). the questions given by the school and listed on guidescroll are more or less what i saw being tested in the actual rtt.if you *really* want to save ~$3+ instead of booking the rtp, you can try out this rtt quizzer i made ([github repository](https://github.com/teclu/rtt-quizzer) | [github pages](https://www.teclu.ml/rtt-quizzer/)). it is using the questions and answers listed on guidescroll, and i have also done some additional checks and revisions to make sure that the provided questions and answers are correct. hopefully, this helps someone!**booking for lessons**it's difficult to get lessons, especially on weekends. if you do not have the time to keep checking the booking page, expect to wait around 1.5 to 2 weeks for the next available lesson. if you are in a hurry to get your 2b for whatever reason, i can vouch that op's tip of spending a lot of time refreshing the booking page would help. sometimes, people may give up their lesson slots within 24 hours of the lesson; if you're able to take lessons on a short notice, you can always try checking daily. my friend was able to get his 2b at bbdc within ~4 months (end january to early may) by doing so.if you have some scripting experience, i think it's very possible to automate this entire process so that you can ""snipe"" lesson slots that are given up by others since there's no captcha or other safeguards implemented (personally, i didn't have the time to do this nor was i in a hurry to clear my 2b, so i didn't bother doing this). otherwise, just keep checking every hour or so, and you might get lucky and find a suitable and earlier slot for yourself.**dealing with failure**just to quote one of the instructors i had: ""it's better if you fail here at school, pay extra to retake the lesson, than to fail outside on the main road and get injured or lose your life."" failing lessons can be discouraging and you might be bummed out that you're ""wasting"" money on retaking them, but honestly its not a waste. just think of it as extra practice and a way to reduce your chances of failing the next lesson, evaluation, and test.all the best for your tp test /u/yang_; may the road conditions be in your favour!",Positive

"for those who don't know, you can somewhat adjust the biting point of 2b bikes by turning the ringlock thingy at the clutch cable just after the clutch lever. useful if the clutch only starts to engage when the lever is very far outclass 2a and class 2 bikes feels a lot better in terms of maintenance and quality",Positive

(usually people will disclose upfront but some don’t)hopefully also you want to see the following (esp for older bikes)-	how the engine is from a cold start (you might have to tell the owner don’t warm up before you reach)-	try out the signalling and all-	check out if the chain is clean or not (more of a thing i look out personally, some people don’t clean their chain and it gives me the impression that they don’t care for their bikes)-	check out the paintwork (has it discoloured? is it still shiny? might come from petrol being spilled during refilling esp near the tank or from parking in the open instead of in the shelter)list is not exhaustive, anyone else can add to this! cheers and ride safe! get gear if you can and try to wear it frequently, quite a lot of people buy then sell shortly after because they realise it’s too warm for their liking",Positive

"been riding since 2007, i think fortnine on youtube is absolute gold for most things motorcycling be it gear, used bike advice, helmets and all. best to find a mate who rides to go view the bike w you. decide on the type of riding you plan to be doing, is it mostly just to get around, do you need plenty of luggage space, will you be riding in traffic alot, how much maintenance cost is a factor as well as fuel economy or is all of those not an issue and you just want the fastest and nicest ride available? bear in mind most people do not hold on to their class 2b bike once they get their 2a and almost never once they get class 2. best to find a bike that isn't the nicest or the cheapest, something in the middle with good resale value and just have fun with it. lastly find a reputable bike shop and maybe the local whatsapp/telegram grp for ur bike model. plenty of advice can be gotten from there.",Positive

"if you're planning to upgrade to 2a and beyond, you should aim for a used bike that has at least 2 years coe remaining. the money you save can help you with buying a first hand 2a or 2 bike in the future. also to add to this point, try not to get a scooter or a semi-automatic bike if you plan to upgrade as soon as your one year probation is up. this is just my personal experience but you might get rusty when you go for your first few lessons with the manual bike after one year of not using the clutch. bike-wise, i know a few of my friends getting a fz16 after passing their tp cos it looks good for a 2b bike and since it's a popular, it's easy to find spare parts.",Positive

i agree with the bounty thing to catch bugs and loopholes. that’s what a lot of the software companies do. but the charges towards him came from him using the loophole and getting people to pay him the supposed cab fares. i think he wouldnt have been charged (or been charged a lower sentence) if he didnt do the exploitation part.,Neutral

i agree with you that it is weird comfortdelgro seems to have no responsibility on it even though the fault lies with their software.exploitation is wrong but it’s hard to stop all kinds of exploit. the rich ones just have more power and resources to protect themselves when the exploitation is exposed.,Negative
"comfortdelgro should have just seeked for retrieval of the unpaid fares cause technically little to no damage was done. hopefully he can get a lawyer to help him cause it seems quite unfair despite him being greedy trying to profit from it.the retrieval of the unpaid fares would negate all profits made and technically still punish the individual as he have to pay for the fares incurred from others rides. they didn't have to mess up one individual's life who happen to find a ""cheat code"".in the same aspect with online game bugs that messes up the game's economy, you aren't going to get brought to court cause it isn't the player's fault. they could ban you at most cause you broke the terms and that's it. technically this causes even more damage than the comfortdelgro's case.",Positive

"can i use grabpay card for comfortdelgro taxi fares?it is advisable that you don’t use grabpay card for comfortdelgro taxi fares as there may be instances whereby the reversal of charges for cancelled bookings are not correctly reflected on the grabpay card. to avoid such a situation, we would advise you to switch to other credit/debit cards.i had used grabpay card for comfortdelgro taxi trips but i am unable to match the fares that are charged to the grabpay card. why is that the case?it could be because you had cancelled the booking and the reversal of fares is not reflected in the grabpay card’s transaction records. should you encounter such a situation, please contact grabpay immediately to find out when these charges will be reversed as it depends solely on grabpay as the card issuer.from the cdg faqs. they dun recommend using grab credit card https://www.cdgtaxi.com.sg/faq/cashless-payment-promo-codes/",Negative

"could be a periodic pre-auth accross the accounts to ensure customers has valid credit card for payment before each ride, imagine finding out your card is invalid when you about to make payment and has no cash on hand.  but usually other merchant would do this just before you do a booking like grab that would put the full amount on hold until you complete the ride. best to check with them directly and their reasoning",Positive
