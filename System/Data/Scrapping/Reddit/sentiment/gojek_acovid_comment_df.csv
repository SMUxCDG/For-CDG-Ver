nets machine not working tho,Neutral
maybe they cheap and dont want pay swipe fees i guess. comfort del gro accepts cc and various other payments,Positive
it’s funny because they think they’re saving money on tax but they’re not. they just lose business. i purposely avoid taking smrt taxis for this very reason.,Positive
have stepped in some cabs not sure which brand which doesn't even have nets and only accept cash.. and i'm just like.. how backwards is that.,Negative
"was it smrt or transcab that only accepted cash for the longest time 🤔 i can't remember. i tend to only take comfort cabs because of this. whatever they think is the best for their business, i guess. 🤷‍♀️",Positive
i think this happen when negotiation with credit card company fail.,Negative
due to the end of contract with the payment provider. of course they did say they are looking for a new provider,Positive
previously comfort delgro had the same thing too and they charged extra for nets payment. they've learnt from it i guess.,Negative
"i always take a comfort cab even though there is a transcab or smrt cab in front of the queue. there is also this scan qr to pay feature though some drivers don't know how to use, or maybe find it a chore.",Neutral
waits 10mins while cabbie fumbles with nets machind,Neutral
this is reactionary to the merchant fees imposed by banks to process your credit transactions.it's either this or they raise prices again and everyone kpkb. pls la you think grab and gojek keep their prices and absorb all price increases?,Neutral
there is no nets upside….,Neutral
"well, at least you know and can vote with your feet. there are other options for taxis though, comfortdelgro allows all sorts of payment options, no need to stoop to grab or gojek",Negative
credit card can reverse payment i think,Neutral
tekn0l0gy,Neutral
maybe they have a partnership with nets who ask for this bc they have been badly hit by covid,Negative
it's a negotiation move with credit card networks over fee structure,Neutral
cash is king!always wondered why some cabbies like to put the “cash terms only” tentcard on their dashboard.,Neutral
this was a post wirecard issue when they were found to be a fraud. a number of firms (e.g. m1) who were using wirecard to process credit card payments couldn't switch out immediately. stop taking things out of context and spread uninformed opinions.,Neutral
i appreciate that they are telling passengers upfront. nothing wrong.,Negative
"credit card companies can charge from a high 2% to almost 4% per transaction, so from a cost perspective, i can understand why smrt chose to forego credit cards.obviously it does not benefit the customers in any shape or form",Positive
"yo op, after reading thru your comments about ""customer hostile"". i get that it is clearly inconvient to you. clearly smrt has weigh their options and they can live with cash/nets. personally i find the term quite aggressive. let the market decide whether opting out cc is a bad option for them.",Positive
"you do know that smrt partnered with grab since sept 2020 right, op? hence this policy on payment modes.",Positive
"no wonder when i took comfort recently, the qr codes were torn off in car",Neutral
"...then don't use their service? not like you don't have a choice right.besides, which singaporean resident does not have a nets mode of payment on them at all times?",Positive
would argue that we should move away from cards altogether,Neutral
“not working”,Neutral
normally they pass on the fees to passengers. but the most important point is not to limit the options for passengers.,Positive
"that’s the reason why i opt mainly for comfort taxis at taxi stands, even if they are not the first one in line. the ability to pay directly by scanning the qr code using their app.",Positive
just use paynow,Neutral
"exactly. and since they supposedly have a partnership with grab, why not offer grabpay? counting out coins while trying to gather up my daughter, her ipad, my bag and getting ready to open an umbrella.... it's the penny pinching nonsense that irritates.",Positive
"it's astonishing to me that no one at smrt has done the arithmetic. my fare is \~$11 for 9km. a prius gets 4.5l/100km, so fuel ($2/l) is \~80c. the cost of the car, driver doesn't go away if he sits at the rank and the marginal wear and tear is tiny. let's round it up to a marginal cost of $1 for a $11 fare = $10 gross profit.grabpay is 1%. if everyone pays with grabpay and they have to give up 11c per ride, then they only need to attract 1 marginal ride from someone who doesn't have cash to pay for the other 100 to break even. but of course not everyone will, some will stay with cash, so the breakeven drops even more. it's a literal no brainer.",Negative
"meanwhile, comfortdelgro allows scanning qr code in the taxi to switch to credit card or apple pay payment options.",Neutral
"afaik that's only the owner-operated cabs, which are a dying breed in sg.",Neutral
you could ask the uncle whether he has paynow?,Neutral
comfort making decent st(rides) towards their digitalisation. the next step is to see if they want to offer more services like on-demand courier etc.,Positive
"yes, because going to jail for fraud and theft is so worth it to save the 10 bucks for a cab.",Positive
"> always wondered why some cabbies like to put the “cash terms only” tentcard on their dashboard.if i remember correctly, comfort etc used to take forever to pay out fares paid by card, which didn't help the cab driver's cash flow. this might have changed when uber and grab entered the market.",Neutral
"it has been quite some time since then, surely a big company could have found a way to use one of the many big providers to provide this service if they wanted.",Positive
"what's the missing context? that  over 9 months ago, a payment processor went bust, causing problems for their merchant customers? that every other merchant seems to to have regained the facility in a couple of weeks at most? is the missing context that every other business in singapore is jumping into cashless payments, and that besides credit cards, businesses of all sizes have plenty of options: paynow, dash, grab, fave, alipay plus many more. that the singapore government is investing in initiatives to remove barriers to adoption of cashless technologies, driving mas and the industry to standardise on interworking, and outright subsidising transaction fees during pilot programs? and in that context, smrt is rolling back to cash only (and nets debit if the machine works, possibly the only piece of technology less reliable than a mcdonalds ice cream machine).as other posters have said, i can vote with my feet and my wallet. but the last survey of sme's in singapore showed that 65% of merchants would be more likely to adopt is customers asked them to. so, this is me, a customer, asking them to adopt a modern cashless payment method.",Positive
"> i appreciate that they are telling passengers upfront.how is this really upfront? imagine only taking cabs once a year (or being a tourist), wanting to pay by card, and being stuck because payment methods aren't standardised across companies.",Positive
"it's not ""wrong"" in the sense of unethical, it's wrong in the sense of it being horribly customer hostile. there are dozens of choices in singapore for new cashless payments and they've managed to agree arrangements with none of them? it's complacency and a penny-wise, dollar foolish mindset.",Negative
"i get that, but also there are modern solutions that are far cheaper. grabpay is 1%. if smrt's ""partnership"" with grab is serious, they should be a discounted version of that for all their drivers. i don't get how my little corner coffee shop takes paylah for a $1 bottle of water and yet smrt, one of the biggest corporations in the country, cannot think of a way to bring their payments into the 21st century.",Negative
"is it ""hence""? i do know about the partnership, and that seems to be why smrt has no app of it's own. i suppose they see that as a saving. but they have put the flow of bookings almost entirely into the hands of a competitor. they will only get scraps of the leftovers that grab can't handle themselves. and it's a really weak partnership that doesn't even have an option for grab pay for street hails.",Positive
was it actually?! you can report it to comfort you know.,Neutral
and what will happen when tourism resumes?,Neutral
"me. a lot of the time i only have my phone and maybe a $10 note. with my phone i have my debit cards, my ez-link and paylah/paynow. i don't need nets for anything usually.",Negative
"> besides, which singaporean resident does not have a nets mode of payment on them at all times?what if someone was out on a run, and only carried their phone with apple pay?",Neutral
me. i've walked out of daiso without buying anything several times because i didn't have enough cash or a nets/atm card on me. i pay for almost everything these days using apple pay. only have a small amount of cash on me for use at places like hawker centres. (and a lot of places take paynow too so that's even less need to use cash/nets...),Negative
"my criticism of smrt is my free gift to them, a little snapshot that might help them understand why they are failing against grab & gojek. the smrt cab was the only one on the rank, and i stupidly didn't think to double check nets was available because, well, it's 2021. the driver helpfully waited until we were 100 metres on the journey before revealing ""nets machine broken, lah, cash only."" rookie mistake, i blame myself.",Negative
then let's see your arguments,Neutral
"not disagreeing, but would love to know the reason.",Positive
"the app doesn't charge the fees, if you scan the code in the taxi. it's super convenient; hailing a taxi is still usually cheapest even compared to grab/gojek.",Positive
and some of those bengster transcab cabbies,Neutral
"i had a taxi driver inform me that this was because smrt was affected by the abrupt closure of wirecard payment services in oct 2020, and have yet to find a suitable payment provider with equivalent rates.reference: [https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/mas-orders-wirecard-to-cease-payment-services-in-singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/mas-orders-wirecard-to-cease-payment-services-in-singapore)",Positive
"which tourist does not carry cash with them? that is completely besides the point, though. if you don't like what a business is practicing, don't use them. let market forces decided whether it was a correct decision for the business or not.making a post crying about it is just plain silly.",Negative
"you do know that debit cards have nets, right?",Positive
then run back home and don't take a cab,Neutral
"daiso accepts nets qr btw! (which is just a limited version of paynow that only supports local banks - scan with dbs paylah, ocbc, uob, etc) most places that accept nets, also automatically accept qr payments out of the box - even if the cashier doesn't know it.",Positive
"i pay for most stuff using apple pay too, but i don't handicap myself by removing any nets capable payment methods from myself. doing the latter is honestly quite stupid.",Positive
"could be anything: profiling, data breaching, social engineering, things that make people look nervous when questioned about their lifestyles.for example, a purchase of a couple of lingerie but you're single.",Positive
"yup but somehow someone is absorbing the cost. most likely comfort is subsidizing the cost to consumer (i remember a while back visa transactions were charged extra). but even if smrt doesn't want to do this subsidy, they should show the cost openly to consumer and let them decide how to pay. removing the option altogether is the worst thing they can do.",Negative
"yes, and starbucks was hit by this too, as wirecard was their payment processor. they were offline for credit cards for maybe two weeks at the most. for consistency, smrt should bring back the toyota crown taxi. if you’re going to pretend it’s the 90’s, own it!",Positive
i worked in singapore for a few months. i didn't have a net card for the first few days. and the only reason i knew i had to get one was because i lived on singapore prior (and coworkers told me to get one). from a foreigner's perspective it's quite surprising to see this kind of change.,Positive
">which tourist does not carry cash with them?when i travelled in europe i normally had at most 40 euros in cash with me, i could pay for everything else with a credit card.",Positive
"tourists can’t use their own debit card in an atm. so unless you’ve sorted it before you come to singapore or go to a special money change place they have no way to pay.additionally, people on short term visas like working holiday can’t open bank accounts here.",Positive
if we didn't make posts complaining about things then r/singapore would be the deadest subreddit on the board!,Neutral
">	which tourist does not carry cash with them?me? most western tourists coming from increasingly cashless societies? i don't want to guess how much i need to exchange at some dodgy money exchange, lose on the exchange fee, then have excess that i can't convert. i have a significant amount of cash in random ass currecy that i kept until the departing airport.i'd much rather just my credit card that gives my points, has no foreign exchange fees, and gives me the mid market exchange rate which is significantly better than any money exchange service.",Positive
his debit card is accessible through his phone. not a physical debit card.,Neutral
"yeah i know debit cards have nets. does it work when using google pay on my phone? as far as i am aware, it doesn't, because google pay uses a ""virtual card"" or something.",Positive
"right, maybe i wasn't specific enough. what if someone was out exercising, and either got lost or felt some kind of heart problem that required stopping the exercise?",Positive
"ah, i got it.",Neutral
but grab does the same though,Neutral
"bit stupid to go to a foreign country without cash, tbh.",Negative
then carry a physical debit card. or don't use smrt cabs.,Neutral
how did google pay come about lol.does your debit card having nets not mean that you are perfectly capable of making a transaction on a smrt taxi trip?,Positive
"if you're lost and no nets - get a grab, gojek, ryde or comfort. if you're having heart problems, get an ambulance.",Neutral
hence i pay by cash.helps that my account was registered in malaysia when they first launched their app in 2014.,Positive
">	bit stupid to go to a foreign country without cashsince you have poor reading comprehebsion, i didn't say no cash. i said no local currency. been traveling for years nonstop. have some emergency usd otherwise don't carry local currency prior. atms exist?",Negative
"why bring two when one enough? when people are challenging for improvement, why stick with the norm?",Positive
"i meant i don't actually carry my debit card with me all the time, instead using google pay.",Neutral
> helps that my account was registered in malaysia when they first launched their app in 2014.what's the benefit of this?,Positive
okay. bit stupid to travel to a foreign country with no local currency tbh.is that better?,Positive
"in this particular case, one certainly doesn't seem to be enough, so...",Positive
"ah. not sure why you wouldn't, though. then don't use smrt cabs?",Negative
"grab is being regulated by the singapore government [through one of its subsidiaries](https://www.grab.com/sg/pay/why-is-verifying-your-account-and-setting-up-grabpin-important/) so they require more information **about you** (despite their [assurances against data breach](https://help.grab.com/passenger/en-sg/360023805331) which, by the way, [they had breached 4 times](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/grab-fined-10k-over-fourth-data-privacy-breach-in-two-years) already).me being an extraterritorial ""entity"" exempts the requirement for grab to have my information. they registered me as a malaysian resident, and i registered with them long before all of the laws came into effect, so they only had my information as when i was a resident in malaysia. i can still use grab in singapore, but i cannot use credit facilities in tandem with their grabpay.",Negative
bit old-fashioned to think that way.some countries yes definitely need local currency. other countries like us singapore etc you should be able to reasonably go around without needing local currency.,Positive
as a seasoned traveler i disagree? you clearly still travel with a boomer mentality lmao. backpacking 40+ countries and never had an issue not having foreign currency on arrival. neither did any of the folks i met. i guess i'm stupid lmao.,Negative
"i think grab only requires a phone number (and device model, etc) unless you want a non-basic payment facility from them, or their grabpay card.",Neutral
you can do that in singapore and malaysia too. just not in this very specific example.,Negative
"carrying local currency for quick transaction and emergencies = boomer mentality lol. hey, i backpacked over 80 countries blindfolded, walking in reverse and only speaking ancient latin and never had any issues. anyone can make any claim online, it doesn't really carry any weight.",Positive
so taking a taxi is an emergency lmao.and to think backpacking however many countries is such an achievement that i'd want to falsify it online 😂i'm done with debating stupid.,Negative
>	but it’s possible albeit risky for the typical 1-2week holidays singaporeans takehence the part where it is 'a bit stupid' to do so.,Negative
"can you not think of scenarios where taking a taxi would help avoid a problem, like...missing a train?it's almost as if you've never travelled before lol. curious. have a good day, chump.",Positive
>	it’s almost as if you’ve never travelled before lol. curious.wow you got me! i'm not even singaporean lmao 😂 i can't even get a a vaccine in this country lmao.,Positive
what happened to being done with debating?,Neutral
duh. nothing grab does surprises me anymore.he can finally grab$ and also grabpower. congrats to him,Neutral
grabtaxi  grabfood  grabpay  grabdata  grabgojek,Neutral
">singapore-based unicorn grab has requested that founder anthony tan be the de facto “ceo for life” of a potential merged entity with gojek.  >  >tan also demanded significant voting power in the merged company, veto rights over board decisions, and a say in his compensation. grab and jakarta-based gojek are also talking about matters such as “who gets to appoint, and under what conditions, the new \[group\] ceo in the event that \[tan\] passes away. such powerrr",Positive
what is this? a chinese dynasty?,Neutral
stop using these services.,Neutral
the xjp of tech?,Neutral
"more monopoly? grab price is terrible now, even travelling to nearby places are double the cost when uber still exist. will it triple after merging with gojek.",Negative
ownself control ownself,Neutral
win liao lo,Positive
eh. what so surprising?many companies are like that. zucks facebook shares have ten times the voting rights of a normal share.,Positive
i cut down a lot already after realising that they kept increasing their prices and reducing their rewards/discounts after getting the lion's share of the market after booting uber out. now gojek also habis? they are just going to do whatever the fuck they want. i'm surprised that the authorities allowed this merger as it creates a monopoly in this market segment.,Negative
i hardly use grabfood now. prefer deliveroo,Negative
and use what?,Neutral
"a monopoly that the govt can control. your tastes for food, your travel destinations, your payment methods, all in one place when the govt needs it. why not?",Neutral
comfortdelgro app,Neutral
comfortdelgo...not even jokingthere are other apps too like ryde and tada but i'm not sure how many drivers are on it,Positive
ryde. been using it for months. good experience overall.,Positive
you got no legs?,Neutral
