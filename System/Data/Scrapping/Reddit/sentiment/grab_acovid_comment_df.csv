hmm i heard grab has put a ton of backend staff on no pay leave and is bleeding money like crazy cos of the reduced rides. op your points are valid. but likely on a macro scale grab food giggers are expendable fodder. especially now so many people got retrenched.,Negative

it’s stupid for grab to do all these at this critical timing. they wasted the chance to build staff loyalty. sbs is smart to send their malaysian staffs to 5 star hotel. all the best 👍🏼👍🏼,Positive
"as a customer let me just say i love deliveroo. they have always done good by me. and hearing how they treat riders best amongst all the operators, may i suggest we as consumers jump ship to them if we havent already?just 2 days ago i ordered a chicken dish with cooking juices (nonessential liquids that were part of the meal) that spilled out. the containers and the edible foods were not compromised so i just took it and told the delivery guy its fine, no issue. he said he would like to report it anway since its technically a spillage and i said sure. then he took some photos and left5 mins later deliveroo calls me and offers a full redelivery/refund. i said that wasnt necessary and then she asks if i can hold a while. i say ok and after another few minutes she tells me she has credited my account with about 50% of my order value",Positive

"i was a customer service officer team lead in their call center at mid view from 2016-2018. grab is a very manipulative company when it comes implementing their regulations , exploiting their “so called partners” legally without repercussions , and then doing pr to portray they are doing god’s work while the customer service team bears the full brunt of the drivers. they really do not care about the drivers partners.",Positive

"this. this is why i have never supported grab as a company. do i want them to go bust? no. then it will just be another sad case of us not having nice things. but grab as a company really need to change some of their policies and especially their app, which really sucks btw. it is one of the most resource demanding app i have ever used my whole life. but this comment is not about that. if there is the stipulated contractual limit of 4km, then do so by screenshotting the promise they claimed. then anytime you find a trip bigger than 4km, screenshot that as well. that would serve as evidence to fight against them.",Positive
"tbf (not to deliberately play the devils advocate), the main business of grab is probably suffering immensely from the drop in revenues from its ride-hailing business, so it does have to find some way to preserve its bottom line so as to stay solvent; i don’t think this is particularly predatory behaviour on grab’s part tbvh (feel free to correct me if i’m wrong)",Positive

"i used to be a full-time delivery rider for foodpanda (back when it was still orange), honestbee (before it's on the verge of bankruptcy), and other direct companies, for several years. so i can say that i fully understand and feel you.&#x200b;but i can somewhat see grab perspective. maximise profits while they are making losses elsewhere. as i understand, their cashcow is more towards food delivery compared to ridehailing. and having such a surplus of riders, definitely does not help the situation. the easy barrier of entry makes the job and deliveries very replaceable, compared to foodpanda and others.&#x200b;and to be fair, we part-time delivery riders were never employees of foodpanda/grab/deliveroo. we sign to proxy companies and work as contractors. they have no incentive to share too much of their welfare and profits to outside their company. it's just that with grab, you are part-time rider are even more distanced from the company.",Positive

"grab is symptomatic of those startups that have overextended themselves. just open the app: food, mart, delivery, insurance, gift cards, subscription, tickets, videos, hotels, and, yes, transport. cashless payment and a whole grassroots banking system that wants to replace fiat. social media features and friends messaging. a live blog. marketing offers from third parties that buy advertising space on the app. it’s a crowded, illegible mess, that exceeds the use case of 99% of its customers.its historical core mission (taken over from uber) is matching the supply and demand for private transport on the island. there’s a legitimate case for the platform being agnostic of *what* is being transported -i.e. it may cater equally to food bags, parcels, or passengers- but it should just focus on serving that purpose *exceptionally* well. that means smart dynamic pricing algorithms, a responsive ui, precise geolocation and routing, an app that learns the travel habits of its customers really well, an awesome matching system, etc.instead, it has fallen into the habitual trap of an egomaniac and grandiose vision for a “lifestyle app” that has to be and do everything for everyone. as a result, it does each thing poorly, hurting customer service for both users and delivery partners.they need a hard reset, or a lot more competition.",Positive

"biting the bullet to go against the general sentiment of this thread... but like another poster mentioned, i believe we've got to understand the bigger picture of how grab is doing. for a long time now, they've been rolling out their food delivery subscription service (it used to be $8 for a $5 & $10 voucher + free 30 deliveries with no minimum cost; think it's now $10 for the same amount for vouchers, but 50 deliveries and $10 min cost - pardon me if i'm mistaken, gave up that habit of grabfooding a while back).i used to be some of those dudes who would order a $6 meal (i knew a friend who would order a $3.50 bubble teas) and get free delivery. since grab pays roughly $6 or more to its riders, and still has to pay the hawker/restaurant, you can imagine the loss they must have incurred during this period of time. i believe the main reason behind this move was to take away market share from the other food delivery services like foodpanda and deliveroo, by undercutting their profits (most likely taking a loss like what happened with uber).so #1 we learnt that grab's food delivery arm in the singapore context has probably been incurring losses. and #2 is even if food deliveries see a spike, we must be reminded that grab as a whole is doing poorly in this period of time. i've got a friend who's a driver there and boy, there are legit no passengers at all. and that means less profits for grab too, in the area in which they rely on most.in response to this, they've allowed drivers to too deliver food, which in turn increases the supply of people delivering food, and as you've mentioned... supply & demand. so yeah, i believe these wage reducing measures were already bound to happen, and the current covid crisis might have simply expedited the process. ps. not a grab staff. actually do not like grab (felt their price cutting measures were too mean for my lack of business acumen mind) as i used to ride for food panda but i thought an objective opinion should be shared. on a more important note - stay safe and sane, everyone!",Positive
wth? can any riders from other food delivery companies chime in if you guys are facing similar issues?,Negative
"oh dear. and to think that the company has been putting themselves out publicly in the media as a firm that cares for their riders/drivers/partners.ever since the ban on e-scooters, i’ve been giving small tokens of appreciation like a chocolate/snack bar or a packet drink to all my delivery riders. it’s not much, but just a small way to say thanks and cheer y’all on for continuing to provide us consumers with this much-needed service despite the trying times.hang in there, op! 💪🏻 and, thank you for your service! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",Negative
"grab is actually losing money on a per-order basis, (as are deliveroo and foodpanda)so the increase in demand is actually going to kill all 3 companies. the current market is unsustainable. government is probably going to have to put some more money into keeping the services afloat during this period.",Positive
"i really think it’s high time singapore does something to revamp the entire food delivery system. we are so far behind compared to china (i’m not being biased or bootlicking, it comes from experience because i am studying in shanghai). in china, there are 2 apps available: eleme 饿了么 and meituan 美团, and taking out food using these apps is considered the norm. delivery is cheap and fast and there is a wide variety of food available, with frequent discounts and membership offers. the differences between how sg and china operate the system are probably due to the fact that our deliverymen are not as mobile compared to chinese ones, chinese riders usually use large e-scooters we call 电瓶车 which is like an electronic motorbike but far more convenient and speedy. given that our traffic conditions don’t allow for proper bike lanes and such e-scooters are quite dangerous, the speed of our deliverymen gets affected. also we just don’t have so many riders compared to china. and while supermarket delivery is the norm in china, the apps also offer medicine/flowers/immediate parcel delivery services. i think there’s so much more to be learnt and revamped on the sg side, it shocks me to see that all the problems still exist till now even though grab, deliveroo and foodpanda have been here for some time alr. i get that the situation in both countries definitely differ, but i still gape at the exorbitant price that doesn’t translate to riders’ wages and smooth wide coverage of services.",Positive
"grabfood stopped giving discounts a long time ago and so has my need to press on the app. i would suggest everyone to support foodpanda and deliveroo instead, they have better discounts and coupons.",Positive

"tried grabfood as a mirco time job between uni, its otot nature was pretty good for me, started in july, felt like during that time it was pretty fair, but as time goes on i've noticed incentives were completely dropped or halved.their driver support is 50/50, sometime you luck out get the support/compensation you need,  sometimes they tell you tough luck. their payout, i guess on weekends are decent, above the standard $10/h ranging about $15 onwards but it has been reduced every few months i noticed, another draw back is your work hours is limited to when people are looking for food (lunch/dinner). i agree it's not the nicest job to have, but i'm of the opinion it shouldn't be your full time job, just something to earn some change while looking for a job or while schooling. however, met drivers that relys on grab/panda, felt they always get screwed the most.",Positive
"you are assuming that the unit economics is positive, which i don't think it is. without that a record revenue is a record loss. growing revenue without positive unit economics is still acceptable is a good economy (banks are willing to lend and money can be raised by showing growth). since future funding might be uncertain now, grab would need to be more careful about burning its current funds. the adjustments are just grab trying to make the unit economics less negative, reducing the burn rate. it doesn't look like it, but if they are running on negative unit economics, then they are indeed being responsible to the riders by doing this, rather than risk going out of business because they couldn't raise the money to continue.",Negative

"hi everyone, thanks for all the responses! very heartened to see the care for our rider community. i'll address some of the more popular queries here:- who treats their partners better?i have accounts with grabfood and deliveroo, and my close friend works for foodpanda, so here's what i know:foodpanda - fixed rate for deliveries, and the rate is quite fair (not the highest though) considering that your rider doesn't know your address until they've picked up your food (similar to uber back in those days) - can be a good thing, can be a bad thing. but foodpanda dispatch is atrocious - if you thought their customer-facing support channels were bad, wait till you see their rider support. my friend had a job cancelled a week ago by accident after calling rider support to ask for cash reimbursement (customer made a cash order but noshow). rider support still hasn't reimbursed him the trip fare or the cash portion of the food. their tiering system also pits riders against each other - highest tier riders get paid more and can book slots early.deliveroo - by far the best company, if only they had better demand. trips are more fairly compensated (they add our journey to the restaurant as part of the fare, grab doesn't pay for distance to restaurant). rider support is generally more friendly and knows what's going on. policies are more reasonable. but their demand is trash - where i live, i can turn on deliveroo for an entire day and get crickets.grab - their flexibility is a huge bonus compared to the other 2. things used to be good, getting worse by the day. one more incident comes to mind - they tried to get unsuspecting riders to ""upgrade"" their cash wallet, and when those riders cashed out, their earnings went into their grabpay account (the one on the consumer app), not their bank account. just like that, hard-earned money stuck with grab. absolutely scummy move in my opinion- on grab's balance sheet issues.no doubt grab is still making losses, but that isn't really my point. for a company that keeps putting out pr on helping partners and the community and all, i'm surprised they never thought about the optics of cutting rider pay during this time. if this was done any other time (pre-covid), i don't think it would be such a problem. but in a time when grab is actively trying to champion riders and drivers as ""essential to our community"" their act of lowering pay sure runs against that messaging.it's telling to know that i'm not the only rider/driver/employee under grab who feels this way. hopefully they'll do something about it eventually.keep the comments coming, and stay safe y'all!edit: if you're comfortable going out to dabao, do consider paying your neighborhood hawkers a visit! buying directly from them means they earn more (cos no need to pay delivery commissions). help keep them open during these tough times!",Positive
"sorry to hear. this is literally why we need unions that aren’t a joke, bc this is how capitalism works.",Negative
look at my past post you'll see me ranting on grab before. the company is a shadow of itself after beating off uber and establishing itself here in singapore. the company has to make money but they are squeezing the wrong side of the balance. the drivers and food deliver people who are the backbone of the services are being strangled and soon the camel back will break. failure to see this is mind boggling. it's quite sad to see a fall from grace like this and all i could do when using the app is tip the drivers and delivery person. unfortunately it isn't enough,Negative

"being a grab driver, i’ve understood so well how they work. their pr is always to benefit the community. their tactic is always to throw money to lowball their competitors away. when given the chance to monopolise, the first group of ppl to cut is their drivers. in this case riders. once upon a time, drivers pay 20% commissions to drivers. but suddenly, if u pick and choose, drivers need to pay 30%. do again, pay 40%. it was the biggest outcry done by drivers. cos it goes against the concept of us being their partners. we do the job, we pay 20%. that should be it. this is veering towards modern slavery. after that feeble attempt and also me being banned on their platform, they reversed on that change. and can you believe it, i was banned for being vocal about it. so for riders, it’s simple, stop supporting grab. those ordering food, stop ordering from grab. now, here’s the next problem. ppl need money. some don’t care about all these principles. though some riders will stop using grab, many others will still do it. and that’s why grab will still keep on growing bigger and bigger. cut the pay, and still ppl do. kpk, still got ppl do. they learn from their experiences in dealing with singapore drivers. that’s why they make subtle changes. this won’t be the end. it will keep changing to benefit them until they can make money off riders and their customers. and that’s their end games. customers having no choice to buy through them. and riders having no choice but to be their slaves.",Neutral

"question for op:'* without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ gf?* has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to covid?* has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $x per week on average, now u earn $y on averageconsidering right now 3 low level moving parts in this business (gf):* rider (no issue on supply, if you don't want to do someone else will based on current market conditions)* restaurant (business heavily impacted due to takeaway only, earnings 50% or even lower currently before 7/4 dine in ban)* customer (increasing in order, ideally order volume grows in tandem to supply growth for motor vehicles)the platform will definitely try its best not to ""temp offline"" due to supply shortages as it impacts restaurants ability to receive orders and further impact their earnings, which results in less money from commissions to sustain it's supply base.currently out of the 3 parts mentioned above, riders have the most bandwidth in terms of stretching to ensure sustainability of the food delivery ecosystem in which many restaurants will be forced to shut down earlier if pressure is not alleviated on their end.* platform needs to be sustainable for restaurants to get orders* restaurants as of today definitely need orders/ delivery else no need for riders or platform if it goes belly up* riders are the commodity needed to deliver the foodsucks that riders get the short end of the stick here, but as consumers have you ordered from d'roo/ foodpanda? competition only occurs when customers allow it to happen by supporting the other players in the market.",Negative

"basically this. similar to many businesses, companies are cutting costs on areas that generate the main bulk of revenue on them, whether be it reduced/same/increased levels of profit so that they can use it to cover for the ailing side of the business. an example would be a hotel my friend is working at. he works at the bar in the hotel. business is booming since covid, but due to the hotel occupancy rate taking a huge hit; they cut their part timers off even though the number of customers coming in has increased. it’s the same for grab, when i converse with the drivers once in a while, they told me that they are barely covering the costs of car rental, let alone making ends meet even before the circuit breaker.also, they realised that even with the increase in demand in orders, they can cut the earnings from their riders simply because too many people just want to get a job at this point with low demands from them.the combination of both would mean that there’s no reason why any businesses facing this would not act the same way as grab, especially when they operate under the venture capitalist model.",Negative

"not op, but am part time/weekend grab cyclist for grabfood.*- without incentives/ reduction of distances will you still consider delivering food w/ gf?*unfortunately yes, because it is tough to find a job that grants this amount of flexiblity. the pay is not the best - but incentives really pushed you to do more orders and distances being >4km is a major gripe for me. fucked up my knees doing all those uphill end of the world orders. - *has any restaurant partner shared if their comm structure have decreased due to covid?*no contact with restaurant partners - communications and price setting between them and grab i believe are on an individual agreement basis. someone more informed can correct me.- *has the increased distance of delivery affected your earnings eg: before distance increase u earn $x per week on average, now u earn $y on average*yes, on average the payout is about 10 dollars lesser a day. (short) orders that used to pay a minimum of 5 now pay about 4.5. (long) orders that used to pay ~6.5 now pay about 5.9/6. this multiplied by 12 and reduction of incentives ($10 for 12 deliveries) makes us lose about ~$20 a day from the changes. imagine working full time, this is significant (20*30 assuming working whole month at *minimum* orders is 600 dollars dip in earnings.",Positive
"quite an appropriate flair considering your questions haha1. incentives make up a large part of our pay (i'd daresay more than 30% based on my earnings), so if grab completely removes incentives without raising base pay, i suspect there'll be a exodus of riders. as for distance reductions, it's really a suck thumb thing for us - damned if we do (customer complain food cold), damned if we don't (incentives affected).2. i haven't heard any restaurant mention decreased comms.3. because our incentives are for per delivery, if i have to travel longer and take longer for each delivery, pay will definitely drop because the increase in base pay from the distance can never cover for the decreased incentive payout.",Negative

"the thing is, in the instance for grab, hailing services generate the main bulk of their income. of course they do cut as much costs they can from it, but there is a limit to how much you can cut, and given the current situation in singapore, they are still facing losses/massive losses. to mitigate some of the losses, there’s where food delivery comes in.right now, they are not at a stage where they can aggressively expand market share due to losses incurred. given the current situation, maintaining status quo on the customer side, given the increasing reliance on food delivery would mean they are generating more revenue without the need to do anything at all. thus comes cost cutting.when they decide to lower incentives and potential income for riders, would it mean that they would face a shortage in riders? with the current job situation in singapore, many people are swarming into transport(grab, taxi) and food delivery sectors. however, the current group of transport drivers are barely covering costs in the first place, thus grab has stopped accepting new grab drivers, let alone people not even wanting to enter the industry due to minimal income/potential losses, thus most people are trying to enter food delivery now. even with reduced incentives, there are more potential riders available right now. thus they can afford to save costs, yet be able to retain enough riders to cope with increased demand. thus it would be a sensible approach to cut costs in the area they are profiting from since it won’t/will barely cause any drop in revenue at all.",Positive

"grabfood rider here.what your dad experienced isn't new, but i believe it has never occured at this magnitude before. grabfood riders have gotten accustomed to the fact that we'll be made to wait at restaurants. a few restaurants are notorious for their long wait times - chinese casual restaurants (e.g. dtf, paradise group, crystal jade), zichar and western casual restaurants (i'm looking at you collin's and pizza hut). some other restaurants that come to mind are jollibee and srisun. some delays are completely understandable - an order with 15 items or some dish that needs to be made from scratch. in fact most riders are pretty okay with waiting a reasonable amount of time, and it helps when the restaurant communicates to us so we can update the customer. but if i'm waiting there as a rider for 1 prata and you're telling me the wait time is 30min when there's literally no one else in your restaurant, something isn't quite right la (yes this has happened to me before). likewise here, 1h+ is definitely unacceptable for the customer and the rider.to grab management:this is what happens when you try to shoehorn food delivery into an app designed to assign private hire jobs - you fail to account for the fact that food needs time to be prepared, whereas a passenger doesn't need much time to meet their driver. as a result there isn't any buffer built between assignment to the rider and assignment to the restaurant. in fact, here's the truth - when your grabfood app tells you ""the merchant is preparing your order, we'll find you a rider soon"", your merchant actually hasn't received the order and hasn't started preparing your food, because grab needs to assign the order to a rider first before pushing it to the merchant, meaning the rider receives the order before the merchant. that's why i've stepped into some restaurants before and called out my grabfood order number only to have merchants be taken aback and telling me ""the order literally just got printed out of the device"".in fact, back in the days when grabfood and grabfood driver were separate apps from the rest of the grab ecosystem, restaurants would get the order first and they could select how long it would take them to prepare the order (up to a buffer of 30min i believe) and when the buffer time is almost up, grab would find a rider to pick up the order. somewhat like the system foodpanda and deliveroo use.but now grab doesn't care, because they'd rather make their riders wait for the food than to have merchants saying their food is getting cold waiting for a rider - you as the restaurant can always store the food somewhere temperature-appropriate, but we the riders can't be helping you cook your food.if the old restaurant selecting their prep time system existed today on grabfood, this dtf clusterf*** would've never happened. but i guess grab just can't give enough of a shit to us riders and our time to actually implement it.",Negative
as a delivery rider i can confirm that dtf at nex has always been a little slow with order preps. and now with the telegram chat (for riders) removed it’s actually very difficult to ask for compensation and request for assistance from grab,Negative
ordered from dtf nex today and the order took forever. tipped the delivery uncle $10 due to the heavy rain but in the midst of collecting and thanking me he mumbled something about how shitty dtf is. reading this makes me feel even more fucking glad i tipped him.,Positive
wall of text but i'm a rider as well.. i feel yarestaurants like that are ones to avoid next time u get an order.although pre-covid they were that ones who prioritized walk-ins first,Positive
grab has really got to put more resources into customer service during this period (both delivery riders/drivers and consumers). i still see them as profiteering by increasing delivery and platform fees.,Positive
"wife and myself have been ordering grab quite frequently for some timebe nice to these delivery guys - it's not easy for them too. especially since they are taking a risk by going to malls/ hawker centres to collect your food. just a few things we as customers or users of the app can do:stop hounding the helpline- asking why is your food taking so long, why is your food cold, etc. i'd imagine that more often than not, it is out of the delivery rider's control.we have a little stool outside our condo unit - for them to put the food on, so w don't have to make human contact. also tipped all my deliveries 1-3 bucks (not much i know). send a thank you message when the rider is on the way.",Negative
"not sure if the store was too busy to temporarily close the status of the store delivery when there was already so much. i remembered last time at my work, unlike foodpanda and deliveroo the grabfood app doesn't allow the store to reject orders unless you close the menu or store hours. also, glitch sometimes happen. we have closed the fp delivery status  before and even shutdown the phone, to our surprise a deliveryrider appeared and on his phone, it showed that the order was accepted. switch on the phone to confirm and it did appear. though it was not our fault, felt really bad when we had to tell him about the glitch and that the food item was also sold out already. the order was also quite a sum from what i remember. it was sad to see the weak smile the deliveryman gave after hearing us. i hope that things will get better for both sides, the staff who have to monitor the delivery and the deliveryman who are collecting the orders.",Negative
upvoted to let more people see this. was the amount fair for the 2.5 hours wasted?,Positive
"this feels like it can be a technical fix, all orders not fulfilled by the restaurant within 40 mins should be automatically cancelled.",Neutral
"this is an unfortunate situation and i feel bad for your dad. appreciate him doing his best to work at this tough period. kudos to him.circling back i agree with your point that everyone has some responsibility here.**customers** \- should try to be more patient and appreciative of what these delivery riders are doing for them albeit at a cost/fee.**grab** \- probably takes the most blame because of the poor management and how stingy they are when it comes to compensation as well as support for this entire process. compensation is well and good but $4 for waits upwards of 2hrs? that's pathetic.just to put things into perspective but foodpanda has managed this much better. whenever a certain store hit a ceiling of orders, foodpanda automatically flags the shop as closed to stop taking orders. this way, restaurants are not swamped with orders whilst customers still get their food in a reasonable time. **this is the way it should be done. learn from them grab.****restaurants** \- benefit of doubt that they have no idea how much demand their promotions will cause resulting in manpower shortage. no excuses though to be understaffed and not communication to the riders earlier.",Positive
did not expect myself to tear up reading this.  this read is a good reminder for myself that many of us are having a much harder time right now and we should be more understanding towards each other. workers on the ground always face the blunt impact of poor planning.,Positive

"the same thing happened to my dad as well, he went to collect food at this restaurant but ended up waiting over an hour, along with other grabfood drivers. he also mentioned that the restaurant prioritises dine in customers to the point that people finished their meal and left and he still hasnt gotten his delivery food. its kinda irresponsible and selfish cuz ur wasting peoples time and now with this shitty income u cant earn much a day. if ur not gonna entertain deliveries just dont register ur restaurant on grabfood please",Negative
"tbh i'm not surprised about this at all. dtf is under royal t and honestly speaking, the company has some serious management issues. i used to work at liho during my school holidays and even back then without the circuit breaker, things have already been quite messy. anyway, from what i can tell as well, most outlets under the company are being overworked and are paid peanuts for their hardwork. quite sad, really, to see that this is how employees are treated, especially during this chaotic period.",Negative
"that sucks, i'm sorry your dad had to go through that. delivery drivers always work super hard and i'm so grateful they're still out there doing their thing during this time. it's quite understandable that things will take longer time during this lockdown, and i always try to at least be polite and kind to delivery drivers when they bring my stuff (and not complain if things take a while or food isn't hot-- i have a microwave for a reason!) there isn't much else i can do but hopefully that's something.",Positive
bloody grab and the merchant management issues. leaving the customers pissed and delivery people out to be hung dry. i commented [a little](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/emmoatv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about their stupid practices a while ago. can't say i'm surprised such issues are happening. there need to be stronger regulations for such platforms to ensure that any merchants with them must be able to show that they have the capability to fulfil the orders before they take them. with you in solidarity op.  anyone with half a brain cell should know better than to blame delivery riders for this mess.,Positive
"i was at burger king at amk the other day, same problem but instead of takeaway customers getting their food first, its the delivery people. i had to wait for a $5 meal for 30-40 minutes + 10 minutes additional to wait for the people to take my order. fast food my ass.i dont understand the rationale???, why would you have a restaurant that has takeaway orders as well as delivery orders and understaff them?? the higher management are like deliberately trying to make the 5-10 staff that are working in burger king (no exaggeration, there was no cashier at the bk counter and 1 person was doing all the burger petty while the manager and another guy was doing the burgers and 1 person was just doing drinks..) more stressed as there's no way they can cope with the amount of orders consistently flowing in.. there was a china lady and another customer who were with me but they had been there way before me and had already ordered and somehow, my food was first... and they apparently told the china lady and the other customer that they ""forgot"" their orders.. lol.. yeah everyone is having really bad experiences.. i feel you op",Positive

"this is what is happening at every restaurant. not only din tai fung.grab is pushing out the orders since they introduced islandwide delivery. which is causing more havoc at restaurants cos a lot of them are either understaffed or not ready for the influx of orders.in the end, during peak hrs, u end up waiting at least 30-45min to collect 1 order.grab shld really put a limit to how many orders a restaurant can take or a restaurant shld have a limit.i went to putien at kitchener. the table literally had like 15 orders with only 1-2 orders coming out od the kitchen every 10-15min. by the time they settled that 2. another 5 orders were on the table.so its really messy and unorganised and affects our earnings cos u can only do much.if u cancel the order on the delivery rider end, it affects ur rating and u either get very far pickups/drop offs or u get no orders due to the oversupply of drivers/riders around.so yes. this is what is happening outside.",Positive

"restaurants has the full control all of the orders coming. they can either choose if they want to put auto accept or manual accept order, in this case it seems they put it in auto accept. also restaurant can put it on busy mode or simply just close it, some restaurants don't do this because it will affect your visibility, if you always in busy mode, grab/deliveroo will automatically put you below the list.i say, it's entirely the fault of the restaurant for putting a promo but cutting labor cost. as well as not controlling their orders or cancelling it themselves.",Negative

"a few tips for grab & ding tai fung,1. riders/drivers earn a living. having no **incentives** and waiting more than 30 mins lowers income by -$15 (eg $25-15=$10). 2. **timing**. many riders are out early everyday working more than 12hrs. every hr counts, if grab and shops dont recognise it soon, they're gng to lose substantial business to competitors in the long run. 3. drivers/riders **costs** are either affected by petrol or by hrs cycling to and fro between locations. even tho they may save energy or petrol, there is no income for idle time. 4. becos of **covid-19**, many have chosen grabfood and are trying to make some income to tide thru smaller bills. incentives help riders/drivers, with more perks there'll be more people to help with the orders.5. lastly, **restaurants**. please give some thought to the people picking up food, they're actually yr colleagues from operations. if you don't treat them nicely, they could be the ones advising customers to place future orders elsewhere.  think abt that, yr marketing efforts could so easily be improved these guys on the ground. if you didn't get any of these then i have a strong suggestion, go do delivery for 2 weeks - you'll learn a great deal there and know first hand how tough it is in this isolated environment👌",Positive

"i mean there’s many way to look at it. if you are just talking about the customer who bought the food (either delivery or on the spot), then defo delivery customers should be waiting longer. but the reality is that there are delivery riders who are not paid an hourly wage. if the merchant delays by a little, say 20-30 mins it’s still bearable, but 1.5 hours? how is that justifiable? you can’t possibly keep bringing in orders when you are unable to cope in the kitchen, so better to just stop service altogether temporarily rather that keep everyone waiting. not doing that until almost an hour later is horrid because that means the delivery rider is going to earn only that much for the time he has waited, because they are not paid by the hours they work, but by the amount they deliver. if all merchants decide to prioritise on the spot takeaways, riders are going to earn pittance.better to balance both delivery and takeaway orders by the time they are ordered, and if you find you cannot cope with both, just turn off the app. or hire more workers so you wouldn’t have to encounter this problem at all",Positive

"to be fair to the staff there, din tai fung hasn't been on grab for a long time (prolly about a month?) and this was their first ever promo so they'll definitely be bombarded by orders. can't blame them for not really being sure how to handle the load. but management is definitely at fault for the lack of foresight and training - if they can't handle the load, they should've been taught how to go offline.",Positive
"from what i know from my colleague, he has relatives and friends working in din tai fung.when covid 19 was starting to rise in sg and the travel ban for tourist was issued, din tai fung actually retrenched alot of their staff, both foh and boh.my colleague brother was one of them.now they come out with promo and they cant handle it because they are already on very low manpower.but who can they blame but blame themselves",Positive
"sounds like management issues with dtf. i mean, as a chef, if the restaurant manager cant organize the orders being accepted, what for accept new orders? they should also be accountable for waiting times both takeaway and deliveries.",Negative
hmm seems like they need to familiarize with the app cos i think they have the options to stop accepting orders through the apps. have restaurants near my house showing 'unavailable for delivery now' during rainy days too when they are usually open. hope they work this out soon.,Negative
"yeah the grabfood merchant device is riddled with lots of issues, i've had to help multiple merchants troubleshoot their device to get orders to come in on time. grab never bothered setting it up properly to begin with - for many merchants their device would go to sleep after a minute and stop receiving any orders unless they manually woke it up, which ofc they wouldn't do unless a rider shows up.",Positive
"it's not like riders have a choice though - reject/cancel an order just because the restaurant is hella slow and our ability to receive incentives is jeopardized, even more so with grab tightening restrictions on how many orders we can cancel/reject before we become ineligible for incentives.",Positive
they used to have a tele chat like one on one rider to helpline but ever since the covid they removed it so now you’ll have to call in or use the beta chat on the grab app itself which tbh its quite bad,Negative
"it's very admirable to hear about your dad's attitude! rarely are there riders who'll accept every order they receive (i'm part of the majority 😁)you can reassure your dad that a single cancellation or rejection does not land him in any blacklist of any sort! only multiple consecutive cancellations will result in a penalty.wishing your dad all the best, and a warm welcome to the grabfood community!",Positive
"nah it's all right to avoid constant long wait time from a vendor. the wait times must be reasonable since the delivery gus has to answer to both company and customer.also, if he feels like if the order will take a very long waiting time after reconfirming with the shop staff, he can try calling grabfood hotline requesting for further actions.",Positive
"same, was just wondering this, and we typically pass the driver the tip in cash (from my experience ordering food in america there are some really unscrupulous companies who were rumored to pocket part of the driver’s tip) rather than adding on in the app itself. but i’m glad to hear this. :)",Positive
really? sorry if i informed wrongly. i just think it's the same as deliveroo.,Negative

thank you! that's great to know!,Positive
u have to factor in the time it took to get there. if not people who place an order on their phone will get an order in first.,Positive
"i empathise with ur dad’s circumstance, but honestly i think you’re laying the blame on the merchant a bit thick. from ur account i don’t see any malice from the merchant’s end - they r likely swamped, under strength and perhaps inexperienced (hence did not turn off the app). frankly surprised that there’s so little empathy for the kitchen staff who were probably stretched to their limit during the lunch hour today. not to mention they probably had to deal with very angry grab riders too. i’m not surprised that the kitchen is understrength - they may have imposed a quota on the number of people who can work in the kitchen as a covid safety measure. it’s been happening in hawker stalls in food courts too. the solution is not so easy or straightforward like what u r suggesting. and there’s a very flawed premise in ur post. “if all merchants decide to prioritise on the spot takeaways, riders are going to earn a pittance”. it is absolutely logical that merchants would prioritise serving customers who have appeared in person to make their orders. furthermore, these merchants don’t owe grab riders a living. it’s the grab company and the paying customers who determine the riders’ income. from my pov, the sensible grab rider would have cancelled the orders and just feedbacked to the customers to get food from another place. the grab riders have a choice whether or not they want to stay there and waste away their potential income for the time they spent waiting. quite ridiculous to blame others for “lost opportunity cost” imho.",Negative
my goodness. that is terrible. get penalized for doing ur job.,Negative
"eh isalrite, we all gotta start from somewhere haha. if anything, blame grab for keeping this quiet the whole time and having new riders find out from old birds.",Positive
"i don't blame them too, being one of the understaffed workers is no joke. i once worked in ichiban boshi and one time all the chefs went on break (it was non peak hour) and no one was there to make the food or drinks, the manager was not there too. me being just a food runner working on my second day had no fucking clue what to do and had to take shit from the customers because they couldn't get their food on time. it was absolute dogshit.and this lasted only a few hours, i can't imagine how difficult it is like for these people to handle their job for the entire day.",Negative
"still doesn't quite explain how some rider their order one show up and the other went holland. in the end,  really is suck thumb for both side sia. the grab representative i remember they just hand us the device tell us exchange and that's it.end up, we just probably assumed that it is just plug and play type.",Positive
"yeah, hope an internal chat group opens up for the riders where they can consolidate their experiences, in hopes to deter riders from accepting orders from merchants who bites off more than they can clearly chew.",Positive

"quite a lot of assumptions but i’ll address them one by one.first, at no point in my post did i blame the kitchen or service crew. i even admitted that these people were even overworked and i knew what it feels like as i was working f&b part time until recently. what i did blame was the management or whoever decided it was a good idea to do a promo, with less than the amount of regular staffs, and still serving customers ordering on the spot at the same time. at plenty of instances, even before the half hour mark, many riders communicated, both to the restaurant and grab, to stop accepting new orders until the current orders were satisfied, which went unheeded. all that resulted was some back and forth as the restaurant called grab and vice versa multiple times talking about god knows what as the orders kept coming in and riders kept arriving too. of course i understand that there might be regulations limiting staffs, but it’s the management to come up with a contingency plan to cope for an increase in demand, not the riders, isn’t it. and if you fail to plan properly, should you not be responsible for whatever shitshow happens next? this is din tai fung we are talking about, not some random cafes new to grabfood, and even if working crews were inexperienced, surely the management would be familiar and know that making a promo results in increased demand (i doubt this is their first promo). if they failed to plan for this then the onus is on them. secondly, there are issues with cancelling. sure, they can be rectified, but do you know the average wait time for support staffs? riders are expected to report things as soon as he can, and if he spends an entire hour calling, the time he waste will be the same as the time he spends waiting at dtf. unless you get verbal assurance from the support staff, no driver would want to forfeit their earning when they are already at a place and have incurred some costs (even if not time, parking maybe)and besides, if dtf clearly communicated on the waiting time, it would be more reasonable to expect drivers to cancel. you can’t keep waffling on an arbitrary number; first they said 30 mins, then they kept extending minutes by minutes, and until 1.5 hrs later cancelled all orders. how are drivers supposed to advice their customers accurately on the waiting time. some customers were still willing to wait for 30 mins, but certainly not 1.5 hours. how bad does it look when initially the driver say 30 mins waiting time as per the restaurant’a instructions, and then having to call them back and keep changing every few moments later? i understand dtf does not have a responsibility paying delivery drivers, but since everyone is working together, it would only be socially responsible to give accurate updates so both customers and riders can both plan for the situation. if you can’t handle just be honest and say you can’t handle, instead of putting a front. fyi, my dad was lucky he left after 1.5 hours, because he could speak chinese to the chinese speaking staff. there were many malay abangs who were absolutely clueless because there was no communication to them whatsoever on whatever was happening so they stayed even later than him.",Positive
"it's not right for merchants to prioritize walk-in customers just because they're physically there. they're supposed to be completing orders in the sequence they receive them. look at any fast food restaurant and they way they operate deliveries.delivery customers are ultimately customers. if you make the rider wait, the rider will tell the customer that the restaurant is making them wait. the delivery customer starts wondering why this restaurant is taking so long. customer decides to never order from the restaurant again. restaurant has lost a customer.and it's not like grab riders can just cancel orders as and when we feel like it. if every merchant pulls this on riders and we have to keep cancelling, we become ineligible for incentives. the merchant's problem then becomes our problem in lost income. it's not a simple game of ""cancel and the next merchant will definitely be fast"" - next merchant could be equally slow, or worse, next order could be from the same merchant, and you just end up wasting even more time. maybe next time you should strike up a conversation with a rider and actually understand what the process and situation is like before assuming we can ""have a choice whether or not they want to stay there and waste away their potential income for the time they spent waiting"" because we don't have that choice.and yes op is right, the rider support line is frequently jammed with wait times well in excess of 30min. with this dtf shitshow happening across the island, riders might as well wait it out because who knows if they'll ever get to speak to a dispatcher.and it's not like if we cancel the order gets cancelled on the customer's end. it just ends up floating to another rider who's gonna go to the restaurant and discover the shitshow and cancel, and the cycle goes on and on and on.no one is blaming the kitchen or the wait staff - it's the fault of management for refusing to go offline when overwhelmed with orders.",Neutral

"> it's not right for merchants to prioritize walk-in customers just because they're physically there.  from my experience working in service positions, i can tell u that i would be much more pressured to answer immediately to the angry and inpatient customer who is there in person, rather than the delivery guy who's sitting around scrolling his phone 90% of the time. it's really not a matter of right or wrong or principles; it is a very simple psychological effect. >customer decides to never order from the restaurant again. restaurant has lost a customer. right and you’ve already answered your own question. it is very very unlikely that every single merchant faced by a food delivery guy will be so inefficient - because it will hurt their profits too. so your argument about next merchant being equally slow whatsoever, moot. ~~the problem is op’s dad did not choose to cancel and move on when op explicitly mentioned that a number of other riders did - in that case, he made the choice to wait that 2.5hr, the “lost opportunity cost” is his to bear. i also don’t think any customer would actually want to wait 2.5hr for their lunch, even if it is from dtf. but idk, don’t see op addressing this in his post.~~ edit: op has clarified that his dad was repeatedly given false assurances that the food would be out soon and all that, so i understand why he did not move on and stand corrected.secondly, is it not possible for the rider to just communicate the situation to the customer so that the order doesn’t get recycled to the next rider? so that the customer can make alternative plans? if you, as a grab rider, cancel ur order and don’t bother to communicate the situation to the unknowing customer then i think u r part of the problem. it is highly unlikely that the customer would insist on waiting 2.5hr for their lunch.thirdly, you’re putting yourself into a false dilemma here. you always have a choice. i note that you mentioned the trade off for moving on to the next customer is “what if the next merchant is slow ... will affect our incentives”. like i said, it is not certain that the next merchant will be slow and secondly, it’s not like there are procedural issues barring u from moving on to the next order. you can, perhaps at the risk of making less in terms of incentives. there’s no either or situation here. and i don’t take kindly to your implying that i’m ignorant because (you assume) i haven’t spoken to a grab rider before. this is a platform for people to speak their minds. we don't all need to be experts or delivery guys to comment on op's post.",Positive
ah i see thx,Neutral
"just to clarify, 2.5 hours is the total time my dad spent to resolve this issue. he only waited 1.5 hours at the restaurant, while receiving 1/3 of his orders and proceeded to deliver the only order. however, according to him, because the merchant side did not cancel the order (even though they said they could no cope), his app was stuck on the pending offer, for which he could neither go forwards nor backwards. it also meant he could no longer take up new jobs and there was no option to cancel. other drivers probably could as they only had one order; my dad collected 1/3 orders so he couldn’t go back. he had to drive to the grab hq (after failing to contact support) in order for them to reset his app, wasting even more time, for which the total amount of time spent was around 2.5 hours. hope this clarifies!also i asked him why didn’t he just reject when he was there before the first order was given to him. he told me he didn’t want the order to get passed on to another unsuspecting grabfood driver who may be older and weaker than he is. initially he called the customers who still wanted to wait when the waiting time was stipulated to be 30 mins, so he waited with them, unfortunately it did not turn out that way:(",Negative
"you should really try food delivery for a couple days cos you really don't seem to understand what it's really like.psychological effect yes i agree. but would you rather i as the rider tell the customer ""the restaurant has decided to prioritize walk ins over your order so be prepared to wait over an hour for your food"" or would you rather tell the walk in customer ""sorry we're preparing food in the sequence we receive orders and there's lots of delivery orders ahead of yours"" which if you're a sensible wait staff you would've already told the walk-in customer before they started ordering unless you want the customer to be angry at you later.yes, every single restaurant is jammed during peak hours. trust me, you can ask any rider and they'll tell you 90% of merchants make you wait during peak hours. and yes, if there's really that many people ordering dtf, i could cancel one dtf order and the next order that jumps out is another dtf order. once again, ask any rider.no, the customer cannot cancel the order once a rider has accepted it. no, the rider also cannot cancel the order for the customer. the only people who can do that is the hotline. and if a shitshow like this is going on, you can be guaranteed the hotline will be slammed. no one's gonna get through without ridiculous wait times. so the order can't get cancelled. i can inform the customer all right, but they can't cancel, i can't cancel, then what? the customer can order the another meal yea sure, but the rider can't cancel, so he can't move on to another job y'know? that's lost income. and self-cancellations affect our eligibility for incentives. and self-cancellations just result in the order being assigned to another rider who'll repeat the cycle. once again, ask any rider.while there sure aren't any procedural issues stopping us from cancelling the order on our end, would you, as an employee, be willing to take a pay cut because someone else fucked up? i bet not. same logic here. restaurant messed up by taking more than they could handle, so why should i as the rider risk losing my incentive because the restaurant messed up? it's not a false dilemma when you're actually put in the situation of deciding whether to cancel and move to the next order to get 20 bucks or lose an incentive worth over 50. once again, ask any rider.you're entitled to your opinion here, but what you've said indicates your obvious lack of awareness and knowledge to what a food delivery rider's job is like. if you don't know what our side of the story is like, don't make assumptions on what we can or cannot do. sure you don't need to be an expert, so that's why there're riders here like me and others to tell people what it's like from our perspective.",Positive

"mci is like dementia-light. older people gets dementia, sometimes because of alzheimer's disease (ad) sometimes not because of dementia but we have no idea why, except ""they are old"". ad is a diagnosis, which requires, diagnostic tests: usually they look for amyloid beta, tau, things like that. it took 30 years of research for us to get to a point where we can know ad when we see it, aka, concrete diagnostic criteriawhy i say it's the last frontier. look at covid, many countries just crush it without drugs or vaccines. it took a year to develop a vaccine while with other earlier respiratory pandemics, it had to be burned out. we stopped sars, imperfectly.  we can deal with most infections fine and even then pandemics aren't as cripplingly terrible. covid isn't ebola-lethal, but people did predict the last ebola outbreak to burn out at 10 millions deaths. with very strong measures (search ""beyond contact tracing""), it was stopped at 4,000 deaths.we can deal with some cancer, if we catch it early enough. the real success of cancer is ""people live long enough to die of something else"" and with every day, cancer treatment advance a bit further.about dementia and ad, ... well the biggest risk factor is age. if you are above 80-85, you have 1 in 3 chance of catching ad. we aren't clear on the mechanism; like i said, it took 30 years just to be able to put into clinical practice concrete diagnosis criteria for ad. we have very few treatment options. it's your body quite literally running out of steam, energy, and life. infection didn't kill you, trauma didn't do it, you survived cancer and bam! your brain start falling apart. well, the current frontier is to stop your brain from slowly falling apart.that's a tall order. however, we got to this point because we have never lived so long before and it's an uncharted territory. that's real advancement for humanity that we have conquered so many lethal diseases.",Positive

"is it ""hence""? i do know about the partnership, and that seems to be why smrt has no app of it's own. i suppose they see that as a saving. but they have put the flow of bookings almost entirely into the hands of a competitor. they will only get scraps of the leftovers that grab can't handle themselves. and it's a really weak partnership that doesn't even have an option for grab pay for street hails.",Positive

i worked in singapore for a few months. i didn't have a net card for the first few days. and the only reason i knew i had to get one was because i lived on singapore prior (and coworkers told me to get one). from a foreigner's perspective it's quite surprising to see this kind of change.,Positive

nope. there aren’t that many good alternatives except comfort. even with the added $1 grab is way cheaper for  me than driving. if comfort can find a way to scalp money from me they’d be doing it too. it’s a business not a charity. anyone who thought they’d forever be getting vouchers is fucking dreaming and needs to wake up and understand how the world works.,Positive
not so simple lah. you probably need a few investors with deep pockets to start fighting on the ride hailing front.,Negative
"not so simple. the telecom operators are making huge profits as monopolies then. grab is still making huge losses based on the current prices which frankly is too low. even if there is competition, there is only so much prices can go down because grab is already unprofitable. the company will go bankrupt if they don’t increase price. at the end of the day, they exist to provide a service and make money at the same time. they do not exist to subsidise rides to perpetuity.",Positive
"the ride hailing app, grab included is not actually earning money right now and mostly depend on investor pumping in more capital.  if that happens all you're doing is force them to bankrupt faster. competition should be introduced when a single company has a monopoly and holding the consumer hostage but right now that monopoly isn't sustainable",Positive

"exactly, i agree. don't know why people kick up a huge fuss about it.not happy with fare increase = take public transport. simple.(unless you really cannot take public transport, then i feel your pain)",Positive
"if the cost of solving the problem is more than what the customer values it at, there is a problem. they lose money because they have high costs. these costs include the talent they hire at huge premiums, cost of providing esops to leaders and staff as well as subsidies they payout specifically to gather market share.as of right now, nobody except those privy to their inner working know how the losses are estimated and how costs are calculated. there are a lot of back door deals which take place specifically to appease investors. like grab consuming the services of companies which are also owned by their investors. for the sake of following the process a rfp exercise would be done but parameters are tweaked such that there are only those suitors left in the race. all companies do it. effectively cash is paid out to these companies and losses booked at grab.also the entire basis of calculating losses is what defines whether they are operational losses or paper losses. twitter till some time back also had losses because it was doling out bucketful of esops and that needs to be paid for.with grab it’s particularly convoluted because instead of doing a ipo where they would have make their inner workings public they chose the spac route where they don’t need to disclose much.also with the 1$ hike it’s a smart move. they may even give out the same 1$ back as a discount but remember the way it gets accounted is that it adds to the revenue (top line) first and then you reduce the operational cost of driver payouts and subsidies etc.illustration - if grab does 500k rides a day in sg for an average price of 6$ it gives it a top line of approx 1bn/year. now with covid their rides fall 30% so obviously the top line would be 700m. so they increase the price by 1$ which now puts the top line at 895m improving it by 30%. it’s irrelevant whether they are paying it to the driver or subsiding it. their only aim to show earnings which determine their valuation. that is also the reason you see a 30c insurance fee and maybe as they want to top line growth in the future they will keep adding more such charges, often taking them off as discounts later. discounts get charged as losses separately.right now grab has a race to show a certain revenue to get the best valuation and listing premium. after that they will rest easy!",Positive

what talking you. how are they the only one left? there are like 3 other competitors to grab,Negative
"right!! meanwhile people are getting paycut and grab wants to ""help drivers""to force riders to cough out that $1 forcibly tbh it isn't fair. there's already a tip options available, if those riders whom aren't affected by the economy and would like to do their part for drivers then by all means do tipping.",Positive
you’re being too optimistic. grab will quite likely end up taking 50% of the dollar.,Neutral
"right? it's just $1. if people think that it's too little, they can always tip the drivers since that one 100% guarantee chop it goes to them.   heck, even some bbt toppings costs more than $1 and people are willing to pay for that.",Positive
"i think it's fine too, to help them.",Positive

"goodness i thought i was the only one. i have experienced this multiple times too since 2 years ago when i first starting using the gojek app. the drivers will accept the job, and just stay idle at their current location. no response whatsoever when you message them. it's like they want to troll you on purpose, and make you wait there like a fool. also, not all the time, but i get a very weird uncomfortable/unfriendly vibe from most gojek drivers.there was one time they tried to lure me back using vouchers, when i tried to use it, it kept prompting me system error. i stopped using their service a some time ago.as much as i am pissed at grab for their constant opportunistic money grabbing, i must say their drivers are much better than gojek, most of time based on my personal experience.",Positive

grab wasn't a pioneer in this app booking technology. so consumers needs to be penalise for ease of technology. nice.you should start reading as to why grab is burning their cash and you'll understand their business model. their price isn't even cheap to begin with. we live in a fre market world. if grab is making a loss and then they should close shop n let others take over. comfort surprisingly is getting better in this. vote with your wallet,Positive

i tried tada a couple years ago but always found it difficult to find a driver. has it improved?,Negative
"+1 for tada! and yes, drivers get the full fare so they are generally less angsty which makes for a more pleasant ride!",Positive
while paying full fare to drivers is a good thing. they also have to make money to pay the staff that is behind all these. hopefully tada balance this out and make it a good service here in singapore.,Positive

nah you need to use it in their motherland that is america. that is where you can truly witness how fucked up the entire experience is. uber has been consistently at least usd5 more expensive than its other counterpart lyft even without any promos.  got off at grand central station in la after a 12hour train ride and the app could still ask me for the zip code as it could not detect my location. four homeless folks were hovering behind me and it was close to midnight. immediately deleted the app and used lyft for the rest of my trip.,Negative
"if i recall correctly, the first time i took an uber, i learnt the reason is because the driver won’t know what the route is until they accept the job. for grab, they are able to see the job, the route etc and then accept or reject.",Positive
there is gojek. but it's as expensive,Negative

"will take a read. tbh, im just shocked at the reaction by the public. we are undergoing inflation process anyway right. prices are bound to increase and grab isnt a charitable organization.",Negative
"but let’s put it this way, grab charges a premium because it is a tech platform which matches riders with drivers. that’s isn’t a particularly tough job and platforms like tada also do the same job. the reason why grab is investing so much is because it is also getting into other lines of business. remember the days when cdl and other taxis used to charge us 3$ to book a can because they were a monopoly!the actual cost of running a matching platform would ideally not exceed 30-50c per transaction which can be easily built on top of a base fare.",Positive
"it's not so much the $1 increase, but the absurd bullshit to spin it as it's for the drivers but caveat it to only a month.",Negative
"this is the problem and notoriously bad attitude with grab. they've lost the trust with their important stakeholder. i.e. customer. first with one sided 'delay charge', then the sudden devaluation of points, addl charges and what not. to rub salt to the wounds, the attitude of their customer care (especially during the uber days).. now the $1 is not for drivers but to make sure their margins / revenues remains",Positive
"grab will not be hurt as long as the drivers and consumers have no choice and continue to use them.  to have a real competitor, you need a lot of cash to displace them within a year.  they have a few billions of cash and can last 2-3 years without any revenue even.  the balance of power in the industry for the betterment of drivers and consumers can only happen with more effective regulation on labour and pricing.",Positive
actually my biggest pet peeve with grab is their ridiculous app. bloatware max with a ui designed by an adhd teenager on meth stuck in a mania-induced fever dream.worst app on my phone if not for the champion fave pay with their pop up ads when you are trying to scan to pay. 🤦🏻‍♂️,Negative
"they would have gone through all the simulations and found it to be better for their bottom line.i suspect there are not enough drivers to meet grab’s internal service kpis, so they want to discourage certain price-sensitive customers from booking, in favour of less price-sensitive customers.",Positive

no one is taking rides now as they're working from home. i notice gojek lowered their fees in the mornings. grab adding $1 seems counter productive since demand is low,Neutral
grab must be counting on it’s superapp features and brand recognition to carry this through. by price alone grab is already not competitive. i just did a quick price comparison for my most frequent route (holland road to begonia) and grab is the most expensive (16 vs comfort 15 and gojek 13).,Positive

short answer: yes.especially now when everyone is suffering.,Neutral

deleted the app ever since they announced the $1 increase. need to boycott such blood sucking companies.,Neutral

exactly. leaves a bad taste for those who see past their bullshit.. grab is still a loss making company desperate to keep their top line numbers decent. gotta keep that sweet sweet 40b valuation illusion..,Negative

grab may suck but foodpanda is no saint either. they have notoriously bad customer service (for both customers and delivery crew) and also tries to make you top up into their virtual wallet without you actively agreeing to it.their subscription service is also not transparent and some people reported actually paying more delivery fee with the subscription than without.,Positive

the victim in his car.> advertisement> advertisement> according to the prosecution, tan accepted a booking in the early hours of may 19, 2018, to ferry the victim from wildseed bar at seletar aerospace park to her home.> details of the victim's home were redacted from court documents as she is protected by gag order.> the victim had gone to the bar with her friends the night before and drank about five glasses of beer throughout the evening, said the prosecution.> a friend helped her to book a grab car, and two friends noticed she was tipsy, crying and could not walk straight.> advertisement> advertisement> they helped her to the car, and told tan that the victim was drunk, passing a plastic bag in case she needed to throw up during the journey.> the victim's friend was heard in the in-car camera footage played in court asking the accused to help take her home, thanking him and asking the victim to send a text when she got home.> > the victim lay down in the back seat, crying when tan tried to talk to her, said deputy public prosecutors muhamad imaduddien, chew xin ying and emily koh.> she fell asleep and was woken up by tan when they reached her residence. she alighted but could not access the side gate.> tan led her back to car when she could not enter gate> tan, who is married with three children, saw her looking ""lost and unsteady"", and took her back to his car after she squatted down and began crying.> in statements to the police, tan said that the victim became agitated while in his car and banged her head on the window while crying.> he went to the back seat to console her, and searched her belongings to find out where she lived and took her phone to call someone to get her.> however, instead of helping her home, he began committing sexual offences on her, kissing her before attempting to rape her, alleged the prosecutors.> according to them, tan later drove to a more secluded area and began molesting the victim and sexually assaulting her.> he eventually helped the victim back to her residence and drove off.> for reasons unknown, the victim did not go home and was found by another grab driver at around 4.40am, lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing.> he called the police and waited until an ambulance arrived. the paramedic will testify that the victim was crying and kept struggling when she tried to examine her, said the prosecution. tan's dna was later found in the victim's underwear.> defence likely to argue victim consented> defence lawyers chenthil kumarasingam and adeline goh agree on some facts in the case, including that the victim was crying during the car ride from the bar to her home.> the prosecution will lead evidence from 32 witnesses and tender footage from closed-circuit television cameras and tan's in-car camera.> the footage shows the victim sobbing throughout the car ride, with tan repeatedly asking her what happened and if she had just broken up.> in tan's statements to the police, he admitted that he had not asked the victim for consent, but claimed that she ""participated in some of the sexual acts"".> the prosecutors said tan is likely to argue that he believed in good faith that the victim consented to the sexual acts.> however, they said alarm bells ought to have been raised in tan's mind regarding the victim's behaviour, including her crying, lack of response to his questions, appearing lost and unsteady and that her friend had said she was drunk.> a blood specimen from the victim was later found to contain 26mg per 100ml of blood, with an estimated blood alcohol content at 3am that day in the range of 132.2 to 155.9mg per 100 ml of blood.> the victim's inability to remember events in tan's car may indicate an alcohol blackout, or that she was in deep sleep from alcohol consumption, said the prosecutors.> a consultant from the institute of mental health will testify that the victim was significantly intoxicated and incapable of giving consent to sexual activity, the prosecution added.> when contacted by cna, a grab spokesperson said tan has been banned from grab's platform.> ""our users’ safety is important to us and we have zero tolerance for indecent behaviour, harassment or abuse of any kind. users who have displayed indecent behaviour will be banned from the platform,"" she said.> > the trial continues.

"the difference is that nea shirts are issued free to officers/contractors since they are employees and they are required to return them when they leave the compamy. grab makes the riders pay to buy their kit (not deposit, straight up purchase) and don't accept returns. from the riders' perspective it is something they own since they used their own money to buy it, so why can't they do whatever they want with it. if grab doesn't want people to buy shirts and impersonate delivery riders then they should use the old ""leasing"" system instead",Positive

"hey man, sorry to hear about this. your situation sucks. take it as a lesson when you go out into workforce, that the gig economy is not as beneficial for society as they claimed, and worker class is always marginalized. grab serves as a matchmaking platform between supply and demand. in current situation, current demand simply don’t exist at current supply. and they have no incentive to keep the excess supply, as they know once the time comes around, there will always be people who become grab drivers due to various reasons, and they have many levers to entice people joining. since they are directly dependent on demand to generate bulk of their revenue, during normal times, they need optimize supply to meet the demand in order to maximize revenue. that’s why they always entice drivers to onboard during good times and does the bare minimum to help them during bad times. on the other hand, taxi companies in sg derives revenue from rental, diesel/petrol mark-ups, insurance, etc. they have incentives to make sure supply is always engaged even during bad times. the net cost of parking excess idle taxis and maintenance is higher than if those taxis are rented out at zero rental fees. taxi companies revenue are less dependent on taxi driver’s income, as compared to grab. zero rental from taxi companies while hugely beneficial for taxi drivers, is not an altruistic act. if you want to help out your family situation. at present, borrow a bicycle from your friends, and use it to do grabfood/foodpanda/deliveroo. demand for those will increase with the soft lockdown, as there will be zero dining out and too many young people can’t cook. last mile delivery would also see an increase in demand, so delivery/last mile enabler workers will also be needed. instead of going zero income on tuition entirely, you could offer to be homework checker for your tutee at a smaller fee.wishing you all the best, and hope you will be able to give your parents a better life in future.",Positive

maybe the govt could consider giving all frontline medical/security workers some form of daily transport voucher that allow them to get free rides on taxis1. you somewhat social distance the medical staff from public transport and also free up congestion on trains/buses.2. you help the taxi industry who is currently under utilized.3. a good show of appreciation to the people who are saving lifes daily.,Positive
"use economic incentive to try to divert the huge amount of people going for work. for example, lower the fare for taking mrt before and after the usual peak hour could work. this could try to change people's behaviour using economic incentive and divert as much people away from peak hour as possible.",Positive
"huh you shouldn't be going to work in the first place, as much as possible",Positive
"yeah, the measures need to be consistent across all aspects of life. you can't have one rule at work and in eateries, then ignore it entirely on public transport. we aren't giving the 1m spacing rule a fair assessment because 20% of the time we don't adhere to it.",Positive
"hmmmm. we don't even need vouchers, just pay first and claim if it is just one or two specific gov sector. probably the easiest way to implement for everyone other than finance department at the individual hospital. should allow grab to be used in this way too.",Positive
"a lot of people cannot work from home:medical/hospital staff, police, civil defense, groceries, transport, manufacturing, construction, f+b. we aren't an island of bankers and traders.it would be nice if we could all work from home. but for those of us who can't: we should make it as safe as possible, to get to work, at work and to get home.",Positive
not everybody works in an office setting. most of us work in the service/hospitality and literally the frontliners.,Positive
maybe the solution is your name,Neutral
"this is the wrong way of thinking. you cannot discount the 95% of time adhering to social distancing just because 5% of the time you cant because you're on public transport. you are still lowering transmission in that 95% and that 95% matters alot more than you think.   its not ""all-for-nothing"". its not like you social distance for 23 hours and 1 hour you dont means you die already. that 23 hours matters because you are not spreading the disease in that 23 hours and your chance of contracting is minimised cumulatively.",Positive
"yeah. but not when it's up to 20% of the time for most people spend outside of home. workday is 9 hours including lunch hour, commuting is let's say 1 hour each way. i had work situations where commuting took up 30% of my time outside of home. it's generally way longer than the 30-40minutes you spend eating lunch outside. if we are going to tackle something now, it should be the commute, or the social distancing measures we implement for the relatively shorter lunch times will be lost in the noise.",Positive
"i'm also not discounting the work place measures, these are by far the largest and therefore most important chunk of time we spend outside of home now. unfortunately for the majority of singaporeans, the second largest chunk of time after time at work is time on commute, so we definitely need some measures for this, or it is pointless trying to regulate smaller chunks of time, like lunch hour.",Positive
"just pay the 8 bucks, got money for a dog but not 8 spare bucks? normal drivers are not anticipating dogs.. think of allergies etc",Positive
"muslim drivers don't want dogs in their cars also. suggest you book grab pet, if not later kena complaint.",Negative
don’t be a cheapskate. a pet in any carrier is still a pet. i hope the grab driver cancels you.,Neutral
"if you insists on taking normal justgrab, message the driver ask if he’s okay with the arrangements. if he says he’s not comfortable with it, cancel the ride but let him know beforehand so he don’t waste that extra fuel driving to you. if he didnt reply to the message (maybe due to language barrier), call him and ask politely.",Positive
the grab driver can cancel your booking though,Positive
don't be an ass la. just go with the pet option for grab,Neutral
"honest question, why not comfort? i've never had a problem getting to the vet by taxi, no additional charges either, just let the driver know when booking and keep your pet in its carrier.",Positive
just specify in your comments. tell them not to take job if cannot accept.,Neutral
this.,Neutral
nice way to generalise an entire religion,Positive
thanks. was just asking and get called a cheapskate and all kinds of names. awesome community,Positive
drivers can only read comments after they accept the job,Neutral
is.,Neutral
cheapskate is cheapskate. no need to find excuses. even your post is all about the money.,Neutral
and rejecting will affect their acceptance rate,Neutral
then don't turn on auto accept.,Neutral
yea.,Neutral
"don’t be a clown. i heard from other people experience that they took grab with pet carrier and it was fine. that’s why i’m asking. if your mother sent to hospital and you got choice of private or public hospital, are u the cheapskate for sending her to a public hospital? don’t be stupid la.",Negative
then they will lose even more rides than they already lost due to covid-19.,Positive
they won't. another grab driver will just take the job instead. you can't have everything your way.,Neutral
"grab only protects its own interests.i was going to say ""profits"", but you know..",Positive
"grab express is the delivery service for sending parcels etc  as fair as i can tell, cod is not offered [https://www.grab.com/sg/express/](https://www.grab.com/sg/express/)",Positive
"wait, u wrote an email in the car to grab and expected a response? try calling grab next time, the response is much faster.",Positive
"lol. dude, what do you expect from a grab driver? honest living aside, they are obviously doing this because it’s the best choice for themselves. a number of them have bad attitudes towards their jobs because well; that’s how society treats them too. soooo...you expect a nus scholar to be a grab driver? or a grab driver to go to nus? (no pun intended 😂)",Positive
"no, the email was a day after incident. most of my other drivers are not like this, this one was mentally-ill. (i rarely take grab, but have met at least 4 others who were great)",Positive
there are nus scholars who do grab,Neutral
"exactly. all sorts of people do grab, it's an honest living. i've met a polite well-educated entrepreneur owning his own business and doing grab as a side funsies thing since he likes to drive.thinking that only uneducated, rude rednecks do grab is really short-sighted. (talking about poster above you)",Positive
"phv is not something many people would do, if given a choice. it's an honest living no doubt. side hustle as you said for a few, full time phv is entirely different ball game man.",Positive
"ah yes. full time phv is a different thing. handling customers can get pretty shitty (esp with shitty colleagues and company), and yes i come from full time retail customer service.",Positive
