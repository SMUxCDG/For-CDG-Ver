"hk workshops would love to buy these as parts donor. the crown still runs on the road there. loved the taxis, great legroom, auto closing doors.",Positive
really miss these taxis i rmb the doors would literally swing open with a light pull and boy were they spacious,Positive
u totally missed the chance to call this staxis :d,Neutral
that looks like a random afternoon accident on the cte,Negative
can't they just refurbish it and sell for cheap?,Positive
cars look totally serviceable and new,Positive
the manner in which these crown taxis were stacked one atop another looks oddly satsifying,Neutral

now you know where all the taxis went when you needed one...,Neutral
did they have the doiles on the seats like in japan?,Neutral
still one of the best cars to be taxis.,Positive
crown taxis crowning on top of one another,Positive
lol when it’s midnight on a friday!,Positive
"loved these taxis, were usually driven responsibly, drivers couldn't go too fast unlike the new hybrids and turbo diesels, and yes plenty of space, comfy ride, never in much of a rush, good ole days",Positive
these are built like tanks. and the back seats are very spacious,Neutral
"i remembered how roomy the back seats were, and how powerful the aircon was in some cabs. nothing beats getting in a super chilly cab on a hot ass day. yes i might be the rare ones that loved the smell of pandan leaves.",Positive
"my dad is a cdg taxi driver. the toyota crown was the only 5 seater taxi with the widest leg room ever. you could fit like 6 kids or 2 adults with 3 kids at the back seats with spaces to move about. some of us had to sit on the rubber carpet because we exceeded the number of passengers allowed.the only problem with this taxi is that the leather used for the seat is not that durable, the threading will start to break apart after some time and you can see the sponge under the exposed leather.",Positive
"my dad used to drive em before they got scrapped and he had to change over to the auto transmission hyundai sonata. you can tell when he's in a bad mood. he will over rev the car and the gear change will not be smooth. he also used to tell horror stories of being stuck in traffic jams where u had to work the clutch all the time. now, we just ride the brake when there's a bad jam.rip dad. hope u are enjoying the ride wherever you are.",Negative
seems like a waste to scrap them. can't we give them away to needy families?,Negative
i remember making out with girls while drunk in the back of these taxis. usually after zouk... fond memories indeed.,Negative
this hit me,Neutral

"when did these old boys get phased out? didn't return to sg till a few years back so i've never seen a crown here. but i love the crown taxi in hk, spacious and they're converted to lng to cut carbon footprint.",Positive
can you imagine how long daikin has been with us? geez,Negative
"not gonna lie, this vehicle made me nauseous 🤢😷🤮",Neutral
a part of history... made history :(,Neutral
well this made me nostalgic,Neutral
i miss the times when taxis had this angular shape to them which differentiates them from normal cars. now the taxis are basically like normal cars with the led light on top. edit: i mean back in the early 2000s when cars with streamlined bodies was already becoming a norm. i know that old regular cars also had this angular shape.,Positive
are we allowed to buy one ?,Neutral
"the crown rides like a charm in japan tho, i wonder why it was so bumpy during it's time in service here. can't complain about the excellent legroom in the back tho. man! beats the hyundai konas and toyota priuses we have now on the streets.",Positive
same taxis in hk but red.,Neutral
"the last time i’ve been in singapore was in 2011, but this is still very nostalgic. i’d love to visit singapore again after covid but i heard it’s pretty different now",Positive
these crowns could run forever. why scrap them? i would love to buy one.,Positive
"i miss those cars. the familiar diesel engine sound with its crazy vibrations, the automatic door. what’s not to love?",Negative
"i hated that smell because the only time i would take taxis were when i was sick, and smelling that shit made me wanna puke",Negative
that smell always made me feel like puking for some reason,Neutral
myth buster: dried pandan leaves doesn’t keep cockroaches away.,Neutral
i had the pleasure of riding in one where the driver shifted up and down almost perfectly. this was during the period when automatic taxis were becoming the norm and i praised him when i alighted. could tell it made his day.,Positive
and also if the driver could stop intermittently pressing the accelerator because it “saves fuel”,Neutral
same i would love to drive one,Positive

you can still see them in japan taxis,Neutral
"i am not sure why, but the leg room for backseat passenger seemed extra extra generous. anyone know if the front seat had equally comfortable legroom space?",Negative
always sat in ex-comfort cabs in sabah. driver says they prefer to buy them as they are still in good shape.,Positive
not all of them. but most of our young cars (10yo and below) get sold to many developing countries in the asiapac and africa.,Positive
"they might preserve though, i’m not sure, but it should be feasible since they only need to preserve 1 car of each iconic batch?",Negative
a picture would probably suffice,Neutral
"especially these taxies that were like...the best taxies ever.fuckton of legroom, ample space in the boot for luggage. smooth rides.",Positive
maybe they could have a land transport authority museum showing the evolution of our public transport over the decades.,Neutral
nft,Neutral
wait. i felt singapore has too much museum and nothing much to display. actually why not create movement to supoort your passion/idea. maybe better than the copy cat ice cream museum,Positive
yeah 10 years for well maintained cars are a bit too much honestly. otoh i have seen scrap death traps being driven as public  transport vehicles and  i also hate it.,Negative
planned obsolescence is a bitch,Neutral
trust me cab are anything but perfect condition. they go thru hundreds of thousands of milage a year,Positive
or eng neo avenue exit after an evening shower,Neutral
"we even fit in 3 adults and 3 full sized bikes (dismantled) one time, after the osim 2011 triathlon. cant do that these days.",Positive
they weren't edible,Neutral
it is a waste. i believe exporting these would have been the only option to extend the life span of these long lasting toyotas.,Negative

ya omg same. that smell gives me motion sickness,Neutral
right the old taxis always made me this way,Positive
same here lol,Positive
same!?!? wonder why they kept using them,Neutral
"you have to make sure the pandan is tightly bundled up, then you hit the cockroaches with it, hit them hard, the harder the more effective.",Positive
"can confirm, that time put pandan to deter cockroach they eat it instead :/",Neutral
haha omg so that's where that shit came from. its always the older uncles who drive like this. i hate it so much. then there is the habit of driving like the car has no power steering that they have to keep engaging the wheel left and right. drives me nuts.,Negative
brings back memories of puking,Neutral
holy crap so this was all on purpose? almost puked several times cos of this around early 2010s and still encounter some drivers like this today.,Negative
i think in hk also,Neutral
do they still have the automatic door openers on the japanese crown taxis?,Neutral
"yeah, was in one in kyoto two years ago with the embroidered white seat covers - was taking pictures of the insides with a stupid smile on my face, daughter looked up from ipad  wondering whyone thing i'd noticed about japanese taxis is their door mirrors are not fixed to the door but at the front side panel like how they were fixed in cars a loong time ago here.",Negative
"these older cars are usually roomier because they lack the safety features of newer cars like side impact protection, crumple zones and airbags. front seat space in any car can be adjusted by moving the seats back and forth.",Negative
dont think so. luxury cars usually have big legroom in the back only,Negative
those toyota engines last a long time,Negative
"africa usually love very reliable cars no matter if old or new, so i wonder why these got scrapped.",Positive
just one wont be so hard,Negative
and also great tin cans to make yourself a sardine in the event a crash happens. even today’s taxis have the bare minimum in safety standards. automotive safety regulation in singapore is still stuck in the past - no mandatory requirement for minimum side impact protection ratings or mandatory side airbags. and the g’s favorite word “cost” isn’t even a major factor here (at least not the cost price to the car manufacturers). some deaths in singapore taxis could have been prevented (or at least injuries that eventually proved fatal reduced) otherwise.,Positive
"the [sg mobility gallery](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_organisation/sg_mobility_gallery.html) would be what you're looking for. thought i can't remember if there is showcasing of actual vehicles and whatnot, considering it's been some time and they have updated it in 2018.",Neutral
"in a couple of years even some of the mercedes-benz buses will be sent to the yard....perfectly good condition, no one would even think of them as ""old"", but somehow they can't be on the roads anymorei understand wanting to constantly push for better emissions or even move to electric, but creation of vehicles and consumption of buying more also has emissions. it's reduce, reuse, recycle....in that order.",Positive
"this isn't planned obsolescence, it's public policy",Neutral
"omg i'm not the only one who suffers from this?? i'm prone to motion sickness and the moment i enter such taxis with ""that smell"", it triggers my motion sickness 100% of the time...but no one in my family seem to pick up or mind that smell, so i always thought i'm the odd one...",Negative
motion sickness. the combination of pandan and the on-off-on-off-on-off of the accelerator… who taught these guys how to drive.,Neutral
"apparently cockroaches hate the smell pandan leaves, thus you'll find these in many cabs. i, on the other hand, loves the smell of pandan leaves. beats the smell of stale ciggies",Negative
engaging then wheel sideways is also on purpose? what is the rationale behind doing so?,Negative
fax 😭,Neutral
dude totally,Neutral
yes they do!,Neutral
yes!,Neutral
its a very japanese thing. u can see on older cars and supposedly makes it less distracting than beside the door,Negative
"that's absolutely right, but the other problem is also the fact that phvs are almost all compact or subcompact cars, which are not optimised for back seat passenger comfort.it's not that the cars are badly designed by the car companies per se; it's just that small cars were simply not designed with chauffeured services in mind. they're made to be good city runabouts for small families and such. drive to and from work, toss the kids in the back on the weekends, type of cars.the smallest cars i would consider ""good as a taxi"" would be altis, mazda 6, octavia etc. but you see grab drivers using honda fit everywhere lol.",Positive
"quite sure there were all 2l diesel, quite an insane engine for a taxi",Negative
"japanese petrol passenger cars are more popular in west africa.yeah mostly toyotas.also toyota crowns are the top luxury model for toyota, but the taxi model is the super old gen with diesel engine. the point is crowns do not share much parts with most toyota generic parts i think, i have yet to see this taxi model of crown in africa before.few months in ghana/cameroon. my experience in the continent is limited, there are over 50 countries in it.",Positive
there was one displayed at alexandra hospital carpark few years ago. dont know where tf it went and dont see the reason why they couldnt keep it,Negative
do we really have that many fatal taxi accidents here? honest question.,Positive
"amen. i have a feeling one of the main reasons for this the car sales industry. limited car ownership means limited revenue if extended ownership/drivability is allowed. i agree with you on the total environmental impact is the same if not greater, scrapping/shipping these off.",Negative
"currently, sbs transit has begun scrapping [this generation](https://landtransportguru.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7462-sbst.jpg) of buses early, the[ first wheelchair accessible buses in sg.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/sbs7314a_021_27062006_dsc1007_s.jpg) they initially had two more years of lifespan left, due to be deregistered in 2023.[next after, would be the scania k230ub](https://landtransportguru.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/8049_99.jpg), which is due to be deregistered in 2024.",Positive
people learn a buzzword and then use it everywhere they go lmaoo,Neutral
well it's essentially planned obsolescence being applied as part of a policy no? the two are not mutually exclusive terms...,Neutral
"oh ordinarily i love the smell of pandan leaves. the mix with diesel, rubber, jerky driving, and yes, stale ciggies (still discernible at times) immediately triggers nausea @_@ some of the new sickly sweet air fresheners are no different unforch. i know it can’t quite be helped by cabbies that are just trying to make their cabs a clean and decent smelling environment.",Positive
oh fuk im a cockroach,Neutral
"older or ill maintained vehicles have a gap in steering usually somewhere in the middle. to turn it you need to ""feel"" the steering wheel engage and that is only when the the vehicles wheel will start turning. so drivers have a habit of moving their arms left and right to have a feeling of security and control. you can imagine in an older vehicle the gap doesn't swerve the vehicle at all and the arms instinctively stop and turn to the other side once it hits the engaged angle, much like a driving dance move 😂. if this has been so engrained in your body going to a modern car would make the car go swerve  left and right as it follows the arms more sensitivelysource: started learning driving from my old uncle jeepney/truck driver. then rode with him on a modern vehicle and it clicked.",Positive
"yeap, larger saloons seems to be disappearing from taxi use as well. once those hyundai i40s, renault latitudes and kia optimas get scrapped there will mostly only be compact cars left in taxi fleets.",Positive
not even close dude. planned obsolescence specifically refers to designing a product to fail at a set time in the future.,Negative
"hnmm, i don't recall smelling rubber, definitely remembered the jerky rides. maybe my ongoing sinus issues prevented the smell of those cheap air fresheners from affecting me. but man, those extra spacious roomy backseats sure beats some of the grab cars nowadays.",Positive
have had several vezel drivers do this! amazing to understand why now.,Positive
"seems like i've been misunderstanding the meaning of the phrase as something broader than what it really covers, thanks for correcting me without being a dick about it 🙏",Positive
"you know they'll have a blissful marriage, none of them really care about ""face"" or what others really think. this is a sign of a couple that knows that marital bliss doesn't come from comparing with other people.",Positive
"if the day ever comes for me, i would absolutely love this. quite aside from the fact that i for some weird reason love the ioniq taxis, the fact that someone thought of me so much would be touching.",Positive
kind of adventurous. also got some local \*flair to it,Positive
i love this so much! and bless this wonderful uncle who not only offered the cab but also paid and decorated it. sincerity is priceless ✨edit: the bride’s dress is gorgeous,Positive
"never understood why we(chinese) like to spend so much just to flex to our family members for one day 🤦‍♂️ really appreciate posts like these, as long as the love is there, that’s most important and the plus side is if you save this much on transport, you can save more for honeymoon(not talking about covid situation but in general)",Positive
that's the wholesome i need for the day,Neutral
"i am embarrassed, not for them but for me, before i even read the explanation i was judgemental, but after reading i am embarrassed that i have such a high material love and i need to change. thanks to this couple i now understand that love is more than and not what other people think.",Positive

"that’s very special, now i want a london cab so i can wear my top hat for my wedding!",Positive
"i think the fact that they wore blue-ish *helped*. i think it’s cute and memorable.honestly, most couples save money by borrowing cars from their friends and family. the flowers is actually a big chunk of that cost.",Positive
never thought i'd see my cousin on reddit lol,Positive
very good. save the money for something more important,Positive
"they happy, who cares what other thinks?",Positive
nothing wrong with that. it's just a vehicle from point a to b. what more there's a link in it being a family member's office.my parents as well used a taxi as a wedding car when they got married; though this was back in the 70s/80s (can't remember the exact year rn) and it was a black cab. (can't remember the exact sorry but i think they borrowed it from a friend?),Negative
that's so wholesome,Neutral
"honestly very few guests will see the wedding car anyway, so this it's a good way to save for the rest of the wedding",Positive
these are smart people.,Positive
can the text on the taxi be customised? i can see it being pretty cool to have a scrolling ‘just married’ run across the roof of the car.,Positive
"aw, that's cute. i love that their wedding clothes match the taxi.",Positive

"it's one thing to splurge, it's another thing to tell yourself that you can recover the cost from ang bao.",Neutral
>sure why notno issues there. but the effort for comfortdelgro to go ask lta is commendable. they could just say no,Positive
"not really that weird to ask lta tbh. using a car for commercial reasons is different from using it for personal purposes, comes with an extra layer of rules. besides the taxi is not owned by the guy but by comfortdelgro, he’d have to ask them if he can use it for this instead of using the car to earn $$. he just has dibs on renting that particular car, he can’t just go off using company equipment for personal reasons without first alerting his boss who has to ask his boss, and it probably escalated to lta that way. mostly speculation on my part though from a brief understanding of taxis here.",Positive

"last taken in 2014 for me - i remembered the ride so clearly because it was my first year in poly and i was running pretty late, but no cabs wanted to stop for me. the uncle of the crown taxi that eventually pulled over was super happy that i even tried flagging him because he said nobody likes old taxis anymore. i told him a taxi is still a taxi, especially when you are running late, but also mentioned i didn't expect to be seeing ""this kind of taxis on the street anymore"". he mentioned how it was the last few months with his taxi and he will have to change over to the hyundais very soon. was being nostalgic and all and it made me relish that ride a lot more - also turns out to be my last ride in a crown.",Positive

"i was once told by a mechanic at cdg that the model we got was cobbled together primarily for the singapore market with little regard for emissions or comfort. (hong kong banned diesel taxis early in the game.) they fitted it with the same diesel engine as the hiace van and dyna lorries. unrefined and relatively weak, yes, but abuse-resistant and easy to repair. the sonata that followed was a quantum leap ahead in refinement (due to commonrail fuel injection), but nowhere near as reliable, partly because drivers tended to idle it for long periods the same way they did the crown, which was really bad for the newer injection and diesel emissions systems.",Negative

i can't put my finger on what that smell was but it sure is nauseating. also the fact that most kids are not big enough to be able to look out the windows from the deep plushy seats which makes motion sickness worse.,Positive
i remember one ride quite vividly. as the taxi driver drove me to the back house. i realized it was the entrance to the servant quarters instead of the main house. was pissed as a graduate and from then on i swore my revenge.,Positive
"they say the hotter the engine gets, the smoother it runs. i've seen instances where the car was not even switch off during handovers. the person taking over just pats the beads on the seats and off they go liao.",Neutral
there's a reason why cities in japan still have tonnes of them even though [its replacement came out in 2017](https://www.torque.com.sg/features/toyotas-new-generation-taxi-is-far-more-comfortable-than-old-crown-comfort/),Positive
they saw when 9 became 5,Neutral
i miss them. that speed warning ting ting was so soothing.,Neutral
cedric not as spacious,Neutral
don’t worry i have some other taxi models coming up you guys never even knew existed,Negative
very small. looks big nia.,Negative
still are. when i was there last year seem to be still 70% plus. they were manufactured all the way up until 2017.,Neutral
vinyl upholstery and tropical heat. very potent combination.,Positive
"the old taxis were more of workhorses than the modern standards,the old one really showed a side of singapore not many knew existed which was the “tough and undefeated” side of singapore,this taxis traversed singapore roads for as long as public transportation was a priority and it has always remains a part of any singaporean’s childhood even the older ones",Positive
we are the same person lol,Positive
don't think so. i don't think the models in hk had those either-- just the ones in japan.,Neutral
"some of the later darker blue comfort ones had them, but they were seldom used. a driver only used it once when i was struggling with carrying a lot of stuff and had trouble closing the door.",Negative
"iirc was a retrofit option not done to all cars. the drivers hated them. the stupid lever is mechnically linked to the door, somehow. so when the door opens, the bloody lever goes up.",Negative
"a lot of the early ones have been scrapped. in fact, if i'm not wrong, all the pre-facelift models are already gone and the remaining ones on the road are the facelift models. they have a slightly different grill design.",Negative
bouncy. i personally remembered the experience as a flying tin can.,Neutral
"no last retired in 2014,however 2 models have been preserved around singapore.this vehicle were scrapped because it did not meet singapore’s emission standards",Neutral

also room for kid me to throw up from the smell of the interior.,Neutral
"morbid to know when i was younger i was happily riding in a death machine without even wearing a seatbelt (there was little enforcement on wearing seatbelts then so i often forgot). ignorance is bliss lol, a single emergency brake may have killed me. also happy cake day dude.",Positive
"don't the japanese taxis also use crowns? they're also really spacious, though, and i assume their airbags are working and present.",Positive
either they drive so slow that it’s too slow or you sit in the front,Negative
"wtf, you on the wrong platform and thread m8?",Negative
🤤those taxi beads,Neutral
so cute. looks damn comfortable too,Neutral
hahahahaha looks like a faketaxi 😐,Neutral
"the suspension was definitely stiffer, and the engine was torque-ier. made for better ride quality, imo. i felt more comfortable on the cedric than i was on the crown. also maybe slight bias cuz my dad used to drive the cedric before it got replaced with the sonata.",Positive
london cabs anyone?,Neutral
you sure? i was under the impression all had them just seldom used. the crown comfort was specifically designed for taxiuse so seem strange some had it some not. extra option perhaps.not trying to discredit you just genuinely curious? cant find much info on this online.i had drivers used the autodoors on occasion(but rarely) for a span at least 10yrs when i took cab regularly. like once or twice a year.drivers would especially use it if you had a lot of stuff with you and got out of the car.,Negative
"the lever definitely got in the way when drivers had to get out and help passengers with luggage, since it'll be sticking up with the passenger side door open. some nissan cedrics were also retrofitted with the auto-door mechanism towards the tail end of the cedric era (some time around '04, iirc).",Neutral
anything is possible if u try hard enough,Negative
so you were the taxi uncle nightmare?,Neutral
"wa high five. i had the same problem when i was younger (up till i was 13?) riding in taxis, especially in the crowns. not helping was that i had motion sickness and not being able to look out of the windows and see movement really messed me up real bad. and worst was when they had those terrible ""air fresheners"" onboard.",Negative
young'nt,Neutral
"lol what is seatbelt? it's only in recent years that i've started wearing seatbelt while seated at the back, and mostly to not give the driver any trouble with the tp if caught because they (driver) don't enforce it either.",Positive
"japanese models are current, mostly from 2015 to 2017. theirs and the hk versions come with driver controlled doors, airbags etc. always great to sit in one when i’m in tokyo or hk, feels nostalgic.",Positive
he used to drive lorry and van before that but i can take it. it could be the smell like you mention.,Neutral
"he's joking about the mahathir incident hahaha*during a meeting with lee kuan yew in 1978, mahathir had recounted how, he had “directed a taxi driver to the home of a lady friend, but had been brought to the servants’ quarter of this house. he never forgot this insult”.*",Positive
since we're both using anecdotal evidence i don't see how i would be less sure about my anecdote than you are about yours.,Positive
i seen pics of the crown comfort having the tesla model x’s door fitted instead,Neutral
that's actually pretty cool. didn't know that hong kong also has the auto doors as well. wish singapore also went with that model with the auto-opening doors and stuff.,Positive
i will take a bet that it is better in a lorry/van because of the ground clearance! the higher ground clearance makes it better for me,Positive
the crown taxi..... i miss it.,Neutral
maybe with digital marketing is better?,Positive
nearly about to install adblocker on my spectacles.,Positive
"- less taxis on the road- taxi billboard doesn’t allow clear roi since it is more of a “one-way” advertising. firms need to know whether their advertising works or not.- digital marketing allows firms to collect huge variety of data such as how long you stare, what demographic are you, whether do you make a purchase/decision after watching the ad.",Positive
funny you mention this because i just saw one earlier today,Positive
"i just saw one taxi advertising moove media, with horns. rlly throwback sia i didn’t even realise the advertising was almost gone.",Neutral
still have,Neutral
"i recall the taxi drivers do not like those bill boards on their vehicles too. adds weight, reduced fuel efficiency, driving affected by lateral wind and limits the places they can drive into like multi storey carparks etc.",Neutral
i wonder how much that and the taxi sign affects fuel efficiency. with how optimized modern cars are i wouldn't be surprised if the answer is significant. so competition with grab means they have to actually take into account what drivers want instead of just getting free money on top of rental.,Positive
nostalgia man the pic,Neutral
they're still around on some cabs. i just took one on friday with a billboard attached. a comfort hyundai i40 to be precise.,Neutral
"nah, its much more effective to have targeted ad campaigns rather then just a poster or a billboard. thats why selling data is so lucrative its so much easier and cheaper to sell a shoe to someone who is actively looking for a shoe.",Positive
"[""this is just weight reduction, weight reduction so we go faster""](https://youtu.be/pcgdfpaweb0?t=467)",Neutral
anyone remember bus with tv at the exit door?,Neutral
still looks way better than the absolutely pointless clips on replay in the mrts.,Positive
there used to have advertisements on the bus too. i think all gone is because they cause distraction. drivers on the road should focus to driving.,Neutral
i guess socmed ads are more effective.,Positive
"why? nobody looks up, or looks out windows anymore.",Neutral
i saw one today. it cannot be missed with the horns on its roof.,Neutral
"it's probably because everyone is on their phone. back in the day, most people would observe their surroundings, with perhaps a small percentage that would be reading the papers or a book. however, now 90% of the people are on their phones, meaning that the number of people that would see the ad would likely be much lower.",Positive
$2.40,Neutral
and the smell of pandan leaves,Neutral
probably someone complained about it setting off an epileptic seizure. i remember there used to be one on the journey between orchard and newton but i only ever saw it like twice and that was in the early 2000s,Negative
also advertising on tunnel walls at station platforms,Neutral
"i even remember the version that was ""animated"" when the train passes by.what i miss is having the station names displayed on the tunnel walls so that it's easier to spot your station when you're approaching, no idea why they removed those.",Neutral
i’ve seen some still on the north east line still!,Neutral
"yeah i work in the industey, physical media is so fucking expensive (you can find the rate cards online), it's not worth it.you can reach more people with targeted digital advertising, which are also much more actionable and trackable.",Positive
that company is a subsidiary of comfortdelgro 🤯,Neutral
moove cash cow! no idea what they're trying to do other than their cow mascot celebrating lunar new year of the ox.,Negative
"got so serious anot, with the billboard they aren’t higher than a mini van, like the nv200, which can enter most if not all carparks which are typically 2.0-2.1m height",Positive
yup and the frequent glitches lol,Positive
ample leg room,Neutral
"used to remember on the east west line between raffles place and tanjong pagar too. if i wasn't wrong there also used to be one between braddell and toa payoh on the north south line too, but have been updated to be long taken down now.",Negative
all hail adblock. your methods don't work with me,Neutral
hot take: i think physical media decorating the oublic is still preferable than digital continuously fucking up your online experience.,Negative
not sure about others but the mscp downstairs has a 1.8m limit. i actually have to duck to avoid hitting my head on the swinging pole before the gantry.,Negative
ikr.,Neutral
every 400m was $0.10,Neutral
i definitely saw it on the north south line maybe 10 years back (ish) at orchard (or somerset) stations!,Neutral
"they work for larger marketing campaigns, when you have a huge budget to blow, and when you want to constantly remind people of something. i think you're thinking about genshin? they had a very aggressive campaign and they can certainly afford it considering their explosion in userbase.",Positive
"sticking printed vinyl on a vehicle is cheaper and simpler than having an actual billboard on top of the car. as well as being a lot larger. and it is more effective when the product is something nearly untargetable, like a new soft drink flavor (not saying it can't be targeted, just that nearly everyone is a potential consumer).",Positive
"you'd be surprised how many people don't use adblock/enable privacy options.plus, a lot of marketing is integrated, meaning they don't appear as hard selling ads but are part of a larger campaign, like events and celebrity endorsements. we'll get to you, don't worry.",Positive
adblock only covers a really miniscule percentage of online ads.,Positive
"i think so too, physical when done well can be really cool, but we have to follow the statistics and calculators",Positive
there is a car park in pasir ris with a 1.68m clearance. 2m plus is super tall.,Positive
count 8 lampposts per 10 cents to make sure the meter is properly calibrated.,Positive
"ikr! holy shit, does time fly so fast!",Positive

"so did honkai impact, i believe.",Neutral
"seriously, just look at the many posts here complaining about youtube ads. i never even knew about them until i saw the posts here lmao.",Positive
"what's a celebrity? lol.unless you are using famous athletes, you ain't getting here",Positive
"yea ads are everywhere.was considering buying a surface laptop but decided not to. went to watch falcon and winter soldier and guess what, the laptop is in the damn show",Neutral
playing with the window crank,Neutral
no adblock for iphones though,Neutral
lmao athletes are old news nowit's all about social media influenzas nowadays... anyone with a decent sized following will be enlisted and trust me the results will surprise you.,Positive
"yeah, famous athletes endorsing products are also pretty common so you probably will see an ad or two eventually.the way online marketing works is really scary sometimes when i think abt it. just talking on your phone about a subject like pizza is gonna trigger a whole wave of ads about pizzas.unless you are still using some old school phone like a nokia 3310, dont use a pc and don't browse the internet. the ads will appear eventually.",Positive

i skip over the ad segments and use adblocks. what now?,Neutral
adblock works very well on youtube. didn't even know youtube is so annoying now until i saw my girlfriend watching videos on her phone.,Positive
what kind of youtubers are u watching lol?,Positive
"nope. don't watch lame youtubers.besides, i'll teach you a good tip. if you feel an ad is coming up, press the right arrow on the keyboard a few times and it will go away. also, i don't watch ads so i feel no desire to online shop.",Positive

i did some stupid stuff when i was 15 but this is just next level,Negative

would be interesting if “he reported to have a license” at that age.,Positive
"> what was not known at that time was that the incident was the result of a teenager crashing the vehicle because he did not have a license. this is even better. i mean, it's possible the 15 yo knew how to drive from driving go-karts, or secretly taking lessons, or taking lessons overseas (learner's permit can be obtained at 14 in some parts of us). but how the heck was it ""not known at that time"" that a 15 yo did not have a license?!",Positive

unless the father reports that the taxi was stolen (which one can argue is not inaccurate). dunno whether that’ll work in singapore but in other countries you can do that (although imo it’s a very inefficient way to deal with this) and the son will be in bigger trouble.,Negative
wah how you park sia,Neutral
"i had a friend who did the same because he wanted to show off to us, and he almost crashed into a taxi (the taxi was in our left blindspot and my friend wanted to change lane). that could've been jail and driving ban for him. then again, i was a bad friend for not talking him out of it.",Negative

(at 12, my mom paid me to type invoices for her in her office during my school holidays)so i had savings. but yea, as a teenager, you really don't think alot of things through.also lots of reckless adventures in australia lol. alot of things were sheer luck, nothing serious really happened.",Positive

been almost 8 years since i last got a taxi there!!,Neutral
"signboard says $12 per head. takes 4 passengers to go. the one in the center backseat the most uncomfortable la.... imagine sharing with strangers. but usually is with people you know la.i took it once back when it was $10 per head. shared with a partner, we “bao-ed” the taxi for 4x $10 ($12 nowadays per signboard)i think i took the my teksi (there are also some singapore comfort cab but they need to apply some special license/tag to ferry passengers across the causeway and strictly that fixed route only.) same thing, past customs as any private vehicle and drop you off. i can’t remember which terminal it stopped. i guess the my teksi more hiong, dare to stop anywhere la.iirc, once past 7pm, very few service cabs at the terminal already. i don’t think the my cabbies want to stay in sg also. most will be queuing for the bus services since the frequency is faster. don’t know about customs clearance though. haha.the my cabbies all got wear uniform one. white top shirt. i remember seeing one vintage merc (one of a kind in the cp) they also like to lepak around waiting for passengers back then.",Positive

time to create a half blood taxileft side sg right side mythen can park anywhere liao,Positive
should be the same and factored in already. that’s probably why they (my teksis) don’t take the peak hour routes (knock off timings unless they too are going back). i’m pretty sure their counterparts at the jb terminal station will feedback on traffic.the buses already cater to the migrant workers who transit daily and maximise their earnings. the cabs are more for privacy and comfort. $3.30 (bus) vs $12 taxi is almost 4x. definitely not for the everyday migrant worker. just like an entry level admin taking grab to work everyday. hahaha.,Positive
"well the structure has been like that for donkey years. just one shelter and an altar behind. the cabbies lepak below some trees/bushes just along the fence beside which separates the parking bay from a church. there is a primary school just across which is soon giving way since it it merging and shifting to another premise in 2023.the once colourful rochor center hdb flats was also just opposite, been demolished since 2018.there is also an old skool cobbler just at the corner of the bus queue. further down was where the sungei road thieves market was. closed since 2017.",Positive

you know grab screwed up when taxi fares are lower than fares on grab,Neutral
"love it. more competition is sorely needed in the transportation sector, and grab should’ve never been allowed to buy uber sg in the first place.",Positive
honestly sometimes comfort is cheaper than other taxi services. and they would pick me up/drop me off at far flung places,Positive
"i'm no fan of grab at all. but i remember before uber and grab came along, cdg was the og monopolistic bully in the market. they'd raise taxi rental on drivers and increase fare at will. it was also super hard to get taxis. if i needed a taxi on weekends or weekday peak hours, i could wait up to 1 hour by the road cos sengkang was supposedly very far. most of us have forgotten the experience of standing by the road waving at taxis and them not stopping, and later when we finally caved in and call, we see the same taxis coming to pick us up. taxis used to be such luxury and would easily cost double or more the fares today. i  only had budget for 2 taxi rides a month as a young adultuber (not grab) changed everything!",Positive
"i actually very much want to use comfort over grab. however for me somehow when comparing prices between comfort and grab (from central to the north), it’s usually the same price (which i’ll book comfort) or grab is slightly cheaper (though now with the extra 1 dollar comfort may edge slightly ahead) -  not sure if this is unique to long d trips?",Positive
good. more competition always benefit consumers,Positive
"ah the weekly grab circlejerk. people still forget that grab tends to be cheaper during peak hours and is more consistent.i use all taxi brands and whichever is the cheapest, i go for it. definitely am liking this move from cdg.",Positive
comfort is mostly cheaper these days and the fact that their drivers are laojiao taxi drivers with no need for gps (which can be wrong at times).,Negative
they should fix their app first. the discount code always has glitches. even though the discount has been applied somehow you end up paying the full fare.,Positive
always used comfort after uber left.,Neutral
finally. for years cdg has been growing fat and slow from its near monopoly in taxi booking. only until uber and grab started with their vastly superior apps that they start to wake up the idea and start investing in developing their platform.,Negative
"didnt they just launch zig with a lot of advertisment and promos, why would they get ready to launch another mega app with the same services?!",Positive
"great, competition at work!",Positive
"fuck grab, that is all",Negative
this is my experience. grab drivers need gps and cannot go off map as they don't care to know the shortcut. cdg drivers thru zip don't use gps. they tell me the shortcuts they will take.the metered fares should be phased out as they encourage tricks of the trade. zip and low fares is the way to claw back business. maybe grab will be aggressive with their promotions after p2ha!,Neutral
uber came and grab conquered.gojek came and grab still survived.now fight comfort.,Neutral
plot twist: grab buys over comfortdelgro,Neutral
"big big hooray from me! stop grab's money grabbing! support companies with diversified shareholding and stop padding the pockets of anthony tan! so many unethical practices and always go back on their promises (still angry they cancelled my delivery pass just when covid struck). rather tip the delivery guy more and pay grab less, that's the true meaning of support local, not support one man's pocket.",Positive
as someone who visits singapore frequently for work i was actually surprised how much cheaper (not affordable but cheaper) a conventional cab was vs grab...,Positive
"great to see cdg add services and improve.without competition, maybe they won't even have a mobile app.",Positive
they need to improve their app. it has a horrible user interface now. drivers and cars good though.,Positive
"i deliberately use comfort or gojek even if grab is cheaper. every single time i dealt with that company either as a consumer or an employee, they stank of  corporate greed of the worst kind.",Negative
during late night grab is usually cheaper.,Negative
nothing to love imo. they already had an app. now they are adding unrelated services into it like car rental which is irrelevant to 99 percent of current app users.,Positive
you are so right! i've been a loyal cdg user rhese days but i did forget of the monopoly days where we were at the mercy of cabbies.getting a cab after a night out was a nightmare on certain time of the day. i lived in the city. all the cabs wanted to go to bedok and wouldnt pick me up. i walked home on some days.,Positive
"i hated that constant increase of fare, and stupid reasons of we haven't increased fares in so and so years. then when they introduce a new taxi model bam! higher fares.but the absolute worst thing is the confusing as fuck surcharges, and area surcharges and surcharge for pickup at airport and rws/mbs.and if that's not all.....cdg owns sbs transit, who fucks you by constantly increasing bus fares year on year.so when people see cdg as some sort of 'saviour' from the likes of grab, all i see is a giant knocked of it's perch and now playing the victim.fyi: grab actually started of as grabtaxi which actually tried to solve the issue of an app for taxi booking.",Negative
"honestly there are some factors determining the price, such as distance, traffic and demand, to name but a few. ultimately if they are around the same price, i'd rather flag down a taxi for a cheaper price (no booking fee) and just go by the meter, especially when i know that there is little to no traffic. just curious if you book comfort, do you use flat rate or go by meter?",Negative
flat rate as shown on the app which is the one that is similar to grab. meter price always seems higher on the app (!!),Positive
"i've heard that grab is able to peek at the other apps running in your phone, and can detect when you're price shopping and adjust their offered price so that they don't lose out. whereas if you're not actively comparing, they know it's safe to gouge you.",Positive
"this is an important point, my personal experience is comfortdelgro cabbies have generally higher and more consistent professional quality - know the places, know the ways, smooth driving. some part-time grab drivers can really drive you crazy. one time the gps was not accurate in showing the entrance of the complex, and my dear driver religiously followed the gps and took me around the block two rounds....",Positive
if at first you don’t succeed…,Positive
"pretty sure grab's only enemy is itself, it dominate the market as long as it doesn't self destruct. comfort ,like all giant glc in sg , is unlikely to change or innovate fast enough and will die a slow death..",Positive
s'poreans to cdg :  you have become the very thing that you swore to destroy !,Negative
u mean ‘grab’ your money ?,Negative
>straitstimes.com/singap...makes me wonder where all the grab investor money went.,Neutral
how?,Neutral
"they are in completely different businesses though. grab is going into finance, emerging markets, marketplace and so on, whereas comfort deals in the more established existing transport system. looking at grabs upcoming ipo, the additional funds injected + investor pressure will make it interesting to see if they will turn profitable within 2 years. if they do, i believe their future prospect would be better than that of comfort.entering new markets (be it geographical or product wise) is always difficult, you need to pump money in it.",Positive
taxi rental is expensive as fk.,Negative
marketing? they did a pretty good job at it.,Positive
maybe anthony has a holiday home at hokkaido too lol,Positive
"finance is not just payments but, yes i do think your points are valid from that perspective. shrugs who knows what will happen, i just know the anti grab circlejerk is strong in this sub.",Positive

"i'm 16 and i still have memories riding around in these taxicabs (including the nissan cedrics)  i was never born during when the sbs taxi existed but i can recall just how easy it was to get in and our of those taxis since they were quite spacious. although my brothers had to sit on the laps of my mother and our nanny (we had them because both my parents were at work and i and my siblings were very young at that time... (the late 2000s to early 2010s))  additionally, i actually preferred the nissan cedric over the toyota crown since the crown was very popular (and for good reason) so the cedric just felt rare to me at the time. i think we can all appreciate how these taxi models just made taxis very popular back then but now not so much anymore since the likes of grab and uber exist.",Positive
oh man...the legroom...heavenly!,Neutral

i saw a whole line of taxis at a neighborhood mall last night after midnight and it breaks my heart... especially when the uncle looked at me as i walked past... sorry lah uncle i really don't need a taxi to go ntuc.,Negative

those driving night shift really having a hard time now.,Negative
imagine when people and firms get used to wfh and have much less need to go to the office.this could be a permanent mindset change.the taxi services need to re-engineer their processes and allow their drivers to work food or goods delivery in the future.,Positive
"poor them. i hope they are actively approached for re-employment. sometimes, when someone is in a decent job like computer science or accounting, agencies actively approach the professionals if they are interested for a switch. we need exactly the same thing here. there are other transport jobs going up in demand like food delivery, groceries, cargo delivery and even transport for vip etc. taxi uncles don't have time to seek such jobs because they can't afford to stop their vehicles and multitask.  they should be actively approached by the agencies.",Positive
gov should just waiver the minimum travel distance for now,Neutral
tried to take a cab the other day. the uncle turned me down because it was too far (even though the indicator didn’t say that he was changing shifts). worst part was that he refused to move so i couldn’t even take the cabs behind him. had to walk to another taxi stand.,Negative

1 passenger in 4 hours? that won't pay for the petrol. he should just return the taxi and take the free 9k (is it 1k per month?). then find some other part time job as grab delivery or something. he can always take the taxi job again when demand is back.,Positive

he don't want that as well. i believe it has something due to his age. he used to be working at marine industry with high pay for almost 30 years until his age starting to appear. he quit and become taxi driver since then. even his wife or my step mom try to convience work elsewhere but he refuse.,Positive

"itt (and everywhere, tbh): an obsession with who is right, rather than a focus on risk reduction. right or not, you can reduce the risk in this situation. possible risk reduction strategies:* taxi driver could take longer to ensure road is clear, thinking about bikes and not just larger vehicles.* rider could have positioned themselves more centrally in the lane as they approached, making themselves more visible earlier* road design could be re-thought to improve visibility, or additional markings to enhance a ""think bike"" attitude amongst drivers* rider could have better anticipated the taxi pulling out and slowed, just in case.these are not about assigning blame, but about reducing risk. risk doesn't care who is to blame, only what could have stopped it. there's usually several opportunities for a risk to be mitigated, and when we obsess with who is right, we forget about that.as others have pointed out, it doesn't matter if you are right, if you are also dead.hopefully those involved, as well as those who have seen the vid/gif, can learn something from it, and improve their driving/cycling as a result.",Negative

i would call the driver a dumb fuck for not braking when they say the taxi was already past the line. you got right of way doesn't mean you should not do anything to prevent a collision.,Negative
yes i saw the video and you were right!,Positive
"i think the problem is the concept of “blame”. it’s an accident. people make mistakes. the problem is with insurance and that ultimately somebody is *more* at fault, therefore ends up taking 100% of the blame. i do think the taxi was more at fault, but i don’t believe the driver deserves mud thrown at them when it’s very clearly an accident. shit happens. the rider was going too fast, but it’s also not their fault. ultimately, you’re responsible for your own safety and if you watch the video it’s pretty clear he was not riding safely. the accident is not their fault, but their unsafe riding absolutely is.",Positive
maybe he went to park his car out of the way? we won't know. cos if there are no fatalities... vehicles should be moved out if tye way and not obstruct traffic.maybe he did try to run.. we don't know the other side of the story.,Negative
don't think a bicycle lane would have helped the cyclist in the same situation. it was carelessness on the driver and lack of defensive riding from cyclist.,Neutral

i'll be honest there's no point in having a bicycle lane..try driving along those ecp with bike lanes..majority of cyclist doesn't utilise it but instead still cycle on the road.,Positive

"not sure if you’ve seen the video of the group of cyclists riding on the main road even though there was a clear cycling lane on the side. two guys wiped out on the road. say what you want about infrastructure but assholes gonna asshole. so very many cyclists are assholes. go to ecp. perfectly good cycling paths along the sea, yet they have to cycle on the single lane service roads. so don’t blame infrastructure when cyclists don’t even use those that exist.",Positive
"while he may have been wrong, but based on the video i can't say that he is 'definitely' wrong in that he might have done all the necessary checks before the cyclist came along cos that area looks like quite a blind spot for cyclists cos bicycles are smaller in profile.",Negative
"you can see in the video that the taxi driver is slowing down before accelerating onto the road. i assume the cyclist was expecting that the taxi was coming to a full stop and give priority (as he should), that is what it looked like until the moment he accelerated again. at that point in time there were less than 2 seconds left until the collision.",Positive
they have the same as cars.. you don't know the rules? i hope you don't drive a car.,Neutral
"what? are you suggesting that the taxi driver moved off because he knew he could 'out-langgah' a bicycle?i agree that if it's an 8 wheeler truck the taxi wouldn't have proceeded, but it's because he would've been able to see the oncoming truck. seems to me that the taxi stopped, checked abit but by the time the cyclist came into view the cabbie probably already turned his head back already.i don't think he meant to block the cyclist on purpose lol. yes in this case it's the taxi drivers fault, but probably an accident.",Positive
"eh, no no. in this case the cabbie definitely has a case for not being able to see the cyclist because there was a blindside hedge combine that with the cyclist riding on the left side of the lane it made it more difficult for the cabby to see the cyclist. the cyclist is not at fault.the cabbie maybe should have checked better but this is not as clear cut as you are making out to be. the road design definitely has some issues. plus if it is a 8 wheller, the cabbie could definitely have seen it.",Positive
"there is a reason traffic laws are as such (side road giving way to main road), and people should 'exercise their entitlement' so that the roads and traffic flow are more predictable. if you were driving and have to 50/50 see if person will exercise entitlement or not, the roads will be messed up as such. if you were driving behind the cyclist second guessing if he would slow down and give way to taxi coming out from side road, you would be complaining cyclist is hogging road.in this particular context, yes cyclist should have been more defensive. but laws are such that the unfortunate taxi driver had failed to give way to traffic on main road, and is lawfully in the wrong.",Negative
"you're just ridiculous - side road gives way to main road. no exceptions! people, including you, let their cyclist hate cloud their judgement. obviously the cyclist should have been more defensive and usually smaller vehicle is on losing end but very obviously legally the taxi driver wasn't looking properly.",Negative
pretty much my first thought when reading the portion about the cyclist complaining that no motorist coming to his aid. would have been good but it's not a requirement.,Positive

"i came across two such folk in one of the local cycling fb groups. “but the rider was in the cabbie’s blind spot!” was their prevailing argument, nevermind row, nevermind the drill of inching forward until you visually clear a blind corner, nevermind how the accident unfolded, nevermind how it was a hit n run. can only be the cyclist at fault. when i tried pointing out the aforementioned issues, i was immediately hit with a “bet you don’t drive” and “no license don’t talk”. i guess 2b ain’t a genuine enough license for these folk.",Negative
"not true, cyclist alr cleared the hedges by the time the cabbie made the move.",Negative
one does not assume there are no vehicles in a blind spot when clearing a blind corner. the driver is supposed to inch forward until his line of sight clears the corner and he/she can confirm that there is no oncoming traffic. why else would there be the inclusion of a blind corner within the road circuit at all driving schools? why else would the school even bother teaching the inching forward method?,Negative

"what i said was inferred from your comment, you mentioned that the taxi would have 'sucked thumb and kiasi hit brake if it was an 8 wheeler', this implies that the taxi was cognizant of an oncoming bicycle but chose to proceed. my point is that since the taxi had slowed down at stop line, the cabbie most likely had checked right but missed the cyclist due to the blindspot. yes, if it were a motorcycle the accident might've occurred too, but the same may apply to a low vehicle like perhaps a lambo.yes the taxi driver should've checked more throughly before moving off, but it's not like he proceeded because its a bicycle. he proceeded because he thought there was nobody. which driver will want damage their own car sia if they know got oncoming vehicle.",Positive
"however, a motorcycle is unlikely to be riding so close to the edge of the road and is more likely to be either in the middle of the lane or lane splitting in which he will be even further out away from the plants.in this case it is likely the motorcycle is easily more visible.",Positive
"fully agree with your point of view, that is simply defensive driving. which the cyclist should be riding more defensively, but i was more emphasising that he should not be expected to give way to cars from the side road.similarly. i'm sure you are slowing down in case of situation where drivers just rush out (being defensive) but not coming to a stop (letting traffic flow predictably as it should).ideally, more drivers should be like you.",Positive

"> charging is cheaper... and for the taxi uncles, money is money.while it does look like charging is cheaper, my concern (because my uncle was a taxi driver) is how long it takes for them to charge, and whether they can get enough travel range in a short time. they might not need to do 0-100% charging often (as the 80-100% takes a lot longer than just charging 0-80% by percentage charge per minute), but how long do they need to charge for sufficient range if they're about to hit peak hour? for new technology especially, the taxi uncles may not know how to calculate and we'll either get even more pissed off uncles, or stranded taxis.",Positive
"i firmly believe that electricity at ev charging stations will be artificially propped up. remember during cb last year when global oil prices were negative? the global market was as such: oil production didn’t slow down in time and inventory piled up, coupled with low demand due to global lockdown and oil retailers were spending millions in storage fees for no revenue. thus many manufacturers were even paying retailers (negative prices) to take the excess oil off them, even going to the extent of burning millions of barrels of oil due to the unprofitability of storing it. meanwhile the oil market in singapore: oil prices stagnant at 2$/lthus i posit that car fuel (oil or electricity) will subjected to a “luxury tax” (because only the wealthy can drive it, according to some) so regardless of market conditions and like coe, the electricity at charging stations would probably be artificially high.",Positive

"comfortdelgro should have just seeked for retrieval of the unpaid fares cause technically little to no damage was done. hopefully he can get a lawyer to help him cause it seems quite unfair despite him being greedy trying to profit from it.the retrieval of the unpaid fares would negate all profits made and technically still punish the individual as he have to pay for the fares incurred from others rides. they didn't have to mess up one individual's life who happen to find a ""cheat code"".in the same aspect with online game bugs that messes up the game's economy, you aren't going to get brought to court cause it isn't the player's fault. they could ban you at most cause you broke the terms and that's it. technically this causes even more damage than the comfortdelgro's case.",Positive

"this group has been identified as the zouk family. this family was supposedly founded by a female that's believed to be from the bishan family, and a lone male that's suspected to be from the marina family. previously, he had been seen in various areas around town, like the botanic gardens, tanglin, orchard, and kim seng. so they're already a lot more urbanised compared to other clans living in other parts of singapore.they're known as the zouk family because the first litter of pups was born along the singapore river, near jiak kim bridge, at the end of 2018. this group, comprising the parents ('zouk mum' and 'zouk dad'), 3 pups, and an adult female that's believed to be the mother's sister ('zouk aunt'), were eventually driven away from the area in may 2019 by the bishan family, popped up along [bukit timah road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/otters-spotted-at-bukit-timah-group-fled-from-singapore-river-home-due-to-bishan-otters) and alexandra canal, then returned to the singapore river for a while.in june 2019, they [stopped traffic in the cbd](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/family-otters-attempt-cross-road-central-business-district), then fled to rochor canal. after that incident, the zouk family was found along bukit timah road. zouk mum was wounded, but was still active enough that she eluded a rescue attempt, and zouk aunt was missing. it's not known whether the group had been attacked by a rival family, or if there was some internal conflict, but as the remaining 5 members of the zouk family continued wandering about places like rochor canal, singapore river, and the botanic gardens, a lone female otter with injuries was seen along the bukit timah and alexandra canals, and subsequently identified as the missing zouk aunt. she paired up with a lone male, and eventually recovered. a few months later, zouk aunt finally crossed paths with the rest of the zouk family along the singapore river, but it was not a happy reunion. there was a fight between her and her sister, and she was driven away. so the former zouk aunt and her partner have been keeping to themselves, mostly staying out of the way of the other families; one possible encounter was in may 2020, when u/hanamihoshi saw [a pair of otters in kallang](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/grkeoh/happy_world_otter_day_heres_a_video_of_2_cheeky/). at the end of 2019, the rest of the zouk family made a den in the botanic gardens, and had a second litter. 6 pups were born, but 3 pups died from malnourishment. subsequently, as the remaining pups grew up, the zouk family started wandering out of the botanic gardens, and another young pup went missing. this family of 7 was seen in more areas; for example, the otters seen by u/sleeplessathome [doing laps in the pool at park infinia](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ff8d6n/otters_invade_condo_steal_koi_fish_bring_to_pool/) were identified as the zouk family, and they were spotted at nearby [tan tock seng hospital](https://mothership.sg/2020/03/otters-tan-tock-seng-hospital/). during the circuit breaker, the zouk otters made notable appearances at the [shell station along bukit timah road](https://mothership.sg/2020/04/otters-bukit-timah-shell-station/), [kk hospital](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/otter-kk-womens-childrens-hospital/), and [little india](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/family-of-otters-frolicking-outside-mustafa-centre-is-looking-for-a-permanent-home). they travelled up to bishan-ang mo kio park, [fought the marina otters](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/otters-fight-bishan-ang-mo-kio-park/), and possibly [raided the ponds at jazreel low's spa](https://www.todayonline.com/8days/sceneandheard/celebrities/former-actress-jazreel-low-doesnt-want-otters-ate-over-100-her) there. after the circuit breaker, u/blackchilli saw them [outside plaza singapura](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hdl50l/otters_at_plaza_singapura/) in june, and pm lee wrote [about otters at the istana](https://mothership.sg/2020/06/pm-lee-otters-istana/) - turns out that it was the zouk family.by the end of 2020, they were back at the botanic gardens, and had a 3rd litter of 7 pups. and now they're venturing out of the gardens again, exploring the rest of their territory; they've popped up at dempsey, queensway, [penang road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/otterly-delightful-surprise-for-office-workers-at-penang-road), and as this video shows, went to the istana again. right now they're back at the singapore river.while the bishan family has been the most famous family for several years, right now it seems that the zouk family has been getting the most public attention as they try to navigate the city.",Positive

"> # taxi, private-hire drivers to get 300,000 masks for passengers amid coronavirus fears> singapore: taxi and private-hire drivers in singapore are set to be issued with 300,000 masks that they can offer to passengers who are unwell, said the land transport authority (lta), as the country ramps up its defence against the global coronavirus outbreak.> from tuesday (feb 11), 300,000 surgical masks will be distributed to the drivers via their taxi and ride-hailing companies in packs of four, said lta in a press release.> advertisement> advertisement> these masks are intended for drivers to offer to passengers who are unwell, but do not have a mask and need a ride to seek medical attention.> ""passengers should also play their part. in particular, passengers who are unwell are reminded to be socially responsible and don a mask, before their taxi or private-hire car ride,"" said lta.> advertisement> advertisement> as part of precautionary measures, drivers have also been asked to take their temperature twice a day.> from tuesday, eight temperature screening stations will be set up at the premises of the seven taxi companies here.> taxi drivers whose temperatures fall within the acceptable range will receive a sticker for the day, to indicate that they are well.> private-hire drivers will be required to take their own temperatures and submit their readings via the app.> the lta, together with the national taxi association (nta) and the national private hire vehicle association (nphva), will progressively increase the number of temperature screening stations in singapore for all drivers, said lta.> these measures come after a taxi driver and a private-hire car driver were among seven new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus announced on saturday.> neither had any known links to other cases.> the lta said then that it was working with operators to ramp up cleaning and hygiene measures.> it also advised drivers to wind down their windows after trips to ventilate their vehicles, as well as clean and disinfect their cars more regularly.> earlier this month, a care package was announced for both taxi and private-hire drivers who are quarantined due to the virus.> these drivers are eligible for a s$100 per day allowance from the government during the time they are quarantined.> all taxi operators, as well as private-hire firms gojek, grab and ryde, have said they will waive vehicle rental fees for quarantined drivers.> all taxi operators, as well as gojek, grab, ryde and tada, have also committed to a one-off allowance of at least s$100 for quarantined drivers.> meanwhile, drivers who are members of either the nta or the nphva are also eligible for a one-off allowance of s$200.> measures aimed at restoring confidence in taxis, private-hire cars> on monday, senior minister of state for transport janil puthucheary met with about 40 taxi and private-hire drivers at the devan nair institute for employment and employability, to discuss their concerns following the news of the two infected drivers.> speaking to the media after the session, dr janil said drivers he spoke to were concerned about how to sustain their livelihoods in light of the current crisis.> the measures announced today are aimed at restoring confidence in the industry, he noted.> “passengers need to find a way to be confident in the vehicle and driver that’s picking them up,” he said.> noting reports of commuters finding it hard to get rides at locations such as hospitals, dr janil said it was understandable that drivers might feel anxious about picking up passengers who are unwell.> however, drivers should have no qualms ferrying passengers who are sick but wearing masks, he said.> “if there are nurses and healthcare workers that need to get home after a late night shift, i’ve asked (the drivers) to help us get these frontline workers home and have some rest,” he said.> dr janil also debunked reports that suggested the novel coronavirus was airborne, noting the chinese government itself had said the virus was not airborne.> “all the evidence currently points to this virus being spread by droplets, not airborne, and that is what is determining the way we address it.”> he acknowledged that the measures announced could be abused, for example by drivers who claim the masks for themselves instead of giving them out to sick passengers.> “i think we have to accept in good faith that (drivers) will look after themselves and the people around them.”> while there are other broad-based financial measures in the works to protect the livelihoods of drivers, dr janil said it was premature to announce anything at this stage.> drivers concerned about getting infected> mr harry ng, 61, said his daily earnings had dropped about 20 per cent in the two weeks since the first coronavirus cases were announced here.> however, the impact was much worse during the sars crisis in 2003, when passengers were few and far between, said the cabbie of 25 years.> drivers are concerned about getting infected, as well as passing the infection down to their families, said nta president raymond ong.> “the fear is there,” said the 60-year-old, who has been a taxi driver for 20 years.> drivers are also hopeful that the government can work together with taxi operators and the nta to ease their financial burden during this period, for example by lowering the cost of renting their vehicles, said mr ong.> the drop in passenger numbers means some drivers struggle to cover costs such as rental and fuel, he noted.> in a statement, mr ang hin kee - who is advisor to both the nta and the nphva - said the two associations were continuing to explore ways to assist drivers who are infected and quarantined with their expenses.> “we are also doing more to ensure that drivers at large are taken care of during this period so that they can continue to deliver safe and quality services to commuters,” he said.> download our app or

"as much as i dislike cyclists that ride errantly, i feel the taxi driver is in the wrong here. the taxi is in a stop lane, it's called a stop lane for a reason. the cyclist had every right of way.to all the cyclists here, go learn about defensive riding. it's a motorcyclist thing that is aimed at keeping us safe on the road, the points will apply to any exposed, small vehicle on the road. just because we have right of way doesn't mean another road user will not violate our right of way. even if you bring the other party to court, it's not worth it to end up having serious injuries and possibly permanent disability. if a truck violates your right of way, you'll still be in a blue tent if you try to fight for your right.",Negative
seems like the hive mind at sgrv have managed to report the video enough to get it taken down,Negative

"wtf is wrong with people? i can’t see anything wrong by the cyclist and the comments are all commenting as if it’s the fault of the cyclist.the taxi actually stopped at the junction before stepping on the gas. if i’m the cyclist, i would have assumed that the taxi would have stopped right there cos it stopped; so there’s no need to slow down, until it was a little too late.if you replace the cyclist with a motorcyclist, it’s 100% the taxi’s fault.",Negative
good that cyclist has a cam.,Positive
"as much as there are many reckless cyclists, the cyclist has the right of way and was the victim here. at the distance between the bicycle and taxi, he couldn't have stopped in time.yes having right of way can still get you injured, but why flame the victim? all the bad apples gave a bad reputation to all cyclists. if the cyclist was a car then the comments would be very different.",Negative
"everyone here commenting about who has the right of way or who is at fault. whereas my response is who the hell cares. sure, everyone has to abide by traffic laws. but first rule of the road is always assume that there will be a mungkok on the road who will make a mistake, whether intentional or not. and always always drive/ride defensively with that thought in your mind. for the record, i believe that the taxi driver is most likely at fault in the eyes of the law. but, at the same time, the cyclist should have had assumed the taxi driver would be an asshole and cut him off and thus, the cyclist should have slowed down at the very least. no use arguing your rights on the road when you're in a blue tent.",Positive

"usually when a taxi gets rammed, the driver will claim loss of income gao gao even for a minor knock.in this case, the cabbie surely go back to work the next day. 😏",Positive
let’s start with this - an accident is an accident. no point to blame so black and white. the taxi driver maybe just did not see the cyclist. it happens. perhaps by definition that’s makes him at fault. but seriously the cyclist was going way too fast for the situation and could have avoided.,Negative
100% agree. being a motorcyclist for over a decade had made me a better and safer cyclist.,Positive
physics does not care about right of way... ride safe,Positive
that video was on sgrv channel wasn't it?,Neutral
the cyclist removed his youtube video. likely he realized he has violated traffic rules after reading all the comments. as the camera clearly shown he saw driver from afar but still sped on.,Positive
"absolutely, it's 100% taxi's fault, and anyone dismissing it because it's a cyclist and not a motor vehicle driver is delusional. additionally, excusing it by saying ""who cares who's at fault, you have to ride safely"" completely ignores the problem at hand - one bad/impatient/aggressive driver is enough to end a cyclist's life, so those at fault need to be held fully accountable (same applies to cyclists who are at fault).the sg road vigilante youtube channel and facebook group are very biased against bicycles, often posting hateful comments with murderous intent - cyclists are humans and equal road users like the rest, and dehumanizing them is very dangerous. i see that these comments are also rampant through this thread, and it saddens me to see so much hate.",Negative
"you should see the fb comments on roads.sg lol. everyone is lambasting the rider when it's a cut and dried case of the taxi not observing right of way. some even claim stuff along the lines of ""how many deaths is it gonna take before cyclists learn that roads aren't meant for them?"". it's pretty vile. and to think that the logo for the group has cyclist, pedestrian, and car in that order. oh, and their name stands for ""respect others and drive safe"". what a crock of bullshit.",Positive

so what traffic rule(s) did the cyclist violate?,Neutral
"not sure if the taxi is allowed to turn right at that junction?i think it’s either 100% driver fault, or just cyclist suay. in the second scenario, it could be that the driver genuinely did not see the cyclist when checking right as the cyclist was keeping to the left side of the road and perhaps blocked by the bushes. moving out for the right turn the driver could then be looking left for the traffic on the other side.",Positive

problem is spandex road hazards are hardly logical,Positive
the cyclist did apply the brakes to a safe degree as soon as he realized the taxi was pulling out.are you saying the cyclist is at fault for... staying on the left side (as legally required) and wearing cycling clothes? that's asinine.,Positive

">you’re right but it’s not the bicycle lane in the first place.  what's your point? motorists can endanger cyclists if they are not on bicycle lanes?you do realize that it is perfectly legal for cyclists to use roads as long as they conform to the same set of traffic rules right?",Positive
>it’s the hobbyist vs the working class debate not necessarily about the traffic ruleshow about a maserati vs a cannondale collision. will be interesting to see where the narrative takes us.,Positive
"i'd have to disagree. i cycle there regularly and that's about the kind of speed you want to be going at, lest you end up hogging the road in front of bus 89 or other goods vehicles ~~heading~~ rushing towards the cargo terminal. driver is 100% at fault in this situation for not observing row and/or recognising oncoming traffic in the form of the cyclist, and also failing to render assistance in the immediate aftermath of the accident. that said, the cyclist should have also practiced some form of defensive riding by not automatically assuming that the taxi would not cut out like that. motorcyclists are also equally at risk of such accidents around that exit (cuz drivers here tend to ignore anything with less than 4 wheels) and those ""in the know"" would pay extra caution when dealing with exiting vehicles.",Negative

no worries! happy to help out.,Positive
"> the taxi stop already. see nothing proceed to move out.... and that's his mistake: he should have seen the cyclist. but even if the cyclist was going at the speed of light while being invisible, he still had priority and hence whoever merge and gets in his way is legally at fault. a stop sign doesn't mean ""stop and just go ignoring everyone else"", it means you wait until it's safe to merge. it clearly wasn't safe.yes the cyclist would have been wise to slow down, but all that would have achieved is a slightly less painful accident.",Positive
"lol. so the cyclist should have rode in the middle and then let motorists complain that cyclists always ""hog"" the lane?thanks for proving my point - it's somehow always the cyclists' fault.",Positive
"just curious, do driving school teach motorcyclists about this? or is this one of those things you learn outside the book? please don’t tell me this is common sense ah, cos common sense is not common.",Negative
"if both are vehicles, it’s confirm chop the taxi’s fault right?",Positive

"1. for those with young kids and no carseats, we have no choice but choose a taxi. if i prefer private car, it’s because i’m without my child and it is cheaper. though normally, i find that taxi drivers are more knowledgeable on routes, on the best food spots around my destination, and more willing to fill you in the latest news/buzz.2. no idea3. if i dont have to choose a taxi, yes.",Positive
"1. yes if it's on business because my company only reimburses regular taxis.  also if i have a ride with multiple stops and wait time because fixed-fare drivers don't like that.2. yes because some taxi uncles aren't comfortable with the technology.3. yes.  usually grab and gojek, and then comfort if they both seem high.",Positive
book the bigger grab option,Neutral
"high fares, exhorbitant rentals and slow adoption of technology. like seriously, why are we paying 3.30 to call a cab in this day and age when it reduces driver idle time?if they refuse to adapt, just let them die, as long as demand is there someone will fill their shoes.",Negative
"i think the author raises a valid point, which is that these disrupters are operating in an unsustainable position, eating through vc money while hoping to transform into a unicorn that will dominate the world, and meanwhile operating companies like comfort have to compete and survive until either they die or the disrupters run out of steam. y'all *do* realise that the endgame of these companies is to be a local monopoly, yes? what makes you think prices or services are better in that monopoly / oligopoly endgame? get great service and awesome products at affordable prices from singtel and starhub, do you?",Positive
"to say that the taxi industry has been disrupted by ride-hailing  firms would be an understatement. decimated may be a better word.in just five years, the industry has witnessed its combined fleet  reduced by 10,000 vehicles - or more than one-third. at just over  18,000, the cab population is now at its smallest in 10 years.and there is no sign of the shrinkage halting, or even slowing down.  at this rate, it is foreseeable that singapore will have fewer than  10,000 taxis by 2025, and 5,000 by 2030.if this ever comes to pass, it would be devastating not only to taxi  operators. commuters will be the poorer for it, because the only thing  that is keeping a check on fares - and service standards - now is the  intense competition between taxi companies and ride-hailing firms.taxi operators have responded to the disruption by setting up  private-hire fleets of their own. these include smrt, prime, trans-cab  and market leader comfortdelgro.while this ""can't fight them, join them"" stance may shore up revenue  in the short term, it may well have a negative impact on their core  business eventually.yet, if these companies do not cannibalise their own business, others  will. it is a conundrum faced by many, including those in the media,  hospitality and travel sectors.by  setting up private-hire units, taxi companies open up a new revenue  stream from hirers who, for one reason or other, do not wish to drive a  cab for a living.it also allows them bigger growth potential, as private-hire  companies can expand their fleets as they see fit. taxi fleet expansion,  however, is controlled.there are several other factors that make operating a private-hire  fleet less costly and less cumbersome than operating a taxi business,  including access to a bigger pool of drivers (no minimum age, unlike for  cabbies), and being able to keep their vehicles longer (no maximum age,  unlike for taxis).as long as the authorities continue to see no need to harmonise  policies and regulations for cabs and private-hire cars, starting up a  private-hire division is a viable way for taxi companies to shore up  flagging revenue. but surely, having a private-hire arm cannot be the only thing taxi  companies can do to win back their lunch. because if that is their only  plan, then the days of taxis are numbered.if that happens, these erstwhile cab companies might find themselves  on shaky ground. even now, they are competing against two big players  that seem to have an inexhaustible supply of investors' funds.it does not matter that grab and gojek remain unprofitable after more  than seven years of operation. investors are still pouring money into  them. as of last year, grab had raised about us$8 billion (s$10.8  billion), while gojek had raised at least us$3.3 billion.none of the taxi players has the luxury of this new business model,  where companies burn through billions without making money, and  seemingly without having to answer to shareholders.it is this unconventional model that has allowed the disruptors to  charge commuters lower fares and drivers lower rentals than what taxi  firms charge. this, of course, cannot go on indefinitely, because  investors will eventually want to see some returns.so taxi operators who swing the pendulum too far towards private-hire  may find themselves in a precarious position when the market reverts to  a more steady state.what that steady state may be is the $64,000 question.but considering that the point-to-point transportation market was  served by 28,000 taxis before private-hire firms started taking root  here, but is now served by around 70,000 vehicles, there is a clear  indication of an oversupply.this number is simply not sustainable without subsidies (from  investors who keep vehicle rentals and fares low). when subsidies dry up  - and they will one day - the market will arrive at a more realistic  number.grab and gojek, of course, have a larger game plan. they have  ventured into several non-transport businesses (either here or abroad),  such as e-payments, food delivery, finance and insurance. each has the  ambition to become a super app.so, even if the private-hire sector undergoes a consolidation, both companies will carry on.#### options for taxi companieswhat about the taxi companies? if they bank too much on the  private-hire business, it may tip their core business to the point of no  return.hence they should expend more energy on preserving the taxi business.  on the whole, this business is still viable, and for several reasons.taxis can do street hails, taxis generally command a higher rental  rate than private-hire cars, taxis are still sought after by commuters  who prefer larger vehicles that are more comfy and can accommodate more  luggage (tourists, for instance).and taxis in most first world cities enjoy a level of trust. they are  also preferred by commuters who do not particularly like surge pricing.what can the taxi industry do to turn the tide, and to reclaim their diminished pie?well, one way would be to join forces. this may not necessarily take  the form of mergers or acquisitions, but rather, an alliance.many years ago, there was an attempt to devise a centralised  call-booking platform that would have allowed commuters to dial one  number to access the nearest available cab among all operators.vendors had found it to be technically feasible. but some taxi  companies, ostensibly out of self-interest, were not in favour of it. in  the end, a poor substitute was offered - commuters dialled one number,  and would be diverted to a cab operator, which would then dispatch a  taxi.obviously, that convoluted proposition did not take off, since it was  easier for commuters to reach the taxi company that could fulfil their  booking most speedily (usually comfortdelgro since it has the largest  fleet).that exercise was done before private-hire firms arrived.  circumstances have changed dramatically since. hence it may be opportune  to revisit it. now, it can even be extended to include a common app  that will dispatch the nearest available cab.with a combined fleet of 18,000 taxis, the industry is in a better  position to compete with the private-hire players than individually.  even comfortdelgro, the largest player with close to around 11,000 cabs,  benefits from an alliance in these dire times.the cab companies may need a nudge to come together. even the first exercise was initiated by the land transport authority.in the bigger scheme of things, it would be in the interest of  singapore to have a point-to-point transportation market that is  sustainable, and which is in line with the country's aim to become  ""car-lite"".a new regulatory framework that is slated to be effective from june  does not seem to address the glaring inequity that has allowed the  private-hire population to grow 70-fold since 2013.consequences of an uneven playing field go far beyond operating cost differences between taxi and private-hire players.besides clearly running contrary to the whole car-lite push, the  situation has implications on public safety. when there is no limit on  fleet size, an oversupply is likely to occur. when there is an  oversupply, commuters are naturally happy. but drivers end up having to  drive longer to make a living. fatigue and higher accident rates can set  in.having no minimum age for private-hire drivers, and no maximum age for their cars, will fuel the same outcome.contrary to popular belief, the market does not always adjust. and  even if it does, it rarely does so in a timely fashion. which is why  singapore has to take active steps to manage the taxi population,  including ensuring it continues to remain viable.",Positive
competition will benefit consumers! and obsolete supplier will be no longer “profitable”. not just a profitability stand point... but the previous service of taxi booking is horrible (and i am glad it is suffering now). there is that “change shift” timing that taxi drivers are notorious for as well.,Positive

i cab once everyday and since the orange level many cabbies/grab drivers now wear mask or wind down windows. i just had one driver yesterday announce when i got on that he has fumigated and disinfected his car. legit could smell the disinfectant. he also told me to stay safe and keep healthy when i got off. i think especially after the recent driver cases they are even more afraid than passengers. so go ahead and request to wind down window. i think they are more concerned the passenger is unhappy if it gets hot.,Positive

i second this point for sure. with how packed public transport still is the measures like queueing one metre apart seem very unhelpful.,Positive
"tbh, grab and taxis are already really cheap now relative to pre-covid 19, even at peak hours. while i agree a form of subsidy is needed, it should be limited to essential front-line medical staff with prove of employment before being entitled to subsidies. one way of doing this is for medical staff to claim daily cab/grab expenses to their hospital/clinics, and the government give out rebates.if the subsidy is given to everyone, then there will be a lack of supply during peak timings when front line medical staff who needs to get to work, can't get transportation. outside of essential medical staff, subsidies given out should come from the private organizations themselves in goodwill.",Neutral
maybe the govt could consider giving all frontline medical/security workers some form of daily transport voucher that allow them to get free rides on taxis1. you somewhat social distance the medical staff from public transport and also free up congestion on trains/buses.2. you help the taxi industry who is currently under utilized.3. a good show of appreciation to the people who are saving lifes daily.,Positive

"this is the wrong way of thinking. you cannot discount the 95% of time adhering to social distancing just because 5% of the time you cant because you're on public transport. you are still lowering transmission in that 95% and that 95% matters alot more than you think.   its not ""all-for-nothing"". its not like you social distance for 23 hours and 1 hour you dont means you die already. that 23 hours matters because you are not spreading the disease in that 23 hours and your chance of contracting is minimised cumulatively.",Positive
"yeah. but not when it's up to 20% of the time for most people spend outside of home. workday is 9 hours including lunch hour, commuting is let's say 1 hour each way. i had work situations where commuting took up 30% of my time outside of home. it's generally way longer than the 30-40minutes you spend eating lunch outside. if we are going to tackle something now, it should be the commute, or the social distancing measures we implement for the relatively shorter lunch times will be lost in the noise.",Positive
"i'm also not discounting the work place measures, these are by far the largest and therefore most important chunk of time we spend outside of home now. unfortunately for the majority of singaporeans, the second largest chunk of time after time at work is time on commute, so we definitely need some measures for this, or it is pointless trying to regulate smaller chunks of time, like lunch hour.",Positive
