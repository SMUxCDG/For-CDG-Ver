"if you want justice, send this feedback to grab. they will suspend and review the driver. the person on grab emergency probably didn't understand the situation fully and just followed sop.",Negative
"most annoying is the trend of drivers selecting that they are already ""here"" whereas in reality they are still minutes away and the damn app starts showing warnings of late fines. well, i'm already here, the driver isn't and it is my fault if he is late?",Negative
"that’s frustrating, especially when you’re sick and not feeling well. should’ve download gojek or delgro app on your phone just in case. i usually check all three fares first before committing to one.also, in case one of the app crashed, you always have another choice.on another note, please email grab and ask for refund (if they’ve charged you). ever since grab updated their app to include grabfood, i find the app crash more often. grabfood now won’t let user to order multiple times at the same time. you’ll need them to deliver your order first, then you can order another. very inconvenient if you want to order from different restaurant. sorry doesn’t mean to rant about grabfood. get well soon!",Positive
"i had this awful experience with grab. me and my friends took grab from a bar to go to a restaurant at night (1 guy 3 girls), somehow the driver wouldnt stop talking otw, she said really nasty and weird stuff implying the girls are hookers (we were talking in mandarin) and asked 'yall are going to a hotel ah?' i felt really offended and reported her to grab right afterwards. to this day i never heard back from grab on this. idk if anything happened to the driver.",Positive
"does anyone else hate grabfood? i don't understand how they can suck so bad, between getting the kitchen to accept and order vs finding a dispatch rider? deliveroo is better in every other way.",Negative
"grab incentives have an acceptance rate of 90%, which means every 10 trips the driver can only cancel 1 trip. if you don't hit the 90%, you simply cannot redeem the incentives which are the bread and butter of the job. hence, alot of drivers that do not want to pickup a passenger due to a change of mind or whatever just leave the booking on until the passenger cancels, so that they don't get affected by cancellation policy. if passenger cancels it's no problem, if driver cancels than its an issue. unfortunately i'm seeing more and more grab drivers doing this, happened to me as well. i suggest redditors to not cancel the booking and let it stay on, while they book another ride-hailing app like gojek to their destination. while on the way, call grab or gojek to make a formal complaint and explain clearly what is driver is trying to do.",Positive
"whenever i get one these drivers that refuse to cancel and obviously not coming, i hail a normal cab or open up gojek. i won’t cancel either.",Positive
"emergency hotline is only used when a riders safety is in serious threat, not for other issues. hence they redirected you to the commercial line aka customer service hotline. how did you find out that the emergency hotline cancelled for the driver?",Negative
i miss uber,Neutral
"similar experience but not rabak to your extent. had an appointment where i needed to walk around 1.5km after getting off mrt to reach destination.(when i got off it was raining...so i booked a just grab. initial eta was 10 minutes. i feel arrival times have went to shit recently, used to frequently get sub 5 minute wait times but never happens now. (whatever, can't blame the driver for being in a inconvenient location, he has to make money right?(wait 15 minutes, joker misses 3 turns on the grab radar. (seriously late.(message him asking if he coming.(he says yes, 2 minutes later proceeds to mark as driver arrived at destination while like 2 streets away, cancels the booking, and charges me the cancellation fee.(end up walking to the damn restaurant in the rain.(generally even tempered but that day i wished for him to catch some rather nasty diseases.update: received a refund.",Negative
"so there was once i took grab 5+ pm, price was quite low and it is normally surge pricing at this point. a driver accepted me and starts to head down to my house but abt 5mins later he cancelled me. abit wtf when he is almost reaching my destination, nvm i aply grab agn but this time price increased by 2$. okay la 2$ close 1 eye i apply again, same grab driver accepted me... wtf? i tot he had some emergencies but same thing happen after a min he go and cancel me. by this time i was quite pissed, you want pick up or not one cb. i go back grab and apply for new one, this is then i realised what the driver wanted to do. the price increased a whooping 10$ from previous to 23$ due to its surge timing now. fker driver waiting surge price and charge me with it",Negative
"try this next time? sms ""book 123456"" to 71222. 123456 being the postal code to pick u up. u get a confirmation of your taxi within 1-2 mins usually. surcharge 2.50-3.50 but it saves u time.",Negative
put on their facebook. it's more effective,Positive
"is it not possible for them to implement something for both driver and passenger to indicate that they are in the vehicle and on the way to location?since drivers already have the button, can passengers also have to avoid such problems?",Neutral
i have similar experience. thru grab app i complained about driver. they called me to apologize and gave me vouchers to compensate the inconvenience.,Negative
"if this is true, please do not let him off.2nd important question, do people expect drivers to immediately use their phone to do cancellations and what not?somethings very wrong here.",Positive
"happens so many times to me... driver never arrives but say pick up already... i cancel but is charged, then have to write feedback, why why why!?",Positive
makes me wonder how reliable grab's helpdesk is if you are overseas and have an actual emergency (e.g. driver taking some weird route; veering away from the intended destination etc....).,Neutral
"alot of them do this, super irresponsible!they just accept, then they horlan until god knows where and expect you to cancel.its some cheat to boost their payout apparently.",Positive
"i've been in this situation befire. just cancel yourself, then report the driver. 100% of the time i get an email or call back from grab clarifying the situation and a promise that the driver will be dealt with. then you can get in with your life.",Neutral
stop using grab? download gojek?,Neutral
"the quality of their services aside, even their app is fucking rubbish. i recall having to download other ride apps because my ns phone (galaxy s5) couldn't run grab and it would just freeze up every damn time.",Negative
"grab's processes and app has been a joke since they appeared to fight uber. i always think that with uber, ride hailing has finally got a system that improves and continues to improve. but with grab, i could see that it was a system that mimics the old ways (favouring cab driver instead of riders, cabbies can choose their passengers)",Positive
"as a grab driver myself, i think it sucks that you had that experience. i myself have been guilty of accepting the ride, and starting the ride, albeit by accident, with the accidental double-tap. but i'd wait for the passenger nonetheless. in such a case, i'd take the ride anyway, like it or not.my experience is that these drivers, old or not, know how to use the app, but feign ignorance anyway. i myself having been a passenger as well have had such experiences in the past. it's quite ridiculous, such drivers. i hear this from some passengers about other drivers, and i'm surprised grab doesn't help them out with such issues either.",Negative
"sorry but grab doesn’t care. this happened to me ages ago and i contacted support over twitter and even their own app (platinum) and they just said they’ll “rectify” the issue and kept giving me the hotline to call, which was just telling me to cancel the ride. the funny thing was, everytime i rebook the ride, i get the same fucking driver. they didn’t provide any follow up, nor did they reimburse me for the time loss in the form of even a future discount, that was when i moved on to uber when it was still around. i used it exclusively until it was sadly bought out by grab and now i’m stuck with this shit service.",Negative
"grab is shit and has always been. their app is shit, their waiting times are shit. uber was a million times better but grab won the price /bribery war even though their product is inferior. i'm so glad i lived in singapore while uber was active there.",Positive
"this sort of happened to me too but to a lesser extent, i was feeling so sick that day but the grab driver came late by like 20min so i cant make it to the clinic earlier",Negative
"bruh, just hail a cab or use another app like gojek or comfort. not saying the driver's behaviour was acceptable but if you're sick af that's what i'd do.",Negative
just use another app - gojek to book while waiting for the cancellation bullshit to finish. simple.,Neutral
"look.. i feel you, and there are a lot of shitty drivers out there. but... seriously you sound like an entitled ass (for which we forgive you since you are sick but still)i hope you feel better soon.1.	you can cancel. you don't need to call them to cancel. i know you were in the right but if you're sick you just should cancel yourself and get on with it2.	the emergency grab number is for emergencies, your driver stuck in traffic isn't an emergency3.	 vote with your wallet. just switch to gojek or regular taxi. grab don't owe you anything and if you're only with them for the grab points , you're the sucker. seriously there are several other options for you. 4.	worst case if you really unwell and can't travel just go to another damn clinic5.	its being childish by threatening to report him. if you want to report him for misconduct just do so and you'll be helping everyone out.",Negative
was it grabshare or justgrab,Neutral
"it perpetuates through out their whole culture. i went for an interview with them for a marketing role. when i arrived at sin ming, they have like at least 10 different small offices. best part? they didn't give me an office number to go to nor did they provide a point of contact. spent 30 minutes under the hot sun going from office a to b to c, only for someone to finally contact me after 30 minutes and ask, ""are you here at office b?"". well, i would be if you provided me with some fucking information.&#x200b;oh it's not over yet. the interviewers then asked me questions that are way out of scope for the role because i have some background knowledge on some other subject matter. (to be fair, i didn't prep for the interview and defo wasn't expecting case interview format)&#x200b;best part? they just ghost me like how their drivers ghost passengers after the interview. no follow up on anything despite me emailing them. i'm kinda glad i didn't end up working in that shit hole of a company.",Positive
is it because you are chinese?,Neutral

"there's always alternatives such as comfort taxi, gojek, bus, mrt.",Neutral
i have this feeling grab will continuously burn money until the next 30 years. i cannot find anyway they will be profitable.,Neutral
"actually, i'm interested to know what actually happened from the driver's point of view. maybe there was someone held him at gun point making him to drive (just being dramatic, but you never know)",Positive
why didn't you just cancel the booking?,Neutral
seems like you took grabshare? since you said dropped off another passenger. sick already still want take grabshare?,Negative
no other clinic to go to?,Negative
"grab should just implement ‘otp codes’. the passenger gets a 4 digit code when they book a grab. driver has to ask the code from passenger, input into the app. this is to confirm that the passenger has boarded the vehicle. no more ghost pickups by driver.",Positive
that's the trend i've noticed lately too!! their intentions are usually good and they just want you both to arrive at the same time but they are starting to stretch that starting time a lot more now.,Positive
"if you pay with cash, you can easily cancel without fear of late fines",Positive
the app should check the gps position of the vehicle! seems like the app is problematic - can drivers and riders rate each other?,Negative
"yeah, this pisses me off. they always say they are there, when i am (and have been) standing at the waiting area for 5 minutes.liars.",Neutral
"gojek is equally bad though.  have had repeated cases where their driver has taken an eternity to start moving after accepting booking, then proceed most of the way to the pickup, not respond to any comms, then cancel without saying anything.  then their app is designed such that you can’t give a rating or feedback on that booking - literally is grayed out.  was an early adopter of these guys as i thought they would solve the uber gap, but am avoiding them now as a result of above.",Positive
"similar thing happened to my gf, she was taking grab to staycay with me and the driver kept insinuating that she was a hooker and lecturing her throughout the whole trip. also didn't help that she was a shitty driver who got honked at at least 5 times on the expressway cuz bitch don't know how to use indicators or drive in a straight line",Positive
"my grabfood app accepted my order, assigned a driver, and then 20 mins after my order was placed (was supposed to get my order 30 mins after order placed, so i was 10 mins away from supposedly getting my food) i received a cancellation with zero explanation. when i contacted their customer service they just said sorry, restaurant was backed up and couldn’t complete my order. shouldn’t they have confirmed this before confirming my order and assigning a driver?????smh.",Positive
wah fuck my double mcspicy got only 1 chicken. maybe the driver eat alr.,Negative
"it depends what area you live in completely. grabfood is amazing where i live, foodpanda is horrible, deliveroo is decent. at my camp, this doesn't apply.",Positive
same shit happened with deliveroo also. 1.5 hrs passed (est 30min) and still assigning a rider. i contacted them through live chat they said theyll cancel the order for me. hello?,Positive
"right on man, need to guard our rights",Positive
"anybody tried not complaining and just not cancel and see who will cancel first, the rider or the driver. i'm wondering if the driver can tahan not canceling if it takes days.",Positive
"i've previously drove grab for several months, what you said is absolutely correct in a driver's perspective. however there's people out there which forces driver to cancel their rides (cuz they didn't want to too \[eg. passengers with baby but booked justgrab, 4passengers with like 4 luggages, passengers that mia for 10-15 mins\]), all these causes drivers to cancel their rides (especially peak hour). so... what could be done better on both ends compared to just on passenger's stand. because at the end of the day, no drivers means no service, right?",Positive
"if they are stuck in traffic that's a dick move, but you're right if they are clearly driving away and not responding to texts or moving then absolutely justified. let them complain to grab and let then check the comms log :)",Positive
"1. i didn’t see an option to cancel midway through a ride, when i’m “in” the car. 2. i’m having a high fever at a time when dengue is increasing, i called because i wanted them to cancel my ride as my driver is a no show, claimed he picked me up, and doesn’t want to cancel. 3. my dumbass hasn’t  used the other apps before and they aren’t on my phone so i’m kind of at fault too  4. yeah i did go to another clinic. 5. i stand by what i did, all he had to do was cancel my ride.thought i might sound like an entitled kid tbh, but the way grab treated me really ticked me off. thanks for caring!",Positive
"the driver already pressed the button to indicate that he had picked up the passenger and started the ride. is it even possible for the passenger to cancel at that point? if the driver hadn’t cheated, it would be like cancelling after you’re already in the car and driven some distance.",Neutral
you know youll need to pay a cancellation fee if you have cancelled idk how many times in the prev week? whats the justification of paying this fee in op's case?,Positive
"entitled ass? akdsfhsadfhkjasd&#x200b;1. op already stated he can't cancel. learn to read.2. if grab doesn't reply at all to things, i don't see why using the emergency number to ask to rectify an already paid service is wrong3. grab owes the op a service because he is a paying customer, now what is wrong with upholding the end of the deal for grab's side? the op wasn't being unreasonable or anything.",Negative
"this 100 times. oh, another god damn rant. i feel for you too, but seriously, this has happened to me before with grab and i didn't wait 20 minutes for the dipshit to arrive. canceled myself a few times and i've never been charged, even if you do get charged, you're in a sick state, just cancel and move on. as the user above mentioned, switch to a different service. the local taxis are decent enough now and grab isn't that cheaper anyway. gojek also works pretty well.thanks for the rant, but it's not going to help you, neither will it change anything, were you expecting us to make this post viral?",Positive
cant cancel once driver indicates he has picked you up.,Neutral
"u can’t cancel midway when the app thinks u are on the way, you don’t know that that’s why you can’t comprehend anything",Neutral
maybe insurance only covers specific clinics? or his regular doctor who alr has his history is at a specific clinic? i don’t think he’d purposely pick some far away clinic for fun one.,Positive
i met this issue in bangkok a lot. lots of drivers would accept and then immediately pm me to cancel.,Neutral
btw is that userid ur nric?i think u can change account already,Neutral
excellent idea if i do say so myself,Positive
or a qr code,Neutral
this is how it works with ride hailing apps in india. the driver has to enter otp from pax before they can start trip,Neutral
let's all feedback to grab. i'm sure r/singapore can make it happen.,Positive
send this idea to grab,Neutral
"not really a bad idea, but in sg there's people who can give wrong otp to drivers which will create a huge rah rah about people saying ""i gave you the correct otp"" and drivers saying ""it's a wrong/invalid otp, i cannot start the ride if the otp is wrong"". first world problems imo",Negative
fucking life protip right here,Negative
"the problem isn't even the app, it's that these people don't act in good faith. pushing the blame to the apps is no different than blaming the government for singaporeans' inconsiderate behavior, they can't bloody engineer everything to force people to be nice no matter how many laws, and even if they could do you really want them to?",Positive
after a couple of bad experiences i've given up completely on grab and gojek. i'd rather pay more but i trust our taxi uncles better.,Positive
"strangely, i've not had a bad experience with gojek, but i've only taken it 10 or 20 times. the only issue is that it's a bit pricey sometimes. sometimes more expensive than grab. but whenever i want to take a direct trip to somewhere (not using grabshare), i'll use gojek.",Negative
did yall report the driver to grab?,Neutral
i feel like they give us these sick 40% off promo codes just to troll us because they can never seem to fulfil their end of the transaction.,Negative
"hahahaha “one for me, one for you, fair” bruh",Positive
after that got ask to use your toilet to ps or not?,Negative
hahahahahaha.,Neutral
same for gojek. drivers were 5 minutes away. ten minutes later they’re still in the same spot. it’s so annoying. they don’t call or text or anything.,Neutral
hence the uber system of passenger rate driver and driver rate passenger is a good one. keep both mindful of being polite,Positive
"i will take a few screenshots of their gps position as well, timestamp is in built too.",Negative
you cancel and claim a refund if you're charged unfairly. i've done it before and never had a problem getting money back,Neutral
oh i see. didn't realise that. annoying!,Neutral
hmm.. i see.. thanks for answering :),Positive
"at the end of the day, if you suay suay get the ""blacklisted"" driver from your blacklist (but not grab's), the same scenario still will happen.",Neutral
when india is ahead of us in infotech we're doing something wrong.,Negative
"just read the otp off the app. how hard can it be? when i was in mumbai on business, i used their local ride hailing app, ola. they used otp method. my first ride i was confused because i didn’t know about that. but subsequently it was easy-peasy. keep the app open and read it out or show to driver.",Negative
well if a person acts in bad faith he should be banned from being a driver on the platform. make it a two strikes rule. to make sure people follow it also maybe levy a fine? maybe keep the deposit or something?if i go to any work place and dick around i would surely get similar treatment and not get my pay as well.not to mention all the drivers are registered with them so they know exactly who these people are.,Positive
yeah. this argument of how grab is bad hurdur and u still take grab? thats retarded lmao. just boycott the company and use something that is reliable and has been reliable for years. if you want to cheap out for afew cents thats ur own fault. taxis has been here for years.,Positive
that could just be their app - it seems really shitty for updating the actual location of the driver or passenger.,Positive
"i was very sad when uber left. i hate these new asian companies which are not customer centric at all, also, they do not seem to be improving and innovating their apps at all. small things like, why do drivers know that riders have applied a coupon, why give riders a choice on pickup (i understand in indo and malaysia this is important because there are fucking hooligan taxi drivers who beat ride hailing drivers that encroach on their turf, fucking shitcunts)",Negative
sounds like unnecessary trouble to go through - not saying its not a viable option though,Negative
yeah it's not like we have a choice of which driver we want to take.,Neutral
"like i've said, i wouldn't think it's a bad idea. but there's people out there taking whichever car services not it-savy to know how to see otp or even check account balances etc. even for someone like you which probably reads reddit have issue about having otp (understandable cuz 1st-timer). but for other people it might not be as easy as picking up such implementation in 1-2 rides, which is a headache for drivers.",Negative
"yeah i’m not too sure what the answer is tbh.  problem is that the whole thing is classic ‘gig economy’ where grab / gojek are exploiting the drivers anyway and creating perverse incentives for particular behaviours.   regardless whether we get charged for late pickup or the driver gets punished for something, you can guarantee the real beneficiaries of it all don’t give a stuff.the times i have actually complained (eg. an uber driver who literally was reading his phone in his lap on the cte), i’ve never come away feeling like they took it seriously or that the consequences for the driver were clear.  and my sense is that being able to directly “punish” drivers through fine or black mark sort of perpetuates the inhuman nature of it all.  it’s remarkable how refreshing it is these days when you get a friendly uncle or a clean professional driver and have an enjoyable ride... that aspect (ie. value exchange between two humans) has become completely lost.sorry bit of a tangent i know...",Positive
people don't value their own time and wellbeing enough. saving a few dollars is not worth the frustration and time wasted if things go wrong with grab/gojek.,Negative
how do i order local taxi from my smartphone?,Neutral
"yeah. its the app. once the car was actually in front of me but the app showed it a street away. then again, it couldn't have been shitty gps on a cheap phone",Positive
i think calling the emergency hotline and fighting the system on principles instead of practicals is unnecessary trouble. just cancel and move on and a quick email to grab while you're in your gojek ride. noting to lose,Negative
"seriously, they give you the otp along with car number and driver name...",Negative
"i don't know, call them? smartphone works as a phone right? if you really need an app, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codigo.comfort",Positive
i doubt it's the phone's fault - it happens too often and seems to be common for everyone i know that's using gojek. that said i'd rather tolerate that issue than deal with the fuck heads at grab.,Negative
interesting to see other people say this. i've noticed the exact same thing with gojek - driver accepts but seems to just sit there for 5-10 minutes,Positive
turn the app off and back on again - sometimes works.,Neutral
bad news for consumers :\,Negative
"well, fuck me.i very much prefer uber. this grab bullshit of letting drivers pick and choose my destination is 100% against why i went away from traditional cabs in the first place.",Positive
i have been reading up on some pretty iffy stuff happening in uber sg https://medium.com/@harison.p.tucosic/after-knowingly-leasing-recalled-cars-in-singapore-tough-questions-for-the-smart-folks-at-uber-f78d4b3111b7. seems like uber sg/se asia are either really incompetent or rife with internal fraud.,Positive

"i use uber throughout se asia. the cars and drivers tend to be better, pricing seems similar to be, and customer support is stellar compared to grab. i tried grab for a little while due to a great promotion they were running, then they never gave me credit nor did they respond to my 2-3 emails about not receiving credit. since then i’ve refused to use grab. if this happens it will really be a shame.",Positive
"personally i find uber to be cheaper most of the time. also i get promo codes almost every week with uber compared to very rarely with grab. if anything, i only use grab for their grabhitch service.",Positive
"there's so much complications, what's gonna happen to comfort's partnership with them?if the sale goes through, does that means the partnership will cease? or will comfort team up with grab? if so, then grab will be the biggest winner. and comfort is gonna relinquish its role to just a vehicle provider company. it's street hire industry is definitely going to be a sunset industry catering to the older group.comfort should use this opportunity to buy over uber sg instead. but this is also an opportunity and risk, having to maintain this it unit, to consistently improve it's logarithms, and it's security. this will be a wholly new field for comfort, deviating from it's usual transport business. they don't really have a choice, not entering the field will result in them being outdated and obselete.",Positive

"ah that's too bad. but neither was exactly a great company anyway and we can hold out hope that when autonomous vehicles get going, there'll be a whole new wave of competitors (google, gm, etc.) entering the market.",Positive
"playing an optimistic devil's advocate here. grab has always sucked up to the drivers to pull them away from uber, at the expense of riders. with uber out of the picture, there is a slim chance that they'll start enforcing customer-friendly policies (such as forced pickup) at the expense of drivers. forced pick up actually makes things much easier for grab (easier time estimation, increased pick ups means increased revenue, etc).either way, with uber out of the way, someone's going to get screwed. either the drivers or the riders. here's hoping it's not both sides.",Positive
this sucks. uber is so much better than grab. especially in getting a taxi faster,Positive
completing grabs monopoly,Neutral
looks like it's lose-lose town for drivers and riders .,Neutral
"services of uber’s scale don’t run on monolithic platforms, i’m not 100% certain but i bet that they run a distributed architecture with frontend distribution node, app router and dedicated services for map, metering, analytics etc..this means if the software is not designed with multi-tenancy, which i doubt it is as uber core business is not being a software provider, it takes a far bit of engr effort to accommodate a new tenant ie; comfort.i seriously doubt they would spend the effort to do that as mentioned, that’s not their core business and it’s easier for them to offload to grab who has their own platform.same concerns for licensing.other issues to consider are legalities, data residency laws: who keeps what data, service level agreeements, maintenance and support to comfort etc..it’s not like buying a game and installing on windows. sure uber can do it if they want to but is it worth their effort?and don’t even mention money, uber is burning money at a rate larger than comfortdelgro’s market cap. they don’t really care about losing money, they are out to change the world.comfort, doubtful they can attract the right talent, you think they have money to burn and compete against startups with stacks of money? they have their core business to take care of",Positive
"so grab started as a ""ride-hailing"" app to simplify the booking process with new technology. after a while changed to 'grab car' or private ride sharing; then partnered with taxi companies to offer 'just grab'; recently stopped the 'grab car' and limit to only high end or limo offers; most recent news is about the acquisition of uber operations and quite likely to push the uber-x to kick out and only stick to uber black as grab premium (or limo rides) and partner with all taxi firms to offer ride booking.one big-circle and back to square-1? ofcourse in the process, lost/spent billions of $$$ and made few billions for founders.so what exactly they achieved ?",Positive
meh this sucks. i never like grab's ui and it's always more expensive for me when i compare grab and uber pricing.,Positive
grab is shit,Negative
i wonder if their underhanded business practices in the us affected demand for their platform here.,Neutral
disaster for uber and american firms in a way.,Neutral
grab doesnt have to buy.  grab already naturally won the war. any longer uber just bleed more cash,Positive
why,Neutral
wdym by that tho why would drivers pick your destination?,Neutral
exactly. i hate the fact that they can choose where i get to travel to when i'm the one paying for the ride.,Negative
willing buyer willing seller. why should one be compelled to bring you to a destination at a given price. current system allows seller to indicate lack of willingness which then raises prices for destination until willingness is achieved. i do believe there is a cap on maximum price so equilibrium may not be achieved,Positive
"the vehicle parallel import industry is rife with fraud and corruption because of the large sums of money involved.the story you linked is probably a reason why they want to sell uber singapore as these shenanigans would raise a lot of unwelcomed attention if they go public.it’s a pity coz uber has great technology , but management seems to be a bunch of out of control cowboys.",Positive
uber is managed by kids who somehow got hired at the right time.,Positive
"it would be more helpful if that medium article was sourced, e.g. by [linking this article when he talks about uber making the application for judicial management](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/uber-owned-firms-case-against-supplier-dismissed). as it is, it's hard to take him at his word.for example, the article says:> jupiter enterprises provides an interesting case study. this company (full name: jupiter enterprises private limited) was incorporated in singapore on march 24, 2016.a quick check on acra shows only one jupiter enterprises pte ltd in singapore, but that company was started in 1981. so how did he get the 2016 date?not saying he's wrong, but it's difficult to verify what he's saying.",Negative
what i hate about grab is the absence of a cancel button which leaves me hanging for 5 min at a time while they still are searching for a driver. meanwhile i could be standing on the side of a road and empty cabs are passing me by.,Negative
"grab has always been leading in the market. uber mostly wins among consumers with the younger generation. the older generation somehow tends to think grab as cheaper and more comfortable with it since they think it's a 'local' brand.sad, because grab is apeshit crap. takes forever to even find a driver because drivers can just choose to reject your call. uber drivers cant do that. oh and another thing, uber doesnt just suspend their customers for no fucking reason at all while sucking up only to their drivers",Negative
yeah grab is shit. their routing and charging algo is pretty bad compared to uber and customer service is pretty bad besides being incompetent.i’ll rather use comfort taxi booking if uber is gone.,Negative
"> their it system is a big mess. their duration estimate is always too optimistic. my email (which is very short and generic) kept getting stolen by people because they didn't see it fit to implement even simple email verification for years. their payment integration with lyft in the us was not implemented properly; mine didn't go through and they blocked my account. their support is hopeless.the irony is that they pay extremely well for singapore, but seem to think that features and good backend engineering are more than enough to mitigate shitty usability.",Positive

"the point of the app is to reduce inefficiencies. i think the point is that by not being picky and almost always driving with a passenger in the car will net you more profit than being picky. so while the driver may refuse to bring a customer to a certain location, it may not be in his best interest in the medium run to do so, as by driving around empty waiting for the “more worth” ride may not be economically smart for him",Positive

"my dad is a fulltime grab driver. he doesn’t reddit and this will be based on a young adult girl still in school. he is the breadwinner of the house. reason he does grab is cause he never did psle so he doesn’t exactly have the knowledge and paper for much else. he did meddle in food businesses as a manager but he got “stabbed in the back” that one time so he isn’t going back to that industry anytime soon. but before grab he was a private hirer driver, basically the same thing but mainly for airport stuff. he drove a taxi as well. so money. uh what he earns is enough to get by but thats it. everyday he gets about 250-300. every week he pays rental but i’m not sure how much it is. there are incentives. but they are a lot harder to achieve than last time but i honestly can’t remember the numbers. honestly if you ask me. my dad should be using the skillsfuture stuff to upgrade and find something better. he has told me he regrets not studying back in school. he did try the security courses but up till now he hasn’t been interested in getting a job in security side. he tried but he just wasn’t down for the jobs there were available and the industry is pretty scummy where some companies have the usual money problem of late pay and odd contracts.",Positive
"no first hand information, but i often ask my grab drivers about this. the predominant patterns i see are:* discipline's important, but so is strategising. the most successful ones are out during the peak hours, such as 0700-1000, 1700-2000, and later in the night from 2200-0100, depending on the day.* incentives are good some months and terrible on others. there's just no good way to gauge. the best drivers commit themselves to a certain level and work towards it. not everyone goes for the highest tier though – some are part timers who are happy to go for tier 2/3 instead of tier 4, but see it as ""maximising their earnings for their time spent"" rather than ""maximising their earnings whatever the cost"".* ultimately, the single biggest factor keeping people are the pay vis-a-vis the time spent, as well as the lock in periods for their car rentals.* nearly all agree that gojek is terrible compared to grab, both in terms of earnings and their algorithms for matching drivers and passengers.",Negative
"i was driving grab full time for 2 weeks last month while waiting for school to start, so i have some experience and hopefully can answer your questions.i drive about 14-16h a day, 7 days a week, typically from 7am-1pm, then 3pm-1am. the peak period starts at around 7am, if you start earlier, there's a chance you might end up in cbd too early and have to go back to the heartland area for better fares. after lunch, things start to quieten down a bit and picks up again at about 4pm, so if you want some rest or shut-eye, this is the best time to do so. the evening peak hours and nights tend to be better in terms of job availability, and i normally drive until i get a job that brings me closer to home, and then go offline from there. on a typical day, i drive about 400-500km.by doing so, i earn a revenue of about high $400s to low $500 a day, but it can sometimes get up to high $500s if it's your lucky day. after deducting rental ($87/day), petrol (~$30/day) and commission (20% of fares which is about $80-$100), i can take home about high $200s to low $300s a day, which works out to be about $20/hr of profit. however, i have to say there is quite a fair bit of day to day variability, which i cannot account for since i have not driven long enough to notice a trend. perhaps other drivers can help you better there. in the 16 days i've worked for, i earned about $4000, and if you maintain for a month, it shouldn't be difficult to earn about $8000, given that there are some days that i did not drive a full day.as for the incentives, the most recent update severely limited what we can earn in terms of incentives, with each gem (think of it as points) giving you $0.40, instead of about $0.85 last time. they also have a rental rebate, which gives you back 6% (i think) of your fares to offset your car rental.gojek is definitely better for incentives, esp the most recent one. if you hit the max target in a day, you get an extra $205 of profit, which is certainly doable if you drive the whole day. they recently upped the incentive, but i haven't checked it out in detail, so i can't help you there.however, i do have to agree with what the others have said. gojek's matching seem to be quite flawed, as i had a few jobs where i had to drive about 10 minutes to get to the customer, and there is some waiting around involved during the lull hours. the fares seem to be lower on gojek as well, but to put it in another perspective, regardless of whether you drive on grab or gojek, the fares of the jobs you get will always be lower since most customers are price sensitive and would opt for the cheaper option anyways.hope this helps clarify! feel free to pm me if you need more info",Positive
"full time grab veteran here. there is absolutely good money still to be made, under certain conditions at least. the biggest one being the often-overlooked one, are you okay with driving a lot. drive to kl non-stop, spend half an hour at a hawker center, drive back. nine hours in the car, does that sound like a lot? because to me, that's tuesday. wednesday, time to do it again...&#x200b;as far as the money goes, i drive a total of about fifty hours a week. which is less than you'd think honestly, because i don't have a commute sucking up time before/after work, and it's potentially spread across seven days, not five. after all car expenses are paid for, i pocket about $1k a week (and of course i get a car to drive, how valuable is that perk to you personally?). imo, the people who can't make that much are doing one of two things wrong. the first/obvious one being driving a car that has crappy fuel mileage. if you're driving for hire full time, most cars have crappy mileage (kilometerage?). grab's two most popular rental cars use less than 7l/100km. if your car uses 10+, that's a lot of money spent wasting fuel. at 10l/100km you're spending over $100 more per week on fuel than i am. is your current car worth spending an extra $400+ a month on? use the right tool for the job.&#x200b;the larger thing that people get wrong (in the sense of ""making less money per hour"") is driving too many lower-income hours. the middle of the day is slow, so working from 7-7 isn't going to get you $30+ an hour. the best times are weekends, like 10am to 11pm (a couple weeks ago i drove seven hours on sunday and got $290 in fares). during the week, the best times are 5:30 -10:30pm. mornings not quite so much so, you got the double whammy of bad traffic, and high downtime whenever you have to drive from downtown to a suburb without a passenger. also it's only busy for about two hours, 7:30-9:30, goes down fast after that. the rest of the hours of the day are well, the rest. so the key to making good money is to get a lot of those hours i listed. seven hours on weekdays (bit more on friday), fourteen on saturday, twelve on sunday. how many of those 62 hours are you willing to work? this isn't a 9-5 job where you hang with your buddies on the evenings. evenings and weekends is where the money's at. if you work a six day week, your day off is monday.&#x200b;as far as the incentives go, well yeah grab just lowered things a bit. that said, they used to adjust the incentives every single week. and in truth, it doesn't matter that much. i mean sure you want to optimize the bonuses when practical, but the incentives are mostly just there to encourage certain hours more than others. and in the long term, the average hourly rate has stayed remarkably constant. early on, when fares were super cheap to attract new customers, and there was a lot of downtime, incentives were higher to compensate. when lta screwed up the rollout of the pdvl license, and a lot of drivers got forcibly sidelined, there were surges all the time, and drivers did made more money despite the incentives going down. when grab absorbed uber drivers over the course of two weeks, the price plummeted (despite the conventional opinion, the uber merger made grab far cheaper). but but, you say, weren't prices rising in april and may? yeah, but grab took in the uber drivers back in early march, it only got into the press because of lta in april. and what was happening in april? after seeing a month solid of lower fares, drivers started leaving. a process that accelerated in april and may, then stopped by the end of june, with income having returned to... the same place it was the summer of the previous year. so if grab lowers the incentive too much, some drivers will quit, and surge will go up until income returns to the long-term average.&#x200b;tl;dr: drive the right hours in the right car, make $1k+ a week, learn to eat late dinners.",Positive

"well... the price mechanism can only bring a *fair* allocation of resources by chance, since equity is a normative claim (afaik).the price mechanism fails more often than not in bringing about an *efficient* allocation anyway because the second welfare theorem only guarantees pareto, not allocative efficiency, and kaldor-hicks reallocation can apparently generate non-transitive consumption bundles because voodoo, i guess. also information asymmetry and all that ^*jazz ^hands*tl;dr: your invisible-hands waifu is shit. *shiiiiiiiiit*edit: i'm gonna have to get back on k-h intransivity, [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fpl00004095) seems to be the only source for itedit2: the price mechanism only causes allocative efficiency when a market clears (dd=ss and every buyer pays up to the price they are willing and able to accept), and all externalities are internalized, and no barrier to entry exists such that any producer producing at a quantity that is less than efficient is forced to accept competitors with the same cost structure who are willing and able to supply a larger quantity to lower price. this doesn't happen very much. i mean, it happens, but in certain situations in different markets.the op is unjustifiably being downvoted for pointing out that information asymmetry distorts the market; here, uber and grab know the exact qd and have a good profile of prices the market willing and able to accept. now, if the issue were purely one of price discrimination then it's merely a problem of surplus transfer (i.e. semi-perfect pd) and not of inefficiency, but there's no way to tell. while game theory suggests that price-competing n-polies crumble because any equilibrium outside p=mc incentivizes a player to lower prices by *ϵ* to capture the market, the reality is that capacity constraints (artificial or natural) and search costs cause the market to be allocatively inefficient. the point of all this is to say that price signalling is, without perfect information about the market, a weak proof of efficiency - movement in a theoretical/classical market has clear price signals, but, conversely, a price movement tells you nothing about the allocative efficiency of a market. for example, the cost structure of a monopoly firm may change due to one-time government intervention. dwl worsens because of a larger quantity gap, but no such information is embedded in the price. asset bubbles, too, represent a class of price signals gone awry.",Negative

"that's a pretty comprehensive post. i have two things to ask you.first -- you mention supply and demand. how does grab (or uber) know this well? let me give you a scenario (below).supply: the market has moved beyond its early days. we can have a driver who uses both grab and uber and periodically switches one off. add comfort to the mix and the office goers who have gotten onto grab hitch. add to this a dense city where many factors not applicable to traditional routing affect on-street hailing (uber famously decided to reduce its dependence on google maps for this reason). with these, it is hard to have a *stable* algorithm that predicts and identifies supply.demand: people shop for better prices leading to lost conversions. the app can also be opened for other reasons (checking points) instead of booking a ride. grab would not know when i am looking to book a ride until i press book. same should be the case for uber.second -- you mentioned justification of prices. while i agree that prices can be arbitrary in a competitive market eg the 1000$ iphone, people have a sense of they are willing to pay and what seems expensive. riders might accept a ride - but an exorbitant one *affects their sentiment negatively*. this is much like higher transport prices cause discontent among people.drivers are perhaps a different ballgame - i don't have much insight there.",Positive

"in economics, welfare is often measured by the surplus generated from a particular choice of distribution. for example, in a [classical demand-supply diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/economic-surpluses.svg/350px-economic-surpluses.svg.png), the welfare is the sum of two surpluses, and is maximized when the market clears (i.e., the favored bundle is at the red equilibrium point where the two curves cross). you can prove or see visually that if you deviate from that point, you generate inefficiency by consuming too little, or too much of something - [""deadweight loss""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deadweight_loss).a situation like this - maximized total surplus - is what is known as *allocative efficiency*, where the maximum amount of benefit is achieved per resources you spend.a *pareto efficient* point is different. a pareto efficient point is one where no one party can be made better without making another party worse off. for example, if the economy has ten donuts and we both have five, i cannot make you better off without making me worse off.however, is pareto efficiency also allocatively efficient? let's say i value donuts at 1u each (5u) and you value donuts at 5u each (25u). then, by giving all 10 donuts to you, we increase the total surplus from 30u to 50u. we have obtained an *allocative* improvement by 20u, but only by hurting me by 5u. this happens to be a kaldor-hicks improvement because you can pay me 5+ϵ, and i am now better off by ϵ while you are also better off by 25-ϵ. we have gained both pareto and allocative improvements through a k-h transfer.---the reason i mentioned it is because the conclusion that competitive markets are efficient comes from the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics, which briefly states that 1) any walrasian (competitive) equilibrium is pareto efficient, and 2) any pareto efficient point can be accomplished with a combination of endowment redistribution and letting the free market take over. as we can see from the donut example, we had *a* pareto-efficient outcome (5 donuts each), but not necessarily an allocatively efficient outcome (10 donuts to you). in a sense, the price mechanism can fail to generate max efficiency - we didn't include prices, but you can introduce prices, endowment ~~and asymmetry~~ (not needed) to demonstrate this. not all improvements can be k-h improvements. this is a more general statement about price not guaranteeing efficiency, not directly targeted at the taxi market.---in general, any imperfection in the market generates allocative inefficiency. this includes monopoly power, barriers to entry (such as cost or regulations), information asymmetry (where one party knows more than another) and so on. the taxi market here demonstrates all of these factors, which is why the price mechanism can fail to bring about ""efficiency"".one might wonder why, at the beginning, i said that a classical demand-supply leads to efficiency while here, i said that the price mechanism can fail in doing that. the gist of it is that the models are different - when markets are imperfect, one party, either supplier or consumer, has an incentive to deviate from the perfect equilibrium. for example, if i have the power to slash quantity and raise prices, i might do so. you can see such an illustration [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/monopoly-surpluses.svg/326px-monopoly-surpluses.svg.png), where the allocatively efficient point is where blue crosses red. if i do so, i lose the revenue from the bottom yellow triangle, and gain the upper blue square, a net gain for me. the top yellow triangle represents the consumers who were cut out by the price raise; so yellow = total loss. if i were to force the firm to produce at qc on the x-axis, they are forced to sacrifice the top blue square and gain the bottom yellow triangle, but consumers gain the top blue square and the top yellow* triangle, erasing all allocative inefficiency - but at cost to the firm! the price mechanism has generated a pareto efficient point, but we show that allocative improvements can still be made.---the truth, of course, is that transport economics is much more complex than that. but the rule that pricing may be flawed in flawed markets holds. that is not to say that the taxi market is inefficient, simply that there exists a strong potential for it to be. to fix the above, for example, the firm may charge different prices to different people (price discrimination). such is the case for area-based pricing, or student pricing, for example. in this case, the inefficiency is alleviated because everyone gets to use the service, but the benefits are skewed towards the producer/taxi firm.  then it becomes not a problem of efficiency, but of ""fairness"", which is much more subjective.even now, though, you might be able to think of a number of examples of abusing things like student price (reselling, scalping, buying more than you need...), which can re-introduce inefficiency.",Positive

""why?"" to which he said he is on break. ok, i was willing to let it go. but two seconds later, as he slowly went past me, he asked a group of three where they are going, and they said marina bay sands and he allowed them to go into his taxi. i was beyond pissed off. if he was really on break, then don't go and ask any other passengers where they are going, just go to your fucking break.so, i took a photo of the license plate of the taxi (which turned out to be important) as he left the taxi stand.so, when i got home, i called lta hotline to report the incident. i gave an estimate of the time and location of where i was when the incident happened and the scenario as it happened. someone took it down and an lta officer got back to me a few days later via phone to confirm some details.the taxi turd denied this happened and said that based on my reported timeline, given verbally during the taxi hotline, he was at another location as verified from his taxi gps. i insisted to the lta officer that this was not fabricated and i have his taxi registration number and was able to tell the lta officer that the facts of the incident i.e. he was at mbfc, refused my fare, and then went on to send a group of three to marina bay sands. i was told to go to the lta office to get my statement recorded and sign it; which i went there and got that done.when i was at the lta office, i remembered that i took a photo of the taxi license plate.. and i realized that my initial reported timing was ten minutes late. the photo i took had metadata containing location and time. so the lta investigating officer reviewed the timeline and found what i reported had reconciled.lo and behold three weeks later when i asked the lta investigating officer for an update, he reported back to me that the driver was given a fine and suspension, as per the ""scheduled offences under vlps""so, take a stand against these assholes. i encountered too many of them in the past and am just so pissed that whenever i encounter them, i will rinse and repeat the process.. even though it may take about 60 to 90 minutes of my day to go to lta office and lodge a report.",Positive

"i overslept and looked like i was going to miss my driving lesson one morning, so i hailed a cab instead of a bus, hoping to make it on time. the cab driver was a nice malay guy with whom i had a casual conversation with, till he realised i was rushing to the driving centre. he attempted to speed up, albeit safely, to reach as fast as possible but at one traffic light, he looked at me from head to toe through his rear view mirror and asked me if driving centres allowed students to take their lessons while being in shorts. (after the ride i realised i would've been able to but in all the hullabaloo, i was stressed!) so now, my eyes were darting around his car and i was thinking if i could possibly make the timing for my lesson and get a pair of pants! the memorable part comes now, as the driver looks at me, tells me to look behind the head rest and says that i can take his pair of pants for the lesson. he ensured it was clean and all because he uses it for prayers. my initial reaction was ""how am i supposed to give this back to you??"" to which he responded with a ""it's alright"" as if to say my predicament was more important at this moment. so i assuredly took the pants, wore it over my shorts while in his car, and when for my lesson.i didn't have this guy's name, number, car plate number or any type of identification at all! i've never seen nor heard from this driver again but i really hope that there are others like him out there, who would help their passengers out in the spur of the moment, even though they know they'll probably not get any recognition for it. if somewhere, somehow you are reading this though my cab driver, thank you very much for your spontaneity on the day and please do know that you can go for driving lessons in shorts! haha",Positive

"2 trips come to mind.in the dying days of uber, i was taking one driven by an uncle, clearly new to the ride-hailing service system (<3 stars). he pulled up in a beat-up car and i was like, ""uh ok, as long as it gets me home right"". but then when i tried to open the car door, some rubber part that holds the door to the car literally came off. he looked at me like it was no big deal and so i hopped on like an idiot lmaohe was inexperienced with the gps and had to stop at the side of the road just to figure out where we were going, and the trip ended up being 20 mins longer than the usual ride. i was so nervous about falling out of the car that i held on to my seatbelt the entire time. when i alighted i felt pretty bad for him, he didn't seem like a bad guy and he was a careful driver, but i couldn't bring myself to rate him any more than 4 stars.-the second ride was on grabhitch. i believe i'm not the only one to come across eccentric drivers on hitch as they seem so prevalent, whatwith the lack of screening and commitment they have to grab. this guy was well-dressed, maybe mid-30s, and i asked him to pick me up from my poly. he said he couldn't find me, well that's understandable as these school compounds often have confusing layouts. so he instructed me to wait for him at a bus stop outside my poly which was a sweaty 10min walk from where i was. when he finally found me and i boarded, he glanced at me from his rear-view mirror and told me condescendingly, ""you know you're supposed to sit in front beside me in grabhitch? we're not serving you you know, you're just taking a ride with us on the way to our destination."" and i stared back at him not knowing what to do. the car's already moved. should i be asking him to stop in the middle of the road for me to change my seating to somewhere where it is clearly uncomfortable for both of us? he then smiled and said he was joking.then he proceeded to tell me about his racist ideologies. ""it's not that i want to be racist, but i don't pick up indian riders. if their name is english but later when i see they're indian down the road, i'll just cancel the ride."" mind you, he was telling me with such an unearned, proud tone it just baffled me. he said more about malay riders, female drivers, etcetc i felt lowkey threatened being in the car with him. boy have i never been so glad to alight from a car.",Positive

"most of my grab rides involve a lot of idle chatter but one conversation left an indelible impression. this took place some time ago, back when uber was still around. i booked a ride to hougang around 7ish one morning and a lady driver accepted my booking.since it was the weekend, i was curious why she’s already up and about so early, so i asked her. turns out she’s a single mom and she drives an average of 12 to 15 hours a day (with little breaks in between) so she can make enough to raise her son. her mother cares for her boy when she’s working, hence i am assuming she needs to cover her mother’s expenses too. that’s a huge responsibility to shoulder for one person.i told her that what she’s doing is truly commendable, but she needs to take care of her health too. driving such long hours on the road is no joke. besides, fatigue can lead to accidents too. i also learnt that she tends to skip meals when she receives back-to-back bookings on a stretch.before i alighted, i told her that she might be able to make a small fortune if she persists at this rate, but the long-term health risks are hardly worth it. she should also spend more time with her kid before his childhood is forever lost in time.experiences like these remind me that every single driver has a story to tell, good or bad. some drive to pass time, some do it to get by, some do it to raise a family.",Positive

"""no incentives because i chose the highest fares available and my ar drop to 40%.""well if you're driving for grab, that's your mistake right there. right now their passenger rates are really low, so to compensate their driver bonuses are really high. skipping the bonuses is quite a bad idea.i drive regularly for grab, i make about $25 an hour after petrol and grab's incentives (but before considering the rather large cost of a car). you can rent most cars for under $75 a day, so it takes 21 hours a week of driving to pay for the car itself. after that, $5-600 in my pocket per week. a lot of that is the incentives... grab basically controls their driver supply through the incentive systems. no incentive at all is really painful.edit: i don't really know the specifics of the tribecar deal. it might not actually be worth it. but from what i can see, the other half of your problem is that your total # of trips + fares is really awful. during the same time period today, i drove nine trips, total fare of $121.50 (which is actually pretty low), and my incentives should end up somewhere around $35 i think. so if you'd made $155 gross, you'd have netted about $93. not great for six hours, but not awful for a job that lets you sit in aircon and socialize. better than the grease pits of mcds...extra extra edit: why the heck are you making three stops for petrol? that's a huge time sink, given that you're paying so per hour to rent the car. is this some part of tribecar's deal? if so that does suck. if not... refuel once only, on the way back to the car depot.",Positive

last mile connectivity and overall transit time are the most important things to me and public transport fails me given where i live/work and travel to often.i said uber's were the problem because i assumed (rightly or wrongly) that if you remove uber and grab demand for coe's more of those would be in private hands.  not to mention the fact that those coe's would almost certainly be cheaper without uber and grab demand.  private cars don't run for 200-300km a day and the roads would be less congested.,Positive

"they did, though. coe prices started falling as uber ran out of money to compete against grab. before that it was a race to grab as many coes as possible for their private car rental businesses.",Positive
"yeah, i think we have the same principles. but the thing is, public mass transport inherently is less convenient than private hire, and there's not much that can be done to solve that, i don't think. tragedy of the commons - inherently, cars are more convenient than mass transport, but if everyone takes a car, the roads grind to a halt.",Positive
"i love that you mentioned the tragedy of the commons, it is exactly right. as for public transportation the investments in expanded mrt network will definitely help, a lot of studies show that how close you are to a train station has a huge impact on whether you own or use a car. there is also a sizable portion of us who would switch to bicycle given a better infrastructure, if i believe the numbers i see on obikes and mobikes and co. that would considerably reduce the short distance trips that car owners are prone to do here in singapore due to the sunk cost fallacy of paying so much for a car.",Positive
theres hitch groups on telegram thats usually cheaper than grab prices,Negative
"pls try out tada. esp during surge, it tends to be cheaper and drivers don't pay commission",Neutral
"personally, while i am subscribed to the $59 plan (10x$10 vouchers), i find that it isn’t really that much cheaper than go-jek in the long term. the reason for this is because grab rides tend to be expensive. for example, i am effectively paying $6 for $10 a ride, which means savings of $4 per ride. however, i find that grab rides tend to cost $2-3 more than go-jek rides on average. so i am really just saving $1-2 per ride. sometimes, the difference can even be $5 or more. currently, i am a pretty heavy user of ride-sharing as i have an aged parent with leg issues and it’s just too troublesome to use public transport. my advice is that if you feel that ride-sharing is more convenient, then go with it. you will probably want to just compare prices between grab and go-jek and go with the cheaper option. however, in times of surge, i will try and flag a taxi by the road (with varying levels of success). it really depends on the situation, but i will say not to too “loyal” to any one option and simply go with whichever is more viable at that point.",Positive
"in my experience, grab has more often than not been more expensive during non-peak hours compared to gojek or comfortdelgro.",Positive
:0 have you tried those? how far in advance do you need to make a comment or reply in the group to make a successful hitch match?,Positive
"wah i’ve never heard of tada, thanks for the rec! easy to use? i’ll go download to try",Positive
"go jek is cheaper for now because it gives incentive to drivers to pick up low fares, but once they remove all this incentives then go jek would raise up the fare because no driver would pick up the pax",Neutral
makes sense. been checking gojek and it's not that great either sadly... thanks for the advice!,Positive
forgot tts and gas,Neutral
thanks for sharing! do you book comfortdelgro through their app? i know they have one but i’ve never used before... or are you referring to like just hailing?,Positive
"+1 for gojek. i've also been able to talk to a real human to resolve an issue, as opposed to months doing battle with grab's auto-responders and feedback-hostile app. no longer a fan.",Positive
"i used to subscribe to a $9 ‘grab’ ride on telegram. seemed to good to be true, but lots of friends and people were joining it, so i thought why not? the process was simple. pm the admin personally with your location, the drop off location, and time to pick you up. i was planning to go home from zouk one day and messaged the admin only for him to not bother to reply at all. what annoyed me was him asking people to pm him if anyone wanted rides. after that experience, i left the group and primarily stuck to grab",Neutral
"i use these groups pretty often, usually can get a ride for $10-11. but for ulu places prbly stick to grab cause not many would go those areas",Positive
"they try to make their rides cheaper than other apps but i heard its sometimes hard to get a driver. as a part time driver i'm always happy to get tada calls, i rather not pay commission than get a high surge ride with commission.",Positive
"yeah, i suspected that go jek was deliberately keeping their fares low to get more people to use their service, some it’s still harder to call a ride through their app compared to grab. either way, i will take advantage of this for as long as it lasts and then cross that bridge when i get there. 😬",Positive
i’m referring to their app. give it a try.,Neutral
he was suspected to be doing monday laundering lmao,Neutral
"what is hitch groups, can you share?",Neutral
sounds similar to my past experience with ryde. i’ll definitely give it a shot.,Negative
"i will, thanks!!!",Positive
you will be surprised. grab was surging for 30 bucks and i got a comfort ride for 19 bucks last week.,Positive
"get your pdvl first, although some say the tdvl is more worth it",Positive
dont forget to take car maintenance costs and depreciation into any calculations.,Neutral
don’t crash your car. long hours of driving is no joke. the $2k excess can wipe you out for the month.,Negative
have you gotten yr pdvl? it takes awhile,Neutral
"uber driver here.> hours put in daily, how many days weekly and how much income that translates to (rough range)?weekday evenings would probably fetch you about $70-$80. if you drive to 1-2am you might even get $90-$100. **this is before deducting petrol and rental cost**> i assume the surge pricing factors a lot into your earned income. what % of your income comes from ferries then and what % comes from the respective incentive schemes?given that i have 45 incentive trips to meet for my weekday incentive, i would get $95, $120 or even $150 if i met the incentive trips. i don't take into account boost or surge pricing because they are variable.> aside from car rental and petrol costs, what are your other expenses?car wash. vehicle repairs for scratches.> when signing up for either company, any key things to look out for?read what you're signing up for. pay attention to the briefings. many private hire drivers make up their own rules as they go along - like _i must follow gps for uberpool rides_ which is bs. read the in-depth faqs on lion city rental's page if you're unsure of something.",Positive
"[rumour](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/uber-preparing-to-sell-southeast-asia-unit-to-grab.html) has it, uber is selling it's sea branch to grab for a stake in the company.",Neutral
"please verify with iras: i heard petrol and rental costs are not tax-deductible. in other words, your income tax will be based on your fares (not sure inclusive of grab/uber’s cut) and incentives.",Negative
"this is not exactly relevant to your questions, but i thought it would be good to mention.i met a driver who put his stuff in the front seat so that passengers are always forced to sit at the back. he told me the he does that to prevent any accusations of molestation.",Positive
"if you're 30 and above, get a tdvl. the difference between pdvl and tdvl is an additional paper on navigation._but, i have completed my pdvl can i convert it to a tdvl_ - tough luck mate there's [no route to conversion](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltaweb/corp/publictransport/files/faqs_for_phc_drivers.pdf) yet.",Negative
"yeah, after some reviews, tdvl might be a better choice due to lower taxes paid with more claimable business expenses. but i have a family business (now on the downturn) to attend to sometimes so am unsure if i can commit to full-time taxi driving.",Positive
"yes, i'm factoring those in already as i'm evaluating between renting and using the family car for this.",Neutral
"if you rent from lion, no maintenance or depreciation.  only daily rental, petrol and nothing else!",Neutral
"no not yet. i've done a bit more research (firstlane.com.sg) after posting this question thread and found that private hire might not be optimal unless i don't mind paying more taxes. i'm also enquiring with hdt taxis but i expect there to be a waiting list.but being a taxi driver is rather taxing and time consuming because i still have to devote some time to my family business (declining/downturn atm).as for the pdvl, i'm not sure if i want to rent or buy a resale car with more reasonable depreciation. i also have access to a family car which i may convert for use for the private hire.",Positive
"please don't do this, all the drivers i've seen do this are incredibly rude about it. you can just buy a 2nd camera that points inside the car. or a dashcam that has 2 cameras for this purpose. (see: transcend drivepro 520)",Neutral
"tks, that's a good point.",Positive
"eh with tdvl, you can still do phv, just that if you so wish to, you can just rent a cab and like take passengers off the street",Neutral
"reply by minister for transport khaw boon wan:1.     approval must be sought from lta before inward-facing cameras can be installed in taxis and private hire cars. lta will approve the installation if there are sufficient safeguards for passenger's privacy. for taxis, taxi companies have to undertake to ensure that the camera recordings can only be accessed by authorised personnel and will only be used for investigation purposes. private hire car companies that wish to install inward-facing cameras must likewise seek approval from lta and comply with similar requirements.",Neutral
it's cheaper to out stuff in front seat imo,Neutral
"no offense, but the guy was fine. he did not even mention it until i mentioned that i usually sit in the front, and we had a fine chat throughout the trip.nothing wrong with playing safe. it is his car anyway.",Positive
"yes, i'm aware. weighing my options i guess.",Positive
"which is why i refuse to use grab for anything other than ride hailing, better to have multiple small companies than one super big super powerful company.",Positive
grab is a payment / fintech company with transport to lure/keep customers. i hate to say i am impressed with their execution capabilities in such a short span of time.,Negative
"hard to believe their rides business drives lesser gmv compared to everything else given the crazy surge pricing. also surprised that the food business drives better margins, i guess that's true if you don't factor in marketing and coupon subsidies.",Positive
"i prefer competition but let’s get real, gojek wont be it until they expand to what they are having in indo, so for now grab will be rather dominant unless softbank pressure them (actually they are doing it) to turn a profit on their investment in grab.and they recently launched their own grabpay card. you can already see what they are trying to do and i read they are also keen to snap up the digital banking license.so yeah, i guess they are here to stay, like it or not.",Positive
thanks masayoshi-san! money makes anything possible.,Positive
yes. the rental company will provide a spare car.,Neutral
"he is entitled to be made whole, ie as if the accident didn’t happen. he is probably not entitled to loss of rental as he probably don’t rent the vehicle? but he is likely to be entitled to loss of use. he is entitled to loss of earnings if the vehicle is his means of earnings.",Positive
even if it’s 1 day?,Neutral
"ermm i really think depend on the situation. in your case an adhoc repair done asap could at least give him some time off from earnings, but at the same time he could lose some potential earnings too. so its both a lose-lose situation. try to look for those adhoc/2nd hand car repair or look for people selling them. quite a hassle & time consuming.",Negative
how bad was the damage? only the side mirror?,Negative
"the mirror cracked, possibly the light attached to it too. the rest of car was unaffected.",Positive
ask him if really wants to continue driving in the meantime? while u source out for reliable workshop.. have it done during the weekends or something.,Positive
alright thanks!,Positive
stay safe and drive safe!,Positive

i usually close my valve if i'm sitting in front for the reasons you stated and no driver has ever had a problem with it. i don't know why you would need to adjust the fan speed though because closing the valve achieves the same effect without affecting the driver.,Negative
"we singaporeans have become so reliant on air con that we suffocate without it - it’s not even about the temperature anyone, we need to breathe at least 23.7% air con or we die :(",Negative
"if you close the valve/vent they probably wouldn't mind unless it is because they have to reopen it manually after you leave. or they are just following the unspoken rule, when you go into someone else's house you don't mess with their thermostat settings.",Negative
"i’m totally aware that closing the valve achieves the same effect but when i traveling with friends and sit at the back, it is better to lower the fan speed compared to closing all the valve.and also, this is the third time the driver doesn’t allow me to close the valve when i sit in front. instead, they told me to adjust the valve to down position or something. still wondering why all of them like the high fan speed....",Positive
">instead, they told me to adjust the valve to down position or something. still wondering why all of them like the high fan speed....i think this is a reasonable compromise. to lower the ac fan speed for everyone increases the overall temp. i get where you're coming from though. i'm always the one who gets cold and everyone seems to be warm blooded around me.edit: cold to warm (kudos to u/ceilingtowel)",Negative
"i don't know, maybe locals have warmer blood. each time i sit in the back i'm barely able to feel the wind from the front even at full speed.",Positive

my concern is that only the registered driver for the rented car is allowed to drive it.,Neutral
i have been using it with samsung pay since i got the card with no problems. i added the card to my samsung pay and set it as my transit card. used my phone to tap and go. used it for both bus and mrt. the only thing is that they will charge 0.10 cents to your card to make sure you have sufficient value but will refund you accordingly later. i'm still trying it out but so far ok.link to some additional info: https://help.grab.com/passenger/en-sg/360034109512,Positive
if i were you i would sign up for both and use them concurrently to reduce downtime between bookings.,Neutral
i'm not a driver but a customer.imo grab pairs driver and passengers better and usually finds passengers that are close to the driver whereas there's been many times where i've been paired with drivers really far away for gojek (like mountbatten-cbd or tampines-changi airport kind of distance between passenger and driver in some cases idk why).grab has grabshare too if you're interested in that,Positive
