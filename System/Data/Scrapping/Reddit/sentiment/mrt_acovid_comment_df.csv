yup it is strictly illegal during the covid period. it is also illegal to busk in underground tunnels or sheltered areas unless you have explicit permission from the venue manager. no idea why you are getting downvoted.source: am licensed busker,Negative
and you have a job? you just repost shit and lie on reddit you brainlet,Negative
gong xi gong xi,Neutral
"i’m pretty sure that’s because you need a license to busk in singapore. you have to fill in a form and go through an audition at nac. your license will only permit you to busk in areas assigned to you. i did study in a music course when i was younger so i know this because a bunch of my friends went to get one. it’s not difficult to get one but if all you want to do is play music it’ll seem like it‘s more of a hassle than it’s worth.p.s. also, you have to renew your busking license every year.",Positive

telok blangah and labrador park difference is stark. i guess telok blangah near mrt are very old hdb flats or else the new flats would be expensive. i don’t remember labrador park mrt has any hdb nearby.,Positive

lab the highest?,Neutral

is pasir panjang well-known to be atas?,Neutral
"the flats at caldecott are relatively newer and there are future developments coming up. they are a bus ride away to tpy, pretty accessible to different areas by car, has a new brown line coming out soon - making it easier to go to town and to the north. ideally the most central of all the mrt lines - 1 stop away from dt line, 2 stops away from future cross island line, 2 stops away from red line, 4 stops away from purple line, 4 stops away from green line, have yellow and brown line. i frequent this line often and its easy and fast to get to the west or east via green line. saving half the time before the circle line was introduced. i'm not surprised at this price range.",Negative
telok blangah (within 500m near the station anyway) comprises of mostly old hdbs (like 50+ years and below) so their size is higher while prices are lower. think 360k for a corner unit (800 sqft) right next to the mrt low and this is consider overpaying 🙄. 5rms (1200-1300sqft)  are about 600k. the newer estates are much higher though l. 620k for 60sqm 8 mins walk to the mrt. pretty much think the area is a gem if you don’t mind older houses with its location and prices though,Positive
likely small sample size for labrador park (can't remember too many hdbs near there) coupled with the age of telok blangah hdbs.,Positive
"caldecott is very convenient and very new. it has access to circle line (can get to holland v very easily, like 2-3 stops), red line (braddell or via circle line to bishan), it's close to novena, toa payoh, town, and if you go the other way you get to marymount and thompson. i used to stay at toa payoh (opposite caldecott) but attended school in the west, i would get off at the caldecott station and my mom would pick me from there. my travel time would only be about 30 mins max. insanely convenient. it's both close to town and close to the west via the circle line. and also close to paya lebar if you continue taking the circle line.",Negative
"yes, with this map, serangoon looks like the best value ever.",Positive
as far as i know there aren't even any hdbs near labrador mrt so i have no idea how the value is derived.,Positive
"cck in itself is really huge, hence the lrt. most of the further in units are of really old age and in sg, remaining lease is a big factor. and cemetary don't usually deter people too much, i have a grandma who lives at holland close, right behind the cemetery. although that one is kinda small.",Positive

must be all the gays and trans in the bugis area./s,Neutral
possible but unlikely since remaining lease is usually one of the bigger factors for price.,Negative
yes likely. old places (higher sqft) with 40-50 years of remaining leases will give u the low prices,Positive

the hdbs around sengkang mrt are older than the hdbs around buangkok mrt and punggol mrt. punggol is gonna be the hub of the northeast in the next few years as everyone knows; and the hdbs around buangkok mrt are actually in a pretty prime location too. hougang central and sengkang central are equally distant from them. about 500m if i were to estimate,Positive

"aside from economic reasons others cited they basically have limited difference in distance to cbd and punggol is 10x more liveable in my view.sengkang- held together by compassone- otherwise quite soulless looking though new ish, limited nearby famous food, streets, or green spaces. sengkang riverside park quite meh and only on the west borderpunggol- waterway point - safra- waterfront housing - coney island- punggol settlement- cute area with whisk and paddle near lor halus bordering pasir ris- infinite running routes and bike shops",Positive

"could had gotten more than a 2 dollar charge, you got lucky.just let them know if you want to do something involving prop weapons. don't play stupid games you cannot afford to win.  even if there's nobody, there's cctvs. if they review the footage, and they want to charge you with anything, well, no way out",Positive
why you never post this photo on your insta though lol,Positive
"they’re actually good portraits! did you use an 85mm? 70-200m? full frame or apsc? the colours look like it was taken from a sony camera.sorry to be a nag, but one of the basics of professional photography, as advised by my professional photographer buddy, is proper planning and to recce the area before hand. that includes checking where the sun (and shadows) will be at this time of the year, and obtaining all proper approvals beforehand. the photoshoot proper - the fun part - is only like 30% of the effort.i highly recommend the photopills app on an ipad.",Positive

op’s comment says tuas link,Neutral
it’s not illegal to purchase a sword in singapore. there’s a shop at plaza singapura (shop name is caesar’s if i remember correctly) that sells such swords.the issue here is that some person can call the police on you if you carry it exposed in public for potentially alarming the public or something along those lines.,Negative

i'm pretty sure it is (or should be) illegal for most stations all over the world to ban dangerous items.and i have to admit the first thing that came to mind was hmm how did they not get caught. i think us as singaporeans are aware and afraid of the law such that's its the first thing that comes to our mind. which is a good thing but at the same time kinda funny we take pictures like these so seriously,Positive

"you need to understand one thing... singaporean have a trait call kiasi. aka scare to die. so... if they see something unsafe or suspicious, they will call the police. of course, not all singaporean are so kiasi. some are still pretty cool about it, especially since cosplay is so common locally now. just remember that the 'weapon' you carry got to be sheathed and/or properly kept in a bag or case. or just carry a foam sword and walk around with it. you will be safe from harassment by the kiasi ones and the police.",Positive
"those still legally  need a license from the police. whether a license was obtained by the club or not is another thing and doesn't prove its not required, btw. source: i was in one of those clubs",Neutral

looks more like expo mrt actually,Positive
"nah... singaporean has a better understanding of cosplay now, so they leave you alone most of the time. if you are in a rather short and airy cosplay costume, the only worry you have are some men (local/foreign) trying to get a 'shot' of you in a compromising position/angle.we still have incidents of jokers trying to use their hand phone cams at the beach to take photos of ladies in bikinis. i know cause i just went to one of the famous beaches in the south.",Positive

"well, you see...as with all things in life, singapore's success is partly due to its location.in the early 19th century, the dutch had already claimed much of south-east asia. the british statesman sir stanford raffles realized that ships going from the east to the west had to stop by singapore. it was also one of the only places where the dutch hadn't stepped foot in. so, in 1819, raffles set up a post there and eventually gained control of the entire island by 1824. by then, singapore had become a bustling port.so, singapore just got bigger and bigger. but during world war two, it got conquered by the japanese, which started the japanese occupation. from 1942 to 1945, life was hard. but after the usa nuked japan, the japanese retreated. since many people were now homeless and displaced, singapore was now the perfect place to call home.but eventually, the singaporeans got fed up with the british. they started petitioning for more internal government. they slowly gained self-control from the british. but the british still didn't trust singapore to be on its own, as it was such a small country. so, lee kuan yew, the prime minister at the time, decided to merge with the much larger malaya and become malaysia, which would please the british. singapore did so, and gained even more independence.however, malaya disagreed with singapore politically and ethically, and eventually ended up separating from singapore. this left singapore on its own with no natural resources to speak of. lee kuan yew still did not give up. he took this opportunity to reinvent singapore and make it even better than everyone else.in the course of 30 years, singapore was transformed into the clean, well-maintained city we know of today. this has incited a population boom, with countless individuals pouring into this clean slate of a country to start anew and get better jobs.so, in effect, it was due to several unrelated factors that made singapore have the second-densest population in the world, but still have good facilities and housing.&#x200b;\*re-reads post\*wow. what have i done with my life?",Positive

">“from a road safety perspective, it would be ideal for lorries not to carry any passengers in their rear decks,” she said.“but there are very significant practical and operational issues — on top of just cost considerations — which is probably why internationally, it is (a common) practice.”>she said that compared to 10 years ago, further regulatory changes now would cause more “acute pain” to the industry...>“further regulations will likely have impact on the completion of various building projects, from (built-to-order housing and development board projects) to mrts to nursing homes and hospitals, (and it will) spell the demise of some companies and the loss of workers’ livelihoods.”>[the government] also continue to refine its policies and regulations, and will “continue to review the safety rules, engaging the various stakeholders along the way, to see how to enhance these measures further”.>ms he ting ru, mp for sengkang grc, then asked dr khor if there will be studies done on how much costs will be increased if more safety measures are implemented.“we need to understand how much costs will be increased, before we can have a meaningful conversation about whether or not there needs to be further safety measures put in place,” ms he said.>in response, dr khor said that the issue goes “beyond costs”.“at the ground, there are significant real, practical, and operational challenges on top of this cost consideration.”however, she added that to estimate the extra costs in prohibiting the transportation of workers on lorries and goods vehicles, then a detailed study and consultation with the industry will have to be undertaken.she keeps saying the issues go beyond costs, but all that she refers to ultimately boils down to increased costs. despite the year long efforts of the workgroup put together in 2008, they have no idea on the extra costs it will amount to. she mentions that industry feedback formed an important part of the decision to go with what's in place.so, the government has no idea about increased costs, but all the issues they raised boil down to costs, and the industry are averse to more regulations due to increased costs. a simple(r) solution would have been to provide grants to companies in a staggered and long-term manner to phase out the use of lorries to transport people. they idea was first identified over a decade ago, but they still say that they don't want to add more regulations.",Positive

"mci is like dementia-light. older people gets dementia, sometimes because of alzheimer's disease (ad) sometimes not because of dementia but we have no idea why, except ""they are old"". ad is a diagnosis, which requires, diagnostic tests: usually they look for amyloid beta, tau, things like that. it took 30 years of research for us to get to a point where we can know ad when we see it, aka, concrete diagnostic criteriawhy i say it's the last frontier. look at covid, many countries just crush it without drugs or vaccines. it took a year to develop a vaccine while with other earlier respiratory pandemics, it had to be burned out. we stopped sars, imperfectly.  we can deal with most infections fine and even then pandemics aren't as cripplingly terrible. covid isn't ebola-lethal, but people did predict the last ebola outbreak to burn out at 10 millions deaths. with very strong measures (search ""beyond contact tracing""), it was stopped at 4,000 deaths.we can deal with some cancer, if we catch it early enough. the real success of cancer is ""people live long enough to die of something else"" and with every day, cancer treatment advance a bit further.about dementia and ad, ... well the biggest risk factor is age. if you are above 80-85, you have 1 in 3 chance of catching ad. we aren't clear on the mechanism; like i said, it took 30 years just to be able to put into clinical practice concrete diagnosis criteria for ad. we have very few treatment options. it's your body quite literally running out of steam, energy, and life. infection didn't kill you, trauma didn't do it, you survived cancer and bam! your brain start falling apart. well, the current frontier is to stop your brain from slowly falling apart.that's a tall order. however, we got to this point because we have never lived so long before and it's an uncharted territory. that's real advancement for humanity that we have conquered so many lethal diseases.",Positive

"there isn't much you can do once ad takes hold and the research on them is really thin. there is one lady who kept giving lots of speeches and talks at ad conference: she was diagnosed with ad and i mean real stuff with all the markers. she staved off ad by just keep her brain working. reading, translating, playing games, sudoku, etc ...as many people would see for themselves or experienced, the experience of ageing vary widely from people to people. apparently, keeping yourself active both physically and mentally goes a long way towards keeping you healthy in many respects, including dementia. i've once on a taxi where the taxi uncle related his story of being a ship captain all his life and he was doing ok. he then retired and fulfilled his dream of buying the toppest of the line entertainment system and he basically said that it almost ruined his health. he would fall asleep watching tv then wake up with the tv still on ""he didn't know the tv was watching me or i was watching tv"". he had diabetes, weight gain, water retention, etc ... as if he almost died from it. he said ""yeah, i keep working by driving taxi because i have to work or i will get very sick. i don't really need the money, it's nice to have a bit more and travel with my wife; but it's really the health"". people my mothers' age keep telling each others how after their retirement, their sickness start rolling in as they start getting more sedentary.hyberbaric oxygen or even [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hler-zp3fc) that the patients liked when they were teenagers and early 20s appear to work, somewhat. however, they represent the ""quick fix"": ""here take a pill and you'll get better"" mentality of modern healthcare. if you read up on the problems of a ""fee-for-service"" healthcare system it comes up a lot: patients are milked for treatment cost instead of being put on a path towards actually getting better.i can tell you that the most cutting edge in ad research is in the [glymphatic system](https://neurolrespract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42466-021-00102-7), which is a newly discovered system that move fluid across the brain to clear out the junk and waste. a short time ago, people found out that with [pulses of ultrasound](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-evidence-ultrasound-alzheimer-disease.html), the amyloid and tau plaques in the brain can be cleared and this was surprising. the research team was looking at how to use ultrasound to better deliver drugs for ad to the brain of mice but realise that ultrasound alone did the job. now some of the thinking is that ultrasound simply clear the blockages in the glymphatic system and improve waste clearance. kinda amazing how much shit can go wrong when you can't remove the shit waste.now, what can possibly affect or impair the glymphatic system functions in humans to the point of disease? traumatic brain injury is one. the other is ... ok, when is this system the most active and clear the most waste? when you sleep. sleep is the time for your brain to clear out the junk and waste. sleep deprivation is ... bad. who would have thought!so really, doctors have been giving people simple advices for good health and graceful ageing: watch your weight, don't eat too much junk food, eat food, not too much, mostly plant, don't smoke, don't drink, exercise moderately, keep yourself active emotionally, socially, and physically, and have plenty of good sleep.yeah .... but it's hard, you know ....\~ where are them quick fixes at?sometimes, when you really drill down to how medical treatments work, it's mostly to buy patients time and keep them alive so their bodies can fix themselves. we should have a front row seat demonstration with covid. covid vaccines really only trick and use our immune system to work. when you have a disease that trick the immune system, like aids, you can't vaccinate it for shit. so excuse me if i find the idea that we can have a simple and easy solution to alzheimer's disease ridiculous.",Positive

dakota is named after dakota crescent which was in turn named after the dakota dc-3 douglas planes which used to be a common sight at kallang airport. there was a horrible crash in 1946 which a dakota plane crashed at kallang airport during a storm and killed all passengers on board. maybe dakota crescent was so named in rememberence of the incident.,Negative

marina bay mrt. it's nowhere near where marina bay is.bayfront mrt is also confusing - since you don't see that name anywhere else other than bayfront ave. feels like it's only because lta didn't want to name it after private entities.if anything bayfront mrt should have been called marina bay mrt and marina bay mrt should have been called marina south mrt.,Positive

jurong east station but put it at the west,Neutral
this the result reflecting extensive gerrymandering that has been pushed across to mrt naming stations. especially if it is a new station it has to be close to the grc/smc that it is in. marine parade grc includes lorong chuan and serangoon central which are in the centre of the country and nowhere near mp.,Positive

working name for that station was supposed to be hwa chong. but there was alot of protest and lots of letters being written onto st forums to oppose of that working name. thus they chose to name after the founder instead.   shall not go into details why it is not name hc. you can google.,Neutral

paya lebar would be another toapayoh then... just like how bayfront and marina bay used to legitimately have the same chinese name for a week or two,Neutral

"no, i expect an organisation such as smrt to have a proper comms team, the same way i would expect them to have a legal team.from what i observed, today's incident was well handled from a engineering perspective. move trains so that they idle at stations with doors open, and quickly evacuate trains that have stalled.communications leaves much to be desired. at bishan, there was no staff at the platform. nobody knew what was going on. the station was half lit, and escalators were all turned off.the train indicated it would end at marina bay, but the platform display indicated paya lebar. in train announcements were hard to make out, and it was impossible to tell if he said 15 mins delay or 50 mins delay. also, clearly an engineer was speaking as he used terms such as ""traction current"". i know what traction current is, but how many passengers do you think do? there's a reason official smrt comms use the term ""power failure"".finally, in train announcements were very different from the one smrt posted on their twitter feed. communications from occ indicated a 15/50? mins delay while smrt comms indicated no train service. this wasn't a one time thing, with occ announcing that traction current was restored while smrt twitter was still posting no train service.there are certain things that smrt did right; clearly they learnt from previous incidents that it is important not to leave passengers stuck on the train, and today showcased a drastic change in their operating procedures.i also appreciated the constant updates from occ, but it was almost inaudible. finally, i understand the fact that the nsewl went down first, and that staff from the ccl might have been redeployed and it was extremely unfortunate that the ccl went down later, but the mood at bishan ccl basically nobody knew what was going on. the only consolation was that someone was taking to us every 10-15 mins over the pa.anyway, i don't want to give off the wrong impression. i'm, not blaming smrt or anything, i understand that rail services have lots of moving parts, and things do go wrong. i understand the fact that smrt could have negated multiple failures or incidents due to proper planning and procedures, and we will never know about the work they did in those instances. the idea is that i hope they gained some learning points from this incident, like they did in the last major disruption.finally, i'm not hating on the engineer or anything. i understand that that was a stressful time, and tbh, hearing any voice is really really appreciated when you're stuck on a train as you know they still remember about you.(yes, i know he communicated with all trains in the ccl, not my specific train, but my point still stands.)",Positive

but water is a commodity and you'll literally die if you don't drink it.if we're on the topic of transport? singapore is a small country and our roads are already overcrowded. a car is really more of a financial burden than a need. which brings me back to my point that you would save more taking public transport. and if you find that too unreliable? you'd still save tons more taking a cab to work everyday,Positive

"# every day for the last few weeks, i walk by this advertisement in the transit area of bugis mrt, and it's driving me crazy. it's a floor-to-ceiling chinese new year-themed commercial showing off ""classic"" and ""no sugar"" coca-cola. now, i'd like to think of myself as somewhat of an independent, critical thinker, a true zoomerlennial who wasn't influenced by these kinds of simple visual corporate marketing tactics.# but i was wrong. you see, this ad was different. it was playing music.# it was a cheap and soulless melody, a generic jingle in a simple a-b-a musical composition, blasting from an economy-class pair of speakers. the first time i encountered it, i brushed it off as merely a mild distraction. and yet, as a week passed, i found myself beginning to exhibit... unusual behaviours.# i would unconsciously hum that annoying tune to myself, as i worked. i became hypersensitive to any sound of a canned drink opening, and spent work hours researching on whether coca-cola no sugar was truly the healthier choice as they claimed. i caught myself taking long, wistful stares at an entire shelf of beautifully manufactured, glossy coke bottles at ntuc. the pounding within my heart reminded me of my jc days; it was the same feeling i had whenever my crush turned around, glanced and smiled at my right ear with her eyes slightly out of focus.# chinese new year arrived, during which the devil tempted my saf-endorsed resilience and discipline with an endless supply of coke (courtesy of my relatives). i could not bear the suffering any more. my pre-enlightenment self would've been embarrassed and ashamed to be defeated, but as i twisted the tab open and flushed the acidic liquid down my throat i felt only victory. it was euphoric; it was as if i was ready to love again.# my daily routine has since evolved. seeing that now-familiar ad on the way to the east-west line platform would fill me with hope for the day ahead, and a desire to quench my thirst for some freshly carbonated coca-cola™. instead of my outdated habit of 0% sugar diet bubble tea, i would hydrate myself over lunch with what i now believe to be a superior health beverage — 𝕮𝖔𝖈𝖆-𝕮𝖔𝖑𝖆 no sugar™. and at the end of a day of toil, as i made my commute in the opposite direction, i am reminded again that i am returning to a warm, cosy home, where i can crack open an ice-cold, refreshing can of ℂ𝕠𝕔𝕒-ℂ𝕠𝕝𝕒 ℂ𝕝𝕒𝕤𝕤𝕚𝕔® to take my mind off the troubles of the day.# i would like to thank the fantastic team at the coca-cola company's marketing department for bringing me together with what i believe is the love of my life. without that obnoxious ad with its percussive harmonies wearing down at my hardened, cynical mental barrier, i might never have known the joy i now possess. i would never have imagined that coca-cola would bring me happiness and (spiritual) prosperity, just like what that ad promised. i truly feel as if i have been born again, as if i had previously only been a physical shell who have now achieved an inner mental renaissance. from the bottom of my heart, thank you.# edit: there's an rsaf recruitment ad along the travelators now that's getting me real excited, anybody wants to sign on with me?",Positive

i had a disgusting time when i used to travel on 88 to my sec school. sometimes i would encounter a middle aged guy who would sneeze on ppl. sometimes he would sneeze on me if he is standing. if i see him my anxiety level just rises and sometimes i would stand up when i see him and try to get faraway from him.i really don't know what's wrong with him tbh,Negative
"u made me remember the time when i was in ns, and it was difficult for us who were wearing uniform to get a seat on the crowded bus/mrt. sometimes we are tired after booking out but some aunties treat nsf as ppl who are “fit” and are the last priority to get a seat.",Negative
"your story reminds me of this one time i was going to take the bus to go to school. then this lady walks up and mutters ""all these kids don't know how to manage their time properly"" (or smth like that) then she stands at the front of the queue. then the bus just so happens to drive in and everyone (mostly students) starts to go into the bus. this lady just starts straight up screaming ""all late already still walk so slow!"" this was happening at around 7am. like we didn't even do anything and then we got screamed at by some random lady whom no one knows for something we never did. poor girl who was running for the bus also got screamed at. but thankfully this auntie never got onto the bus if she did i think i would've cried.",Negative
"i met an old lady at the train station who asked me for money to take the train. i said i'll buy her the ticket but she kind of insisted on money, so i turned her down. then she walked away shouting that my train would crash and i would die. 😞",Positive
"i wonder what'll happen if you just kept a stoic and ""i'm too tired for this"" kind of thing. not angry, no sign of aggression, no emotion, just like as if you're used to seeing this everyday. i wonder how she'll react, because it seems like she wants a reaction from you",Negative
"this reminds me of that time i was shooting a video under my block for my project. got a tripod and everything and was just shooting the environment when this young lady came out of nowhere and started shouting at me, accusing me of taking photos of her and all (i am a female btw). i had already set up my equipment way before she came so i was perplexed. she was loudly hurling expletives at me and needless to say i was vexed and i started retaliating with the first sentence my mind could think off. ""you also not pretty take photo of you for what"" and asking her to come see the footages. luckily she eventually walked off and i got my peace. but yes, crazy people everywhere.",Negative
it happens several times on me - being shouted or cursed or accused for nothing out of no where by some elderlies.not to be rude but i dont respect people for just being old. so what i did is shout back at them at higher volume and curse them even meanier.9/10 i got my peaceful day,Positive
">old(50-60s), long greying hair(the ends more grey)my friend encountered her too, being scarier seems to do the trick. based on my friend's story, she was screaming at a school kid. my friend wanted to intervene as the kid was starting to sob, but then a buff as fuck full tattoo guy entered the train with his family. they made eye contact and the guy continued to stare at her, so she just kept quiet and got down at yishun.",Positive
"horrible people are everywhere. there used to be this guy on my morning bus ride to the mrt. bus was always ultra-crowded, hard to get on. instead of waiting for a chance to get on the next bus, he would always squeeze in thru the back door, when the bus driver told him to come in thru the front and tap his card, he would always say ""don't worry i'll pay at the next stop"". the problem is the next stop was already the mrt (i assume he would get off there too), not to mention it's a dick move since (a) you're not supposed to enter thru the back and (b) everyone else was trying to get in thru the front and accepting it when they couldn't get on the bus. people would stare and mutter and the bus driver wouldn't know what to do with this man and his thick skin, and would delay maybe a min before deciding this guy wasn't worth it and just drive off.came one fine day, same story, same asshole getting on thru the back door and telling the driver ""not to worry"". driver finally loses it and demands he step off the bus, or go to the front and pay. everyone is packed like sardines, no way he's getting from the back to the front to tap his card. does he step off? no, he stays on and refuses to budge. doesn't say a word. so the war of attrition starts; the driver isn't moving, the door is open, asshole won't move. people start scolding and shouting at him because their commute is being delayed. asshole still won't move. only after a number of people really start losing it with him does he finally step off, defeated. bus ended up 10 mins late to the mrt.interestingly enough i never saw the man after that day. hope he learnt his lesson.",Negative

"just ignore her. she might have mental issues. it never occurred to me that irrational behavior is often due to mental issues, but now that i've studied in new york for some time people do strange things all the time because they have mental issues, and so yea, don't think so much about it. must be untreated mental illness of some sort, nothing to do with you personally.",Negative
"> when i ran to the next mrt to escape this mad lady, i kinda hid behind this indian man wearing an army singlet(combat e) with his gf/wife. i quickly explained my situation, she kinda stopped after i hid behind them. somehow, it reminded me of [this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkymdtbzxgw&ab_channel=drrockso1987)",Negative
"not sure if it was the same old lady i met on the train on the ns line. she boarded from canberra or yishun, i couldn’t remember. she was shouting at people randomly to wear a mask. we are all wearing a mask. i could only hear a little of the commotion since i had my airpods on. there was this group of police (yk usually there’s a team who patrols around) who was on the train as well, one of them asked her kindly if she needed help.she got defensive and asked “what is wrong with me asking people to wear mask!” (and repeats x 5 times) i think the young policeman gave up and just ignored her too. lol.",Positive
"reminds me of my first date some time ago. i was out with my date and waiting for the traffic light when this crazy auntie appeared and started hurling vulgarities at me. i was freaking shooked but was trying to maintain my calmness since it was my first date and i was trying not to screw it up. luckily the auntie went on her own way shortly after.unluckily tho, i didn't get together with the girl in the end..",Positive

"i once saw an old lady pulled down her pant and squat to piss right next to a bus stop near valley point. then she walked 2 steps back to the bus stop, then to my horror, boarded the same bus with me :)once boarded she tapped on an old guy that she decided to sit next to, i guessed to ask for some moolah, but was denied.i feel pity for these people. if they have supportive children or relatives i guess their mental health wouldn't be so damaged.",Positive
reminds me of this [old youtube video](https://youtu.be/yhlqhva5fus).,Positive
"she sounds kind of familiar but she may be a different lady and not the one i encountered. i live near my school but i would take the 59 bus if i could catch it bc i woke up late on accident. if not i would just walk. when i get on, this lady would start screaming at me and scolding me for not walking. she even got my school wrong. once, my form teacher saw it happen, but he just watched it, then recounted the incident in class (didn’t mention my name). maybe the two ladies are related. the lady for me had greyish white hair and was also in her 50s. haven’t seen her since start of circuit breaker though.",Negative

"crazy unhappy middle-aged/old folks everywhere. i guess people like these wasted their youths away without being happy or pursuing their dreams so now that they are old, they can't stand others being happier (or at least appearing happy) than them. they crave interaction and attention and the only way they know is to start a fight indirectly hoping for some form of reactions.",Positive

"look, i've never been a confrontational type, all my friends can attest this. i was perfectly content to ignore her, she inititally stopped. only when she started to record did i get scared i didn't want to make the situation worse, and i was like thinking of the consequences. let's say i man up and start arguing back with her, there would be no use. this type of ppl will just accuse and scold and scream, and she'll say i fought back no respect, if/when she posts on fb or smth she has 1 more thing to slander me with. she's clearly mental at this point why dig my own grave further?im in army yes, im supposed to man up for myself i will agree i could've reacted better. but you should know how public, especially old aunties like her see us nsfs. if i fought and argued back i would've made more trouble for me, and potentially back in camp if my superiors have to deal with this shit.my instinct was to gtfo and leave her behind, i didn't expect to get chased. in that moment i panicked and just followed my gut, which told me to get away from the crazy screaming lady",Positive

"what you did back there was okay. it was fight or flight, and you chose the right decision. had you stayed and tried to confront her it would just give her fuel and she would just upload the video without context. and saf doesn't really care about context, because there would be a video circulating on facebook showing how bad nsfs are. it will give your superiors a headache to deal with it, not sure how they would react about it to you, it would depend on their character.",Negative

its not for a day its after hrs when the station close which is at 11pm. so the filming usually be at that time until 5am when the first train starts running. another time there was a local movie (cant remember which one) shot on the cte underground expressway and they close from midnight to 4 am in the morning. i never said its closed for a day. usually you can use the station to film but only after operational hours and also paying to smrt for a huge some.,Positive

"i am indian and i literally don’t have a single indian friend in my life cause i am always the only indian in any room hence if “people only interacted with their own race “ as you suggested then i would have no friends whatsoever, you shouldn’t limit your interaction to one race, i personally relate more to any singaporean regardless of race more than an actual indian person from india, we singaporean regardless of race have more in common culturally and experience wise compared to non-singaporeans. i can equally relate to a chinese and malay as i don’t limit my interaction to one race and we all go through the same rigorous education system and have a lot in common despite our skin colour differences which is very minute.look what’s happening in the us, based on your logic should the white only interact among other whites, then pls don’t travel to any western counties where you will be the minority, karma will get back at you and the whites will say “ we only want to hang out among ourselves cause we feel uncomfortable hanging out with asians” then later you don’t cry because based on your logic people only interact with among their own races. in a cosmopolitan singapore if you only want to interact with one race, how would you handle clients from all over the world ?",Positive
"you said you prefer to “ hang out with your own race” which mean you prefer to “ not hang out with someone of another race “ so what if there was 10 chinese and 1 malay in a room would all this 10 chinese people only speak among themselves and leave the one malay dude ostracized and all alone due to colour of his skin ?why do you think the hdb racial quotas were introduced in the first place ? the govt introduced it to ensure people of all race will mix along and interact with one another and not be segregated based on their race hence this racial quotas were introduced to prevent formation of racial enclaves which you are suggesting based on your logic of “ preferring to interact with only your race “ undoubtedly will result in the formation of racial enclaves. when one race only interact among themselves they will undoubtedly carry racial prejudices, stereotypes, against another race which they have no interaction with whatsoever.",Neutral

"reasons:1. because thompson line only has 2 additional stops, might be better to clear it immediately when passing woodlands. you spend additional time from woodlands south to woodlands, plus time waiting for the ns train at woodlands, but you save the time travelling from bukit panjang to choa chu kang, the time travelling from cck to woodlands, the time to wait for the lrt at bukit panjang, waiting for the mrt at cck, plus the time walking at cck and bukit panjang (mrt is a distance from lrt, plus you need to tap out)2. changing of train at raffles place is very easy (same platform). so by adding the short detour at raffles place to marina south pier and back to raffles place during the ew leg, you save on the time spent: dhoby ghaut to promanade, promanade to marina bay, marina south pier to dhoby ghaut, waiting for 3 trains, and actually having to tap out and walk from marina bay to marina south pier.3. tanah merah to pasir ris and back is much faster and less complicated than your current plan, especially when the downtown station and the ew station in tampines is not connected (distance to walk and need to tap out). this way, you only add the travel time between tanah merah and simei, but you save the time of waiting for the train 3 times, plus the lengthy changing of lines/tapping out twice at tampines (dtl to ew and back)",Positive

to be honest they screwed up all the design of the old stations. you can compare how they are salvaging by looking at the newer stations of today's time.newer stations have staggered escalator landings so that the opposite-facing crowd would not have to cross each other to get to where they want. in some stations the stairs were also placed so that they are the shortest route to the gantries - reducing the load on the escalators.all these realisations came only after all these years as the trains were not so crowded back then - i would say there were even enough seats for everybody in the 90s.,Negative
"this is actually pretty common in a lot of stations. there seems to be either no thought or very surface level thought given to passenger flow. the whole gantry on the left, escalator on the right thing happens in a fair number of stations and is so stupid.",Positive
"this. i think about #2 all the time whenever i alight at bb mrt on the way home. if you take the staircase down, to go to the exit gantry you have to the turn right, but then if you do that you’ll bump into the people who are taking the upwards escalator because to the right of the staircase is the upwards escalator. thanks for voicing my inner annoyances op.",Positive

"i have a slightly similar gripe with boon lay mrt, you have to go the long way round coming from boon lay bus interchange and when you tap in you have to shove through people getting off the train  to go to the pasir ris direction platform. getting off a joo koon train, you get down to ground level and shove through people before tapping out and going out the big exit-only part to go to the bus interchange. a possible solution is to turn the exit only into a two way entrance/exit, and have the gantries closest to the pasir ris platform be entrance. however, that would shift the collision area to outside the outside of boon lay mrt, near the giant sheltered area. thankfully, the area is spacious and you can go through jp anyway, so i suggest that they switch some exit gantries to entrance gantries.",Positive

"oh nice. btw you can post on r/singaporemrt about this. may i know if you have any idea who was the actual architect of the station? i suggest emailing directly to lta about this and also writing to the straits timesalso, i do agree. from what i managed to read so far, the initial stations are just built quickly with the intention to facilitate crowd movement and stuff. citing:the north-south line, launched in 1987, and the east-west line (1989) were the first mass rapid transit (mrt) lines in singapore.the designs of stations on both lines were basic, with the emphasis more on engineering and safety with simple aesthetics.but a key concern, then and now, has been crowd movement.says mrs sushma goh, director of architecture at the land transport authority (lta): ""one of the most important station design considerations is to facilitate unimpeded passenger movement.""the size of the station platforms, the length of queues forming at fare gates and even the width and height of the entrances are meticulously conceptualised to enhance crowd flow.""the template for the north-south and east-west lines initially had no provisions for lifts, with only one upriding escalator at entrances and two standalone access points into the stations.these stations were subsequently retrofitted in the 2000s to enhance barrier-free accessibility.toa payoh station is not only singapore's first station, but it is also distinguished by a double-volume space featuring a lofty ceiling, not common among the underground stations on the north-south and east-west lines.its capacious platform was later adopted as a common design feature to enhance commuters' experience in the north east line (nel) stations.the nel stations opened in 2003, marking a turning point in singapore's mrt station design.more entrances sited closer to residential areas and leading to underground stations were built, lifts were included from concourse to platform as well as tactile routes, new signage systems, better quality architectural finishes and even integrated community-focused art programmes such as lta's art in transit, which featured artworks created by students and local artists.from that point, singapore's architects kept pushing the design envelope, incorporating wheelchair access and encouraging feedback to guide future designs.",Positive

"placing the exit gantry towards the shopping centre side is good. it allows passengers to leave the station asap. having passengers enter, walk into the passengers coming down, before they can go onto the upwards escalator is indeed dumb.",Positive
there’s actually a good reason for the inconvenience for #2. it’s to avoid creating overcrowding and prevent jamming up the escalator landing which can be dangerous.,Positive
not sure how anything which mentions a cross stream is gud *snickers*,Negative
"the station layout looks similar to tampines, except that there are 3 escalators. but circulation is a lot better because the exits and entrances are not groups into clusters. there are exit and entry turnstiles on both the left and right side. people are spread out when exiting and entering the station.",Positive
first world problems!,Positive
"i don't know the real situation but don't people usually walk on the left making the current arrangement suitable since people enter by the left gantres and exit by the left gantres. your proposed solution might look good on paper but might cause cross-streaming at the entrance which may or may not be worse. then again i have no data or pictures to go by. if you have some picture of the station during peak hour, i think we can get a better view of the situation.",Positive

it’s not like the reclamation is cutting away singapore shoreline. nonetheless singapore is moving away from shipyards. it’s not so profitable with the the amount of labor it demands.also no sinkie gonna work there. even ntu/nus engine grads won’t join keppel/sembcorp anymore. . tuas basin reclamation will only affect some yards along tuas crescent area like drydock world and jsml tuas road . the other yards at pioneer sector 1 and benoi area can remain operating.,Negative

yes because in the context here he initially didn't believe in mask because initially the experts say masks was not necessary.later the experts change their tune.and trump took awhile to accept their changes but eventually got on board.his final stance is wear masks.so associating his previous reluctance to wear mask. you could say the same about dr fauci. the singapore government didn't wear masks until they made mask compulsory.,Negative

i love how the experts are just information involved over time to you. however i believe the expert deliberately put the world in danger because they wanted to save the masks for their medical staff only and made up this crap about how it keeps virus from going out but doesn't protect from coming in.also they fail to think quick enough to suggest home made cloth mask until things got worst.trump is not a medical expert on whether mask is necessary or not.the fact that you give medical experts a pass and hold trump a non medical expert responsible is ridiculous.,Negative

hell i doubt you are even competent enough to understand what you read. i wouldn't be surprised if you saw an old article that says 'there is no evidence of human to human transmission' and then stupidly think that means they are saying 'it is not possible to transmit between humans'>why not immediately simply be honest and say because of shortages of mask for medical workers, please use only home made cloth coverings, any coverings will offer protection.>why lie to the people that wearing surgical mask or n95 mask doesn't offer you protection?fool there was no dishonesty. you simply don't understand the damn situation and instead the closest thing your simple mind can comprehend is that it just be dishonestyou can't seem to comprehend that communication about masks may not be needed came before or the fact that it is fucking common sense that medical workers need masks more then your stupid self. also add on how you seem too incompetent to comprehend that there are different kinds of masks work in different ways.medical workers need proper masks, you don't... the general public is fine with cloth masks, but that isn't suitable for medical workers...  and yet any attempt *by the government and health boards* to stop morons like you from impacting medical workers by stockpiling n95s somehow means dishonesty in your brain?>these are the medical experts. they deliberately lied. put the world in danger. >it's because it backfired in a way where cases increases they 180 and started asking people to use cotton mask.these are governments and health bodies trying to ensure uneducated people like you don't impact healthworkers just because you don't understand. that isn't dishonestyyou want to make out like there was some bullshit scheme with lies when that is not the case. the simple matter is that you seem too stupid to understand what happen and the only way your brain can reconcile it is by wrongly thinking there was dishonesty>prior to this, plenty of medical experts were making angry videos scolding people for using masks, and telling them mask is useless for them. they are right to scold. stupid people like you were stockpiling masks that are meant for medical workers. guess what sherlock, medical workers need them more than the general public. they are front liners who are at the biggest risk of catching the virus... they need them more than a moron who can't even understand that information evolves over time no one was saying it is ""useless"". that is yet again your stupidity doing the talking.again this is very much like my car example. i paint my car red in december and tell you about it. and now that i painted my car blue now idiots like you will think i was lying rather than consider the fact that information changes over time. there was no dishonesty. you simply lack the intelligence to understand the situation >you can spin this however you want but you are basically giving a hall pass to medical experts who lied to us because they were worried about their own lives. it was a situation where they just want to make sure the medical side gets enough supply of masks. there is no spinning. you simply are too stupid to understand the situation and hence now blame medical workers.  no one lied but you're too incompetent to understand that>i still remember when medical experts were lying to the world that mask don't work. i was already commenting on this reddit that they are blatantly lying because they only wanna save their own ass. no one said masks don't work. again your uneducated self most likely can't even understand what you read. if you see an old article saying there is no evidence of human to human transmission, are you stupid enough to think that means it is not possible?>and you choose to be fixated on trump who took awhile to accept the new 180 flip flop from the medical experts? and choose to still focus on the time he didn't believe in masks because this was the experts initial position? >trump who is not a medical expert that you hold responsible for people not wearing masks?>i hold dr fauci responsible.idiot posted a bullshit comment that trump does wear masks. i commented that you exaggerate that claim because there are many times where he doesn't. even now...  very few times has he even worn a mask when in public. but your uneducated self could not comprehend that.you repeat garbage points that i had already explained. were you too stupid to understand or did you ignore them?i don't expect trump to be a medical expert but i do expect him to listen to the medical experts including the who/cdc/fauci. most damn people are not medical experts so it is fucking common sense to rely on the experts. trump didn't and instead attacked them just like moron supporters like you are doingthere was no lies. you are literally too stupid to understand why and too arrogant to even think that you could be wrongthe way you comment it is obvious you severely lack critical thinking skills. such stupidity is a burden and a threat to singapore.you are spew misinformation about masks and pushes it with zero shame. pathetictrump is responsible, but more importantly idiots like you are responsible. it is because of people like you that drag on the pandemic. such stupidity literally impacts other people and the main demographic of such morons are right wing trump supporters like you. the useless potus spends most of his time belittling the experts that its no wonder useless supporters like you blindly follow the same. too uneducated to even see the bullshitnot only did this moron potus not listen to the experts, many times he tried his best to discredit them like you are doing.",Negative

i agree with you on this guy. that’s not what i argue about.but to me it sounds like an excuse what you say about commuters. obvious it was possible. when i had to go to a doctor some months ago i had the coach for myself. now the same situation but the coach is full. why? because the work culture asks for people to show up in office (or the company/managers encourage to do so). what and who is the root cause for this behaviour? surely not “foreigners”. using mrt during peak hours for grocery shopping? yeah this is really necessity and there is no way out. i only go for grocery shopping if i need fresh stuff (and don’t go during peak hours simply because i don’t like the crowded supermarket). the rest is delivery.i am not debating hat there are jobs that require people to commute.,Positive

"omg this!!!! i faced the same issue and from what you mentioned i think we faced the same guy. said guy was super obnoxious and shouted across the mrt exit to get my attention (first encounter i was dumb enough to stop and let him go on his pitch) and despite me repeatedly showing signs that i won’t be buying he kept pushing on his pitch anyway. when i rejected him he gave me the stink eye like i’ve just wasted his time (true, but he also wasted mine) rejected him so much he didn’t want me to leave unless i promise to sign a package with him and i said i’ll contact someone else if i decide to do so. he said only he could do so since he intro me to it and it’s commission based, sales end tmr yada yada then i just fake go collect their contact so “i could ask them”. i kid you not, he said “wah finally got girl ask for my number, i shy” wtf the worst part was thinking i’d have to run into them again since those people parked themselves at the only viable exit from the mrt to the rest of the place. storytel frickin scummy. as others pointed out, got audible got youtube got spotify and i still need u to force ur product into my hands??? pls",Negative

"i learned this trick from my ns buddy. since salespeople are trained to counter your answers, most people first reaction is to say no and that's where they introduce their products to you. or they ignore whatever you say and continue to push their speech through.the trick is to say something random and carry on the conversation while walking. i have personally never tried it but i was with him when he did and it was funny af.salesperson: ""hi there, just finished work?""him: ""strings""salesperson: ""sorry?""him: ""lenovo""salesperson: ""? i'm sorry, my name is ***** and how may i address you?""him: ""just yesterday""salesperson: ""i'm sorry... have you heard of xxxx?""him: ""they announced at 7 i think""by the time he finished, we reached the pedestrian crossing and waved bye to him.",Negative

one way that helps a lot is to reverse the situation in your head:\---let's say you are the storytel salesman and you approach a student telling them about your service. that student politely says no thanks and walks away. what do you do? you move on to the next person to talk to and forget about that student 2 seconds later.  99% of people will forget all about how you rejected them just as how you'd forget in the above situation. the 1% who get offended are not worth your time or energy.   good luck!,Positive

"understand where these folks are coming from. they may appear nice, but if they're trying to poke fun at you and you're feeling stressed as a result, they're probably not as nice as you think.end of the day, this is their job. for most young salesmen, their ethics are still developing. money is priority. they'll push hard, especially if they sense weakness in you.it's going to be tough at first, but understand that you have the innate right to reject anyone - for any reason. next time you get approached, politely smile and wave them away. a product you're genuinely interested in? go ahead, stay and listen. but once again, remember, you have the right to end the conversation anytime.one thought exercise is to imagine yourself as the salesperson. sure, you may be bummed by rejections. but i'm pretty confident - if you were genuinely kind - you wouldn't want to guilt-trip your prospect in buying from you!it might take time to learn to assert yourself, but i'm sure you'll get there in time :)",Positive

"don't let your brain (empathy) tell you what to do. in the end you only end up wasting everyone's time and nobody gets anything out of it.feel the urge to be nice, and show yourself you can defy it and choose to smile, politely decline, and keep walking.sometimes they will use ""foot in the door"" technique;soap salesman: do you have a minute?you: sorry, kind of busysoap salesman: you don't have a minute to wash your hands? (confused expression)or the free gift technique (humans instinctively want to give back when kindness is shown).both are ways to play with psychology. simply experience the urge to comply, and don't actually comply. you save their time as well as your own - you are mistaken if you think you are doing them a favor by talking to them anyway, if you aren't interested in their product. for experienced salesmen they can identify people who are wasting time like that very quickly, and then they have to be nice and play along - which is annoying.when these people give free gifts i just take it, thank them, and continue walking. they usually follow up with ""do you have a minute to try our product"" and i just wave the gift at them and ask if it is actually free. the gift is not gonna be at their expense so don't feel bad.",Positive

"hi.a few suggestions. (i’m just bored, you don’t have to take this seriously)1. transfer time is very vital in an application like this. transfer time actually vary a lot depending on the time of day (say waiting for train can range from 2-7 mins) and the time needed to walk from one platform to the other. google maps actually calculate this quite accurately, if you give it the time of day. 2. perhaps consider adding an option for walking. can reference this also. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hvxy96/guide_transferring_between_mrt_lines/3. comfort can also be considered. sometimes people rather add a few minutes to their travel time if it means they can sit! it’s quite easy to see which stations have empty trains picking up passengers just by looking at the difference in wait times at the board. one that i used to utilise is the west bound train at tanah merah station, where it alternates between the train coming from pasir ris and an empty train roughly from 0630-0730am. 4. a use case for me will be the shortest travelling time. some people like to reach work early (and save perhaps 10-15 mins in travelling time, and be productive in office)for example, iirc, if you take the first train from pasir ris to paya lebar, you can quickly go to the middle platform to take the circle line towards harbourfront. this saves in waiting time, and being the first few trains, they are much faster than normal trains. 5. an additional feature you can try implementing would be the earliest possible time to reach a certain location. say i want to reach beauty world from tampines in the earliest possible time. what’s the best way?a) take the first ewl train from tampines to bugis, take dtl to beauty world.b) take the first ewl train from tampines to paya lebar, transfer to ccl and take to botanical gardens, transfer to dtl to beauty world.c) take the first dtl train from tampines to jalan besar, walk to rochor, continue taking towards beauty world. tbh, the answer is surprisingly none of the above hehehe. in the morning, a delay of even 10 seconds could cascade to additional 20 minutes to your travelling time! it takes some effort (and fitness) to actually get the earliest possible time consistently. 6. or what’s the latest possible time i have to reach a certain station before there’s no more train for me to get home? this could be something niche, but useful. google maps tends to have vastly inaccurate first and last train times and suggest very long bus routes when mrt is still possible…just fyi, some first/last trains timing published online are vastly inaccurate. best is to stalk the station or read the sign outside…",Positive

nice work op! just to add on the discussion here - i don't think dfs works for shortest path problems like this (simple counter example [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/80797/shortest-path-using-dfs-on-weighted-graphs)) but so far i haven't found anything that has shown that it doesn't work correctly on your page. just wanted to point out for future reference!,Positive
"your example does include the idea of backtracking which is implemented in most dfs implementation. although you’re right - dfs will not guarantee the shortest path but it can get you one using the local optimum and hopefully getting you a global optimum (greedy algorithm).i think for such sparse graphs eg. mrt compared to dense graphs eg. bus + mrt, dfs results will not differ much from dijkstra or a* (trust me, i have had both implementations done on my previous projects and they are pretty much the same 95% of the time - though i did not use only time as a weight but rather transfer cost between lines as well!)tldr: but yeah, dfs isn’t ideal but i personally think it gets the job done without learning complicated algorithms like dijkstra or a*.",Positive
"there’s definitely a lot of scope to work on for this project, one of which is the implementation of the shortest path algorithm. that being said, i highly recommend the use of dijkstra’s as it guarantees the shortest path regardless. while it’s easier to retrieve the original path from dfs with topological sort, you’re severely overestimating dijkstra’s difficulty as honey speaking, it’s not that challenging to learn (just a little bit of greedy and priority queue and you’re good to go).

"hi! thanks for your feedback!maybe i’ll take this chance to talk about why i made some design choices and what i agree to be unideal. the central & southern part of the map is undoubtedly too crammed. one thing i learnt these 2 attempts of designing sg’s mrt map is just how much closer the stations are in downtown sg compared to everywhere else, and so the more i blew it up (i.e. exaggerate the distance between downtown stations), the more inaccurate the outer stations will be. see the difference between the [nw sat map](https://i.imgur.com/wfwppxw.jpg), the [nw official map](https://i.imgur.com/vvaqyn1.jpg), and my [nw map](https://i.imgur.com/ienbtye.jpg). this gave a huge headache when designing. i decided to compromise, not blowing it up as much as in the official map. if i were to do this again (i wouldn’t), i’d’ve given myself more space for sure. fair, i myself don’t find it the easiest to read this map. i think it’s a compromise of text size, or readability. i chose this font size because it worked well with the line thickness, any smaller and the line would’ve felt overly thick. maybe if i did planning before diving in 🤔i did produce 2 versions! i chose to share the dark mode version because i know it’s an internet staple. let me know if you’d like the light version!",Positive

"i guess i'll just have to live with it... i haven't slept enough to sugarcoat it, but i have to say i hate this humanist stuff for the most part. have you seen those ergonomic keyboards? they say the hand is supposed to sit a certain way, and they jump through a million hoops to bend equipment to that shape. contours to fit a hand, or thumb screws and wingnuts are one thing. overhauling something into some kind of 4d chess board looking thing is something else entirely.maybe (definitely) it's my problem, but i find it easier to follow a straight line. i find them aesthetically pleasing as well. but ease of use is the topic here. you see a line. you get very simple information. your current point, and the direction the line is pointing. you can scan your eyes across it really fast because you're not changing direction. you see a corner, you change direction once and only once. then you're on a nice straight line again. with  a curve, sure it's easy to drag your eyes across it, because each subsequent point only requires a bit of turning, but your brain is engaged the whole time. with lines and corners, i don't need to worry about anything 99% of the time. just go straight. nothing is easier than that.oh and one more thing. straight things stack and fit together better. as far as i'm concerned, the only manmade non-food things that should be curved are wheels (any rotating object), pipes, and things with the sole purpose of fitting in a hand. not counting negligible radius in corners",Positive

"not true.the new model is where assets are owned by the govt. but smrt does the maintenance. the maintenance fees is included in the bidding package they submitted. the 3 lines hit were those that is not on the new model yet iirc.anyway the new model relieved alot of asset expenditure and is ideal for smrt or sbs since they are only managing operations, they don't even have to fork a cent to buy trains or buses!with that said, i think it is a waste for the government to discard the old siemens trains. they clearly can be retrofitted to last another good 20 years but they just decided to scrap them. not sure why they came up with this decision. is the costs if retrofitting too high? or maintenance costs is too high for old trains? or that because of the incompatibility between the signaling system so they decided to scrap them? this is not really communicated.p.s. i am no train otaku and may be wrong, please do let me know where i am wrong. glad to be corrected by train otakus",Positive

"i find it borderline annoying when there are people sitting on the floor especially at the space right beside the door and the reserved seat. someone might just trip over you. i will only ever recommend sitting on the floor if it’s in the train cabin with no seats and only handles. because you won’t really block people there as long as the train isn’t crowded. i’ll understand if you are just social distancing by sitting there. but please don’t sit on the space between the glass and the door. also, seats are for everyone, no need to be shy about it. students needs seats just as much as everyone else. i lived 1 hour away from my secondary school by mrt few years back. i would snag any seats i could because tampines to toa payoh is tiring af. i will even sit on the reserved seat and keep an eye out for people who need it. an empty seat is just asking to be sat on lol. so please, don’t torture yourself and save some energy by sitting down on your way back to school.",Positive

i think it will look mega weird if there's empty seats and you sit on the floor. just take a seat. people won't judge you unless you outright refuse to give up a seat for a pregnant lady or an old person. there's plenty of able bodied young people who sit on seats too just offer your seat if a needy person come along.i even had a fellow young person offer me a seat before because he saw me in a big backpack and said he knows how tiring school is. lol. super nice.,Positive

if there's a seat park your meat.  as others have said you are paying for the ride. i feel like there's been videos on this exact subject playing in the station and on the train.also don't lean up against the doors (this scares the guy in the videos) and report every bag that someone isn't literally touching.,Negative
"last time when i was young i sat on the floor, but now got covid and people don’t watch where they are going, so better don’t sit on the floor. i have the same feeling as you so i usually just try to aim for those seats in the middle or further away from the entrance, and avoid the reserved seats. usually when i’m extremely tired/ bag is heavy, i will also sit the reserved seats but try not to be asleep. i also try to take seats further from the doors too (like seats in the opposite side of the train doors opening). but in short (i try to tell myself this too): just take any seat you want, you’re a paying customer. although you’re young, you can be tired and need a seat too.",Negative

no its not its actually normal for me at least but due to my anxiety i cant i just cant.,Negative
i sat on the floor when i was a teen but only when a friend or two was with me and it's not crowded. honestly i wouldn't recommend it. just sit on the seats. its meant for everyone including yourself. give it up when you see someone in need of it but other than that you're good.,Positive
at most get stomp only just sit,Positive
"yeah, coming from a working woman i will say please do take a seat if one is available. don’t sit on the floor - it makes women feel uncomfortable especially if the only free space for them to stand is right in front of you. let’s say you sit at the corner between the glass and the door, and the train doors don’t open on that side - it’s still awkward for the people around you if you’re facing them. i wouldn’t want a stranger’s face near my legs for eg. also, i think you’d take up less space if standing than if you were sitting on the floor. fellow commuters won’t look at it as ‘oh, he’s on the floor to save seats for others’. they’re likely to view it in this manner: the amount of space this guy is taking up while on the floor when he could have been standing like any other.",Positive

if there are seats take it if you need to. people who sit on the floor take up unnecessary mindspace (at least for me) as i'm always wondering what's going on in their minds for them to sit on the floor.

just wanna share my solution - a backpack that has a built-in chair frame hidden inside the bag itself.https://www.bagobago.com/from the exterior it looks like a normal bag (you don't see any chair legs) so it just looks like you're sitting on the bag. you can even access the main compartment while sitting on it.it's now my everyday bag. a few times on the i even slept on it on the mrt from jurong east to tampines. i also sit on it at bus stops when all the bus stops seats are wet or taken.,Negative

"it's not that strange. sitting on train floors have been happening for at least 2 decades. that said, the floor is dirty and takes up a lot more space than standing so it's best not to sit. get the glass panel (next to the seat, not the one on the door!) location if you can and lean against it for a more comfortable ride.you also really shouldn't be complaining about old age stuff unless you are at least in your mid-thirties. so your issues are more likely due to lack of sleep or poor sleep quality, and poor sitting posture. if your back feels that bad, it's best to check out the doc. your back can hurt for many other reasons than ""being old"".",Positive

"i think there is somewhat of an attitude that students, because they are young, should let older people sit on the mrt seats (regardless of if it is reserved seating or not), esecially because of the belief that young people are stronger and school isn't that tiring.

never been to hong kong but that does sound more viable. this also reminds me of some of those guardians in front of the gantries at bugis/tampines inside of the station. or even braddel. those i see always got people.but those afterthoughts like you mentioned really fare way worse,Positive
esplanade one is consider a connector between esplanade/marina square/citylink/suntec cityorchard xchange is simply a weird extension where no one will pass by since right out of the station you can choose to go ion/tang/wisma.. i only visit there for kasia mobile and they are the only one expanded to larger store so far..,Positive
basically all the cbd ones with really heavy foot traffic. the one at raffles mrt is bustling on normal weekdays.,Positive
"i always suspected they were trying to mimic the success of shops in jr stations in japan, more specifically shibuya/shinjuku area. but the thing is that those places are always en route to somewhere else, hence the foot traffic. yet those at orchard has no foot traffic at all, it is out of the way to the malls and stuff.",Positive
there are like a few but mostly dont. the city hall that links to esplanade is the most successful example because of foot traffic. think there is another one in cbd area too.but those that do not have foot traffic (dhouby and orchard) should really reconsider.,Positive

i really really like this initiative. my main worry though is how they keep it clean and hygienic.,Positive
nothing like a fresh gooey pile of phlegm on the water cooler drainage to keep me away. how they execute this is really important,Positive
they could change the design so that fresh water comes out of the dispenser without the base (to prevent people from spitting) similar to what i saw in austria where water came out from a tap when you pressed a lever with your foot using a foot pedal. there was no way spit could go back into the water dispenser. design something hygienic and useful. not the water cooler thing we had since the 1980s.,Negative

"""time for her to learn""? she's 45. this isn't a classroom fight between two kids. many of us have ""issues"" of various kinds, but it is our responsibility to handle them without harming innocent people. i think ""you should be more understanding, they just have issues and need time to change!"" is something victims of abuse have heard a lot - it's one thing if someone is so severely impaired that they genuinely cannot make rational decisions, but otherwise we really need to be careful about assuming that everyone who has any problems at all is instantly absolved of responsibility for their actions.the reason fat-shaming is bad (and i agree that it is) is that it also shames other people who are seen as fat, and perpetuates harmful norms about weight in society. not that we need to defend someone who violently lashed out at a young child for zero reason.",Negative
"not that i’m defending her. she’s 45. many people are learning to be a better human at that age. no valid reason can i give for someone to lash out at another, let alone a younger child at that age. what i’m trying to say is, we can’t justify whatever she did. it may even be irrational. but we can’t say for sure that this alleged perpetrator had the resources and guidance to be “taught” how to heal and handle their issues. not everyone have that luxury and i thought we could consider that aspect as well, all for discussion purposes.",Positive

"i agree with you that if she needs counselling of some kind, she should receive it in addition to her punishment, and i also agree that it's possible to talk about rehabilitative measures without justifying or downplaying her actions. however, i'd just like to point out that i think many (most?) of us have not had this ""luxury"" either, whether because of the difficulty and stigma of accessing formal resources like counselling, or because the people who should have given us this guidance are the ones who gave us these issues in the first place (e.g. abusive or toxic parents). but the lessons involved in this incident - violence is bad; someone stepping on your foot is almost certainly an accident and is an incredibly minor issue anyway - are frankly very basic ones that adults shouldn't require special guidance to understand. we are all expected to know these things, because understanding them is within the capabilities of all adults who aren't severely impaired in some way, and because someone who doesn't grasp these basic things and responds violently to trivial, everyday incidents is frankly not a safe person to have in society.again, i agree that rehabilitation is important, and people who have anger management issues or any other problems should receive help, in addition to being held accountable for their actions. but i'd really like to push back on this lowering of the bar, which i don't think you intended but which is unfortunately quite a common way that abusers and victimisers are protected by society - the idea that adults can't be expected to treat others with basic decency unless they have been specifically taught to do so, or that people who do treat others decently (which i'd like to believe is most of us) are only able to do so because they either do not have issues or have had the privilege of receiving help. that is not true - many, many of us do deal with issues of various kinds and have not received help, but still manage not to be violent or aggressive because that is the bare minimum, and because we have the agency to think for ourselves and make choices about how to behave.",Positive

"just as a word of advice to anyone that finds a random strange flash drive.  you should never give it access to a computer that you care about.this could lead to various forms of malware making their way into the device. your computer could get locked up by ransomware or a keylogger could be recording your every keystroke…allowing hackers to get hold of your access credentials to various accounts, ranging from social media to financial institutions.i'm not saying every found usb drive would have this but it's a well known way for someone to gain access.the risk is not worth the good samaritan gain.",Positive

i’d drop it off with the police and fill in the form. if any redditor did lose their keys you can direct them to the police station and be sure the police will check their id.edit: i’ve read your replies to others. it’s still the safest course of action because of accountability. mrt staff will eventually hand it to the police anyway for the same reasons. you do not want to be responsible for the keys falling into wrongful hands.,Positive

"bro, wks is mas selamat saga. people were asking for his head back then.https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/20080422989.htmsee what lhl said:.             the minister is ultimately accountable for the policies and operations of his ministry.  but this does not mean that if a lapse occurs down the line, every level in the chain of command, up to and including the minister should automatically be punished or removed.  based on the facts, we have to decide who fell short in performing his duties, and what is the appropriate disciplinary action for each officer involved.  we also have to follow due process, giving officers the chance to defend themselves.  otherwise we will demoralise the organisation and discourage officers from taking initiatives or responsibility, for fear of being punished for making mistakes.10.         this same principle of responsibility and accountability also applies to ministers.  it is the prime minister�s duty to decide how each minister has performed in his portfolio.  hence when a lapse happens, i will ask the same questions of the minister � how is he involved in the matter? has he been incompetent or negligent?  most serious of all, is there a question of integrity?  if so, he has to go, even if the actual incident is minor.  i will also ask: is the minister able to put things right, or does the situation call for a new pair of hands, not encumbered by what went before, to take charge and make a fresh start?  of course the prime minister himself is accountable too, to parliament and ultimately to the electorate.11.         however, we should not encourage a culture where officials and ministers resign whenever something goes wrong on their watch, regard­less of whether or not they are actually to blame.  that would be the easy way out.  it may temporarily appease an angry public, but it will not fundamentally solve the problem.",Negative

was super meme back then liao. especially when they were punishing the security detail but then wks still manage to get performance bonus. the whole minister no blame culture but civil/public  servants must punish meme lasted a few years iirc. this also precipitated the whole minister salary debate if i’m not wrong - wads the point of paying million dollar salary to people who are not even accountable.,Positive

"cos there'll be an uproar if the announcements are for foreign workers. the dialect speaking elderly are locals, but the foreign workers will always be seen as foreign",Negative
"the allocation of dialects to be broadcasted should be made based on the demographics of the station's passengers rather than on a arbitrary quota, especially since the main purpose of this is to make stations more accessible rather than to merely let people have the chance to hear their favourite dialects. as such since chinatown is a more chinese-frequented station, it obviously will be way more effective (in terms of accessiblity) to broadcast announcements in chinese dialects rather than in other dialects since the number of people who need announcements in hokkien/cantonese will obviously outweighs those that need it in bengali or javanese. whereas in stations which are more frequented by minorities groups, they should broadcast annoucements in minority dialects rather than in chinese dialects. the point being that this should be made based on the demographical needs of each specific station regardless if it involves chinese dialects indian dialects or malay dialects, rather than be made just for representation sake and representation sake only.",Positive

"so do the demographics in other stations just have no need for accessibility? the message is quite clear right? if youre of the majority race, we will make accommodations even if you dont speak the common language. it makes it seems like a big concession that tamil and malay are used in some stations when they’re every bit the national language that mandarin is. no one asked for malay at the chinatown station but how come no other station has any other non chinese dialects>	whereas in stations which are more frequented by minorities groups, they should broadcast annoucements in minority dialects rather than in chinese dialectsif this was actually done, then there would be fewer sour grapes",Positive

"what? no, i think its obvious what i meant - its not being done because majority privilege means that the majority’s needs are served ahead of the other races. was that not clear or what lolits the fucking internet who gives a shit about dangerous or harmful connotations?",Negative
"yes, you did. your insinuation is there for all to see. and someone already answered your question in your last paragraph. racism against any race is racism. and you seem to be very clearly racist. i read your comments and questions on other people's threads here and you apparently are interested in nothing but inciting racial discord. you refuse to accept logic or reason. instead, you are focused on making something out of nothing. people who are not racist don't immediately jump to the colour of someone's skin when dialects for the elderly are being used for safety announcements. this was dishonest and disingenuous.",Positive
"because u don't have to do everything at one go? i don't see why this cant be a pilot which will lead to more annoucements in the future featuring the dialects of the different races? if you are piloting a programme i think it would make sense to start off with the most commonly used dialects to maximize effectiveness won't it? the people going all sour over this seems to forget that not everything has to be done at one go and that having cantonese/hokkien annoucements now wont mean that there cant be bengali annoucements in the future, if anything having chinese dialect annoucements now will most likely mean there will be more dialect annoucements in the future too. some people really can find a way to nitpick at everything eh.",Positive
"yes i am. sorry ah, i don't accept things as ""duh facts"". you know what they say about assuming? yeah, i'll let you finish that sentence.  now, look at page 17 of your data.  1. comparing the chinese and the indians in 2015, you see that 27.1% of the chinese spoke chinese only or others only, whereas 27.4% of the indians spoke tamil only or others only. there is a 0.3% difference between the two groups.  2. comparing the chinese and the malays in 2015, you see that 27.1% of the chinese spoke chinese only or others only, whereas 12.4% of the malays spoke malay only or others only. now, there is a significant difference between the two groups of 14.7%. so you may say that you have grounds to pursue your argument for these races. but again, i refer you to point 1 above.  3. as an expansion on point 1, even though there is a 0.3% difference between the chinese and the indians in terms of english literacy, this data applies to the entire literate resident population aged 15 years and over. there is no breakdown of data pertaining solely to the elderly (defined as 65 and above). so, you can see how your data does not actually lend much weight to your ""duh fact"". and this is why we question.",Positive
"that is why i asked you to clarify your sentence.because i am a brown person and i felt what you've stated is a sweeping statement with negative connotations. instead of shooting at you straight up, i asked you to clarify. fair isn't it?i share the same idea that we need dialects for our elderly who travel to or live around chinatown.i've worked in a nursing home before.it is difficult for us caretakers to convey messages to the elderly because of language barrier.so i support this notion.what other myopic people do not see is how it could potentially save lives and ease the operational process for the train personnel.in the long run, having dialect announcements for our elderly is efficient and cost-effective.so again, as a brown person i support this idea.",Negative
"or maybe you’ve ignored race for so long that whenever it comes up, you get defensive. and please lol, dont hide behind “i saw your other comments about race”. if there is actual harmony then one random troll on the internet wont rub you so strongly. truth is, it’s a valid question to be asking, and diatribes about racism instead of discussing the question is just cowardly",Positive

(ie why only bengali? why not hindu? why only cantonese? why not hakka? why not hainanese?) while i am of the view that any progress is good progress, there will always be naysayers and nitpickers in any idea so lets just agree to disagree here for i see no point in continuing this discussion.",Positive

"why are you digressing into the others category now? your point was that the chinese majority elderly are much less literate in english than the indian and malay elderly right? i just drew out statistics from the paper that you yourself linked to show you that that is patently false for the chinese v indian slice, and that even if the data supports your assertion for the chinese v malay slice, it is not scoped to the elderly to begin with. the others category could have 1 language or 100 for all i care, it makes no difference to to the fact that your linked paper does nothing to support your assertion.  even if, for argument's sake, we accept this data to be representative of the elderly in singapore (which, it is not - it is a data for everyone above the of 15), and we say that yes - very few (3.6%) of the tamils who comprise roughly half of all indians in singapore exclusively speak tamil, how do you know that the rest of them (96.4%) are speaking english? could they not be speaking malay instead of tamil? how about tamils who are fluent in telugu/malayalam/sanskrit? they too would be lumped into this 96.4% figure, thereby misleading you to think that they are literate in english. you are making a ton of assumptions off of this data. typical tactic by the way - when you can't be swung by facts, question the dissenting viewer's nationality.",Negative
"i mean, you’re the one who called me dishonest and disingenuous, but apparently defensive is too far. anyway, i’ve shared my thoughts here - i dont actually care about the languages tbh, and even less about the old people. the point was that people seemed baffled by why got sour grapes or whatever, so i was sharing what the likely reason was. simple, racist",Negative
"simple translation of what you said: i am chinese, and so i’m happy with the current progress because the elders in my community were served. it is unfortunate the other communities didnt get this assistance, maybe next time they will learn to be born chinese>	(ie why only bengali? why not hindu? why only cantonese? why not hakka? why not hainanese?)these are valid questions, not nitpicks lol. some communities just seem to get more help than others. some communities have sap schools that are almost entirely just for them, strange right?",Positive
"firstly, it is very disingenuous  to say that i am digressing when you are the one who brought “others” up in the first place. i can’t see how any singaporean would intepret the stats like you do, because it is a very very poor interpretation of the stats at handit is very simple, there is a sizeable non tamil speaking, non tamil minority amongst indians comprising almost 40+%, this is included among english only speaking, and malay+english, but is mostly encompassed by “others”, which can comprise as hindi+english. going by the fact thatonly  less than 10% of tamil speakers can speak tamil only, if we apply this to the others category, in this case being hindi only etc, and add to the tamil only category, it is a sizeable difference between this and the chinese only, not even adding “others” which can include only dialect speakers which form a sizeable population in one room flats in chinatown. it would be good if you could be around chinatown more as you would be more cognisant of this issue.",Positive
"actually wrong, my grandparents speak hakka, not hokkien or cantonese so they are actually not served at all :).  not all chinese are the same you know, just like not all indians are tamils or all malays are javanese/bugis. the world is not as simple as just chinese indian malay and others you know, so do try to view things outside of the simplistic lenses of skin colour next time :)",Negative
"no, it is not disingenuous at all. i brought it up only because your linked paper breaks the data down into c/m/t only, english only and others only. the focus, however, is on your premise that chinese elderly are significantly less english-literate than the indian/malay elderly. it is ironic that i am having to re-focus you to your very own premise that you brought up. i am still waiting to hear your riposte on the 0.3% difference in english literacy between the chinese and indians i brought up. oh, and the even bigger issue of how this data is irrelevant to begin with because it is not scoped to the elderly.let's break down your second assertion now and systematically go through them.1. _""there is a sizeable non-tamil speaking, non-tamil minority amongst indians comprising almost 40+%""_- wrong. you are making the same mistake i alluded to in my earlier reply. yes, 46% of indians in singapore are non-tamil. that does not mean that they do not speak tamil! an example would be a ceylonese (non-tamil) who speaks tamil. goodness! do you have chinese relatives who speak languages other than mandarin? now it is my turn to ask you whether you are singaporean or not.2. _""going by the fact that only less than 10% of tamil speakers can speak tamil only, if we apply this to the others category, in this case being hindi only""_- same mistake as above. there may be a significant number of hindi speakers who speak urdu, gujarati, marati, sindhi etc. and not english. it seems that the longer we go on, the more assumptions you make.now, for your last assumption:i go to chinatown literally every week, even more frequently than i go to little india. but that is besides the point. you could be living there day-to-day and still massacre data to this extent to support a point that frankly, you have no robust evidence for.",Positive
"lol, preaching to the choir. sorry i mis dialected you, but basically other communities dont get shit, and even when the basic is done its paraded around like progress. my mum side is canto too, but i can’t speak either canto, or any of my dad side languages (arabic, hewbrew)",Negative
"i can frankly say i am now very confused by your line of reasoning, and your insistence on the use of this 0.3% figure which is extremely disingenuous and misleading; and page 16 should really suffice for my point anyway.",Negative
"apologies accepted. you seem to have an very interesting family lineage judging from the side languages which are used. regardless i certainly hope that this move to lead to more inclusive announcements everyone, i just feel that this at its core it is a positive move which should be celebrated. but ofcos it should not stop at where it is and should instead continue be expanded on further and further from just chinese dialects to the dialects of all races too.",Positive
"let me be the one to clarify this confusion for you simply.you: this paper which looks at 15+ y.o and not just the elderly, says that in 2015, amongst indians (54% of which are tamils), just a meagre 3.6% could speak tamil only! this means that the vast majority of tamils can speak english!me: no. you have assumed that the remaining 96.7% can speak english just because 3.6% speak tamil only. wrong, wrong, wrong. they could be speaking tamil + malay, tamil + malayalam, tamil + the language of the gods.now you add oil to fire and quote page 16 (one page before page 17 from which i drew these statistics). page 16 my sweet, summer child, is even worse. page 16 shows us that the general literacy is 96.5% for the chinese and 97.3% amongst the malays and 98.3% amongst the indians. how is this compatible with your primary premise of ""the chinese elderly are much less english-literate than the indian elderly and malay elderly""?i think if there's one thing we can agree on, is that prolonging this painful discussion is not going to be productive for either of us. government just gave us a skillsfuture top-up. might want to jump on that datascience bandwagon and take up a 101 course, or really, just question all these baseless assumptions about the data presented in this irrelevant source.",Positive
"yeah thanks. to your earlier point about why i keep harping on race, i think when you’re one of the few people of a certain mixed background, the inconsistencies in how different groups are treated or given benefit of the doubt is quite jarring. the little india riots were my first taste of it - made the mistake of seeing how edmw reacted. since then, its been hard to reconcilce that that is how my countrymen view others who look different from them",Negative
"general literacy dosen't mean english literate. the reason i quote page 14 is, if you subtract the percentage of english only speakers who are chinese, from the percentage of one language speakers, you will get non english speakers who are chineseno need for digs.",Negative

"honestly there's so much that could be done for mrts that it boggles my mind.is nobody at smrt customer oriented? let's see..1. lack of consistency of aircon suggests lack of regular maintenance/servicing of the aircon units in certain trains. on that note, quite a few trains have bad smells, like wet stuff that didn't dry properly.2. the tv screen is hard to see even when up close, worse if you are far away.3. there either is absolutely no game plan, or just very bad planning in terms of customer flow (e.g. entry gantry all on the right to go to escalator down on left side, while escalator coming up is on the right, but exit gantry on the left... so naturally every day people coming in fighting with people going out)4. lack of planning ahead. it doesn't take a genius to realize that when you grow a township (e.g. tampines) by such a large margin, you may... i don't know... need more escalators? for a while it got to the point where people from the previous train are still trying to get down from the platform when the next train pulls into the station during peak hours.5. if you have no advertisers, maybe instead of shitty smrt ads you can put up public service announcements (e.g. keep left when walking, don't talk on the phone while walking, hold handrails, look after your children, etc). overall it just feels like there's very little high level direction on planning within smrt stations and a lot of ""let's hope the new lines will ease the customer flow so we don't have to do anything"".",Positive

"ya i agree. i think sg is doing a lot to improve the mrt system. all the new lines and the upgrading - i am thankful. also the timing is more consistent as compared to a few years ago when breakdowns occured like 3-5 times a day and usually during peak hours omg. but yea i agree with the customer flow design, and how sometimes escalators are labelled as “under maintainence” for over 2 months. escalator break down is not very common but when it does happen, it affects the entire flow so maybe they can design more considering interchanges will be flooded. but their game plan to improve customer flow is to... assign mrt staff to stand there and speak into their microphones and direct people during peak hours. my heart goes out to them cuz it’s probably hot and stuffy at the non ac platforms.",Negative

"to be clear, i do think that the main core issues have been addressed (the peak hour frequency which has been assisted by the pandemic now) but it just feels like nobody has ever thought about the qol improvements that could be made to improve the passenger experience. i wonder why some escalators can take up to half a year to fix. i would assume that getting skilled technicians who can fix escalators (and paying them a commensurate pay) would have been one of the big priorities for smrt, given the amount of escalators under their jurisdiction.",Negative

"> # daewoo director, project manager in mrt construction project jailed for bribing former lta director> singapore: two daewoo engineering and construction executives, who gave bribes to a land transport authority (lta) deputy group director while working on their company's first project in singapore, were jailed for eight months on tuesday (may 18).> kim young-gyu, a 52-year-old director, and ro sungyoung, a 49-year-old project manager, pleaded guilty to a charge each of conspiring to bribe henry foo yung thye with s$30,000. each man had a second charge involving another s$20,000 taken into consideration for sentencing.> advertisement> advertisement> kim and ro are the first to be sentenced in a wide-ranging corruption case where foo, who was the deputy group director of the thomson-east coast and cross-island lines, is accused of taking about s$1.24 million in bribes.> the judge noted that both men did not actively seek to cultivate foo, but said that it was ""not completely for selfless reasons"" when they eventually gave in. instead, they gave the bribes to benefit themselves and daewoo, she said.> lta awarded the main contract for the construction of the stevens mrt station to daewoo for s$441 million in april 2014. this was the first time daewoo was awarded a project in singapore.> advertisement> advertisement> kim and ro worked on the project and reported to foo for official quarterly meetings with lta.> foo, who also chaired the tender evaluation committee for the project and had powers to commit lta to additional expenditures, began asking ro for loans in mid-2018.> ro was afraid to offend the high-ranking lta officer and discussed the matter with kim, his boss. kim rejected the notion angrily at first, as he knew it was against both daewoo's policies and singapore law.> henry foo yung thye, former lta deputy group director, is accused of taking bribes and cheating colleagues. (screengrab: youtube/lta)> advertisement> however, foo kept pursuing ro for loans, until kim and ro decided they could no longer reject him. they hoped that agreeing to his loan request would put them on friendly terms with foo and facilitate the smooth progress of train station works.> kim also feared that foo might apply ""time pressure"" on daewoo if they offended him and influence lta's inspections of their work.> the pair also hoped the loan would stand them in good stead to be awarded future lta projects, especially in comparison with other contractors who had not given money to foo.> ro lent foo s$30,000 after foo sent him a text message on dec 31, 2018, saying he needed to raise a sum of money urgently for family issues.> after lending foo the money, ro began asking foo for help in return. he turned to foo in may 2019 after an lta officer inspected the train station worksite and given daewoo a negative score for infringements of safety or cleanliness.> foo said he would help by speaking to lta's group director of safety and contracts. but his intervention did not change the score, and daewoo did not clinch a project on the jurong region line they had put in a bid for.> in august 2019, foo sent ro a confidential screenshot of an assessment by the lta tender evaluation committee, after ro asked him why daewoo had failed in the first stage of an lta tendering process for the construction of tunnels at changi airport.> the corrupt practices investigation bureau caught wind of the corruption and the trio were nabbed.> prosecutors had called for eight months' jail for kim and ro, while defence lawyers asked for a high fine, or three to four weeks' jail and no more than six months' jail in the alternative.> foo is set for a pre-trial conference in june. he faces 36 charges that range from taking bribes from contractors or subcontractors to cheating his colleagues into giving him loans between 2008 and 2019.> the cases for several other co-accused are pending.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Positive

"or goh jin hian's. you can read all about it in dedicated business and finance publications, but 160th is very quiet. the whole situation is very strange. how can you be accused in civil court of defrauding banks of $212 million as the director of several companies and yet cpib has seemingly taken minimal interest in this?

"why would i want to use my fingers to type on a glass screen and interact with a bot instead of immediately clicking on something the moment its presented to me.if you don't want an application, you can make a mobile website that fulfills the same function.i don't want to manually input options for the quirky and cool bus uncle bot when i can click a button or two and get things done.",Positive
post it on r/learnpython or r/python if you are willing to show your codes to get more feedback.,Positive

you are missing what i think is a key feature in this app - push notifications.,Negative
"well designed bots have on screen buttons that function just as well as normal apps, no typing is necessary. web application is possible as well but it doesn’t introduce the “all in one” aspect. also, the experience you’re getting on a web browser is definitely not on par as a native well designed telegram bot. i agree that a bot may not be feasible for everything and can never replace apps totally, but it’s definitely a great step forward for simplicity. to each its own actually!",Positive

"even before it closed down, ten mile station was so underutilised. the dead mall and the fact that you had to wait to change to a specific train (low frequency) that went to ten mile were reasons why nobody wanted to go there. i would rather take the bus honestly if i had to. it was just a matter of time the station got shut down.",Negative
"this is ultimately the cumulative result of several factors: the line was poorly planned — the line was built due to political pressure and although it was designed to combat the high road traffic seen in bukit panjang and choa chu kang, this line was conceived after the towns were built. also, since this was done in order to relieve traffic the line was also built because it did not require manpower. next, this station had very low demand and train frequencies, one train every 20 minutes. the fact that there are better shopping centres in bp and cck and its location may also be reasons why people do not choose to go to this station. last but not least, is due to the fact that the bp lrt itself has a lot of issues due to its age, planning and equipment so the entire line had to be overhauled with equipment replaced, so removing service c (to ten mile junction) would relieve the lrt of some stress and be repurposed to test stuff with whatever is left of the station.",Negative

"this. tried it once with the wife from orchard to woodlands. i’ll give credit for the whole electric car experience as positive, but thumbs down for everything else, from the signing up, to using ezlink card to access the car, to cramped car with lack of sound damping and spoiled aircon and i was on the highway during evening peak hours.. the drive cost the same as a chauffeured grab ride in the end.",Positive

lol!,Positive
"that's unfortunate to hear! i've been using bluesg for 2 years now and my experience has been largely positive. there have been a few incidents where the aircon was dismal and the car was losing power, but overall i really enjoyed using it and it's saved me a lot of money from taking cab/grab on numerous occasions.",Positive
"bluesg charges by the minute, so it's not a good idea to use them during peak hours.",Negative
"it seems that in amsterdam, microcars started out as for the disabled. and for those able-bodied people, they now require a driving licence and register as cars etc, so more regulations. remains to be seen how feasible it is under these new rules.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9ly7jjqeb0",Positive
good to hear this! am interested in how the sums works out compared to taking a cab/grab. are you on a subscription plan? and what’s the per trip usage? maybe i’ve yet to figure out how to justify that the meter is still running if my trip involves parking in a destination without the charge point.,Positive
"i would say it depends on your primary usage! it's best used as a direct point-to-point transportation due to the meter, without any detours along the way. i'm on the premium subscription which is $18/month, but i get 45mins free (33c / min) every month as well, so in fact i'm only paying around $3 per month every month! on my savings, for example a 15min trip from cbd to my house could cost me $12, but using the bluesg meter it would only cost me $4.95! but i'd also have to walk a short distance from the charging point to my house, which i can live with given the huge savings i got. the only downside is you have to have both a car at your starting destination and a parking lot at your destination available, and i would say 40% of the time there are no cars from where i wanna depart, especially in the town area. but i've found it incredibly useful, convenient and cheap when i'm headed to my friends' houses in faraway places like punggol and jurong.if you're looking to use the bluesg to run errands at a few places for example, they currently offer 3hour ($39.90) and 5hour ($49.90) rental packages which is more value for money for the time spent! i've used these a couple of times when i know i'll be on the road for extended periods of time.",Positive
"got it, agree that in your use case it does make sense. as with most of these new tech/ services i’m glad that i do see more people using bluesg, hope the trends continues to grow for wider adoption, pushing the prices down and opening up more usage options. the 3hours and 5 hours packages is something new, sound interesting, will check it out. thanks for your sharing!",Positive
interesting... do you get caught in traffic jams with the car? do you ever have problems finding the car during peak hours?,Positive
"so far, i've been fortunate to only have been caught in a jam once in my two years, which added probably about $3 to $4?peak hour availability really depends on location. in my estate the cars are normally still available in the mornings as not many people drive to work, but after 6.30pm it'd be hard to find a car at raffles place for example. but if you don't mind a short walk / mrt ride, you could then get a car from tanjong pagar which tends to have more cars available until 10pm when people would drive home after dinner in the area.i'd suggest checking out the [station map](https://www.bluesg.com.sg/stations-map) to have a rough idea of whether the availability of cars and lots meets your usage during your intended time!",Positive

make no mistake - if there is gross negligence, if there's wilful wrongdoing, disciplinary actions will be taken,"" he said.> ""sometimes it is really a matter of retraining ... self reflect and go back and do better, and share your learning with your colleagues and i think it is a good system to ensure that we keep on improving.""> > cable faults> > mr ong also said that testing and inspection of power cables will be stepped up. the faulty cables are being investigated, he noted, adding that the results of the forensic examination are still unknown.> he added that there have been four power cable failures along the tuas west extension since 2018, and lta and smrt had earlier expressed their concerns to the supplier alstom.> > ""on other lines, they typically have a lifespan of 20, 25, 30 years so this is a bit premature to have four faults in the last few years, which i think explains why alstom is stepping forward, replacing everything,"" he said.> > giving more details on the earlier cable faults in response to a question by leader of the opposition pritam singh, mr ong said that two failures happened when the cables were first commissioned in 2018. the other two happened this year.> > 22kv cable faults in 2018 and 2020 (image: lta)> ""the reasons for the failures have not been established which is why, given what has happened, we should send them for forensic (examination) and understand the reason why. in the meantime, regardless of the reasons, cables will be replaced.""> > evacuation of train passengers> mr ong also went into the considerations behind whether to ask passengers to alight from stalled trains and walk along the tracks.> ""safety of commuters is the top priority during service recovery. that is why detraining commuters is always a last resort because to have commuters walking along the track poses risk, especially for those who are elderly or handicapped, and so it needs to be very carefully carried out,"" he said.> replying to supplementary questions by ms pereira and mr saktiandi, mr ong explained that typically, a decision should be made as to whether to ""detrain"" passengers in a disruption, but there are many factors to consider.> ""and then, like that night, there was inclement weather and there was lightning risk. once there's lightning risk, you stop - never put passengers' lives in danger. so you're balancing between these two ... in this case, there was some hope that they could repower, but the repower went wrong.""> he also said that evacuation on the circle line was faster than on the older mrt lines as it has a side platform where commuters can walk and wheelchairs can be used.> typically on the nsewl, the elderly, the wheelchair-bound and those with mobility issues have to remain on a stalled train until more manpower, including singapore civil defence force (scdf) officers, arrive.> ""if need be, we use stretchers to carry such passengers to the nearest station. the stations are also equipped with battery-powered motorised trolleys,"" he said.> he added that the passengers have to walk beside a high voltage third rail, and they might trip.> ""you got to make sure you disable it -

"i'm gonna put my own personal opinion which runs contrary to most in the thread in that i think that the teenage girl should have given the seat (but i do agree that the elderly lady was likely picking on someone young to hopefully get a seat)personally, if a person asks me for a seat on the mrt or bus i'd usually give it to them because i'd give them the benefit of the doubt that they think they need the seat more than i do. and that definition of  'seat necessity & priority' to me is that the seat should go to the person whose discomfort & pain is most or more alleviated by sitting. by sheer statistics and my own anecdotal experience, most elderly suffer from some sort of limb/leg/hip/back problem which makes them a lot more comfortable sitting than standing; i don't have that problem so i think they deserve the seat more than me. parents with young children are really fucking tired from trying to corral/entertain/quiet their kids, so if they ask for a seat i'd also give it to them because they get more comfort (and peace of mind) than i do by sitting. that being said, i won't judge people if they don't give a seat\* (unusual circumstances withstanding) because maybe they're tired after a long day of work, maybe they have comorbidity that is relatively invisible, etc etc. all i can control are my own expectations & beliefs, and to that extent i think seats should be given to those who ask; their circumstances might be worse than mine and i don't lose a lot by giving up a seat.",Negative
"unpopular opinion maybe but i’m inclined to think that it’s weird or sad, maybe, that the teenager’s response was to note that she was not sitting on a reserved seat and hence should not have to give up her seat. to be fair she does have a right to not give the seat up. it’s her prerogative and we have no idea whether she’s just tired after a long day or what. but i find issue with her idea that only those sitting on a reserved seat should give up her seat. i thought it’s common courtesy that people would or should give up their seat to those who need it, regardless of what colour the seat is. she could’ve said she she’s tired or bla-bla-bla but she implied that sitting on a non-reserved seat grants her immunity from giving up her seat?? that’s very weird imo????it’s hard to judge without actually being there and i would steer away from saying who’s entitled or rude etc. idk that’s just me lah! agree to disagree.",Negative

it’s all about the network. top agents have a solid network of high net-worth individuals who trusts them and bring them referrals (other high net worth people as birds of a feather flock together).it is unlikely that insurance agents close big deals by cold calling or fishing at the mrt station. insurance agents are sold the dream of making it big mdrt etc and work very hard for their dreams. they may work hard (mrt sales) but it’s the ones that work smart (with strong networking skills) that make the cut. sometimes luck is a factor as well,Negative
"those at the mrt stations and doing cold calls are probably just starting out.  after a few years, an agent who has serviced existing clients well will get referrals.top agents have access to high net-worth individuals, either because they move in the same circles or have friends who do.  those with a high eq will have cultivated a pool of close friends during school and uni days.  after graduation, these friends become their starting network.  as everyone progress in their careers, the network becomes bigger with increasing net worth.  access is one thing, the agent must be able to deliver value to the clients.  there are always other agents trying to poach the clients.",Positive
"my grandfather was one of the top insurance agents. that's because he doesn't turn away small clients unlike what many of his colleagues do. stuff like canteen stalls, hawker centres, he won't turn them away. although he does not earn as much commission from each policy they sign, he has enough networking and clients that it compensates adequately and he still makes a very respectable income back then.",Positive

"> # mto report called for man who stopped mrt train after phone supposedly fell onto tracks> singapore — a mandatory treatment order report was called for a man who pulled the emergency stop at buona vista mrt station after claiming to have dropped his handphone onto the train tracks. > clement joshua tan teck kim was suffering from schizophrenia, which might have contributed to the commission of his offence, the state courts heard on friday (23 april). > tan pleaded guilty to one count each of causing public annoyance to the public, using criminal force on an smrt staff member, and of assaulting a security officer who tried to stop him from leaving. > on 29 february last year, at around 11am, tan sought assistance from control station after stating that he had dropped his phone onto the train tracks as he was boarding the train. the station manager said that he could only retrieve his phone the following day as this did not constitute an emergency worth disrupting train service for. > however, tan insisted on retrieving his phone and wanted to press the emergency stop plunger. the station manager called the police for assistance. > after the police arrived, tan calmed down and left the mrt station. > at around 3.15pm, he returned to the mrt station to retrieve his phone. he claimed that he needed the phone urgently as his baby had developed a fever and he needed to speak to his girlfriend to bring his baby for treatment. > he was told once again that his reason was not an emergency and train service could not be disrupted to retrieve his phone. > tan then went to the station platform to press the stop plunger. an smrt assistant manager attempted to stop him, but tan pushed the assistant manager before pressing the emergency plunger, causing the mrt train to stop. > a delay of two minutes was caused to commuters in the mrt train.> an argument later broke out between tan and several other staff members who followed him. a security officer on duty witnessed the commotion and saw tan acting in an aggressive and abusive manner. when tan attempted to leave, the security officer tried to stop him by grabbing his shirt but tan punched him on the face. > at about 4pm that day, smrt lodged a police report over the incident. > according to tan's institute of mental health report, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. he was last seen on 4 may last year and had residual hallucination but was otherwise calm and coherent. it was not clear whether his mental condition had a contributory link to his offence. > tan will return to court on 21 may. > stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t.me/yahoosingapore> more stories:> 7 months' jail for man who threatened judge over 377a suits> singaporean actor shane pow charged for drink driving> tracetogether to be compulsory at many places from 1 june---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Positive
