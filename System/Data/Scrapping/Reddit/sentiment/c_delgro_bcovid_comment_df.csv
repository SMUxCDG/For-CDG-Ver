"yup. just go to carousell. some buy at retail then jack up a few bucks. i don’t mind paying a little more for discontinued items but for new releases? smh. these days as far as diecast collecting goes, i go for vintage tomica models and late 1960s to 1980s issues of any maker from 1/24 to h0 scale to keep things interesting.

can’t wait to buy it! is it with all the rest of the tomicas at the back of top level?,Positive

yeap correct. you will see like a tomica pop-up display at the isetan entrance on level 3 of nex.,Neutral

comfort delgro wants to collect unpaid fair from passenger.,Positive
"nobody can say for sure what happened inside the cab unless there was an inward facing camera. maybe to the passenger, the driver looked as if he was acting 'crazy' when he passed out. the least he could do if he noticed something happening to the driver was to prevent the vehicle from moving any further? well but what do i know, i'm just an armchair critic.",Positive
"think since there's so many people who said the passenger should have done something: yeah, no, i don't blame the passenger in the slightest. i'd be freaked out too if i noticed my driver behaving erratically and my first thought would honestly to get myself and whoever's with me out of there asap. being a hero is tough, and i'm not one for that.",Positive

so the passenger didn’t get the driver any help?,Neutral
"and he does that with full knowledge that his car would also get hit. i think that’s what is most admirable, willing to sacrifice his car for the sake of others’",Positive
that’s not fare,Neutral
"i assume the passenger either panicked, or was unaware that the handle between the front seats, usually called the parking brake, is also referred to as the emergency brake.i wouldn't step out of a moving car, let alone into motorway traffic.",Negative
is it because he is,Neutral

fare enough,Neutral
"the taxi seems to be a newer version (hyundai i40), likely to be automatic transmission. it wouldnt have a handbrake down the middle, likely to have a footbrake instead. besides, it wont be very safe to engage the handbrake at those speeds (no abs, you could slide the car).honestly when the taxi started swerving he could have alerted the driver? or told the driver to just stop driving to seek help.",Positive
the taxi was moving pretty slowly when he got out though. i think you will step out of a slow moving car if the car has been swerving left and right and hitting the center barrier.,Positive
the driver blacked out so it's not like he could have just told him to stop driving.,Neutral
i think we think differently.  the first thing i would do is try to take control of the situation. what happens if the semi-conscious driver accelerates just as i step out?  ,Positive
this is like betting against your best friend.,Positive
">""upon completion of the transaction, lion city rentals will be able to benefit from comfortdelgro's world-class fleet management and operations, which will be in the interest of drivers and consumers alike,"" said comfortdelgro.what the fuck are you talking about?",Positive
"if you can't beat them, buy them out?",Neutral
"comfort merely acquired part of the rental car business, which uber had to set up specifically for uber drivers to overcome the high prices here. thats a definite win for uber imho, they get a boatload of cash and they amazingly found someone to actually take partial ownership of their rental fleet and bear part of the risk of low demand and obselecence. arguably the most troublesome part of their ops in singapore.if this wasnt enough all the uber drivers renting the car from there still use the uber app, plus comfort is still nice enough to drive even more traffic to them in the form of cab drivers. what a deal.controlling the rental car business with 51% isnt even leverage, its just cars- uber can set it up all over again should it need to without comfort, and their users will have to jump over. in fact that leaves comfort with a shit load of empty vehicles which it then has to offload or idle (sounds familar?), which means uber has more command over the fleet in reality.",Positive
ownself,Neutral
"> comfortdelgro added that taxi drivers will also be able to receive ride requests on the uber driver app, thereby increasing their potential earnings and allowing customers the option of booking a comfortdelgro taxi through the uber app.took them sooo long. the comfortdelgro app is actually not bad",Positive

how does this impact taxi drivers and commuters?,Neutral
"uber is bleeding money every day. just let them fizzle out of cash, sooner or later they go bust. this is a dangerous company which lost customer data and kept quiet about it. cdg business model is renting out taxis, uber business model is to lose money until self-driving cars are invented",Negative
ownself praise ownself,Neutral
"fyi, comfortdelgro's taxi business only accounts for 30% of it's revenue. it also owns vicom and other maintenance facilities. did i mention they also own sbs transit? the comfort-uber partnership talks have been going on since january. grab has already partnered with the rest of the other taxi companies and this will help level the playing field. hope you are enlightened and don't jump too quickly to conclusions:)",Positive
"pretty sure there are clauses in the agreement that would prevent them from doing that, otherwise the lawyers at comfort should get fired. this is comfort buying into uber so their fleet doesn't get obsolete from the huge demand in door-to-door chauffeur services that people expect now. why wait and flag for a cab when you can just grab/uber?",Positive

u 2 should gay marry each other,Negative
"i take uber to avoid taxi and their service, back off pal.",Neutral
"thats true, but ill be surprised if that were the case. if there were clauses that uber has to use/ promote lion city rentals solely, it would mean that comfort has effective control over all prices charged to car renters, and can raise it at will, hurting uber. this also creates a conflict of interest since they also rent out taxis. unless of course, the agreement suggests that uber has price control for it to make adjustments to compete with grab, in which case having 51% of a rental car business is pretty useless.",Positive
ownself,Neutral
"it's win win for comfort and uber, lose lose for consumers and drivers. basically they agree to stop competing. comfort takes over the vehicles and assets, uber will send its drivers to rent from comfort, so taxi and car rentals will go up since less competition from each other. on the consumer end, same thing, instead of engaging in price war, they can put their heads together and happily increase fares.",Positive
private hire,Neutral
"it does matter, it's my money and i give my business to whomever i want to give it to. why're you so riled up by this? are you a cabbie?",Neutral
"i do think that this agreement is so that comfort will lever the uber app towards their drivers, and fight the market share that grab has been grabbing (pun intended)  the last year or so. uber were the first movers, but they have fallen behind grab, as well as comfort who has been hit hard with the emerging chauffeur market.",Negative
"this all says one thing - consumers are price sensitive and will switch to other operators or even modes of transport if and when the price is right. there is little brand loyalty - people prefer cold hard cash back rather than exchanging points for a $5 breadtalk voucher. incidentally, it is difficult to spend exactly $5 at breadtalk.",Negative
no surprise because grab is ass ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Neutral
comfort should thank uber for this...,Neutral
hopefully go\-jek comes quickly. this grab getting arrogant,Neutral
"for me it's very simple. i'm not bothered by the grab ui, any haven't really experienced bad drivers. but i draw the line when the app can't find me a car after 2 attempts. i wasn't even an uber user before it went down, i was an occasional grab taxi user and was happy with it up till a few months ago. dunno what changed.",Negative
because uber ded grab is monopolising,Neutral
what choice do the people really have?,Positive
"consumers have been conditioned by phv to get a ride on demand. now that grab don't subsidise rides anymore, the winner here can only be comfort. i only saw the eventual decline of grab with uber's exit, but i have to say i failed to think about how comfort could have gained from it.",Negative

shocked that the taxi driver could even run a scam like this in the first place. comfort better find a way to prevent dishonest drivers from tampering with the fares like this guy before everyone turns to private hire services like grab. :/,Negative
taxi driver deserves it.,Neutral
i know kl cab drivers tamper with the meters but first time reading about a local cabbie doing it,Positive
orbie good,Positive
what’s a location surcharge?,Neutral
i wonder if the ex-cabbie can be charged with any criminal offence for falsely charging passengers.,Negative
"so... if this incident wasn't on social media, would it have become part of ""history of overcharging"" then? this specific incident was allowed to happen because the overcharging problem wasn't solved. first there's the surcharge problem and then the meter was prolly rigged.",Positive
taxi driver probably saw that they were not singaporean hence he thought he could get away.  most cabbies in singapore are quite honest imho,Positive
its actually easy to programme a software to detect anomalies like this. ntuc already runs diagnostics to work out drivers work time and trips etc.  i wonder how many tourists and other vulnerable people have been taken for a ride.,Positive
not really tampering but hitting a button that allows him to add surcharge,Negative
"usually pick up/drop off at changi, sentosa, cbd etc.",Negative
"with grab you know you'll be paying a exorbitant price before booking so you can choose alternatives. with metered taxies there's always a level of uncertainty if you don't ride that route often.a couple years back another crooked driver charged my $3 "" location surcharge"" for a trip from plaza singapura - cbd (no erp cause it was a sunday). when i called up cdg they sent me a $5 taxi voucher in the mail and the driver called me to personally apologize a few hrs later.",Negative
demand and supply. you can choose not to take it. i don’t see anything wrong with it.,Negative
today in bugis to balestier it was $19 - thats like a 10 minute trip! on comfort it was $13 flat.,Negative
i do agree that most cabbies here are thankfully honest. it was very unscrupulous of this taxi driver to scam what i’m assuming was a domestic worker who doesn’t even make that much money in the first place. $70.25 is a huge fraction of their monthly salary (which the employer may or may not have helped to pay).,Positive

"wasn't there the time when before uber/grab, traditional taxies tend to pull the disappearing act at certain times of the day, which uber/grab solved with the floating price mechanism?whenever theres no competition consumers will always be hurt in someway.",Positive
"recently, there have been several times when comfortdelgro is half the price of graba lot of my friends are boycotting grab now, its just too expensive",Negative
"i will choose whoever is cheaper. the end result is the same which is me getting to my destination. won't boycott grab if its cheaper on that day versus comfort but for the past few weeks, every single time  i've checked, comfort has been the cheaper option",Negative
"seems that many people in this thread are *incredibly* short-sighted, almost close to being blind, if they want grab to go away.do we want to go back to not being able to hail a cab at 5pm because taxi drivers circling around, waiting for peak hour charge? oh and the app? it's the same exact thing as grab, drivers get to choose to pick up or not. how about the taxi driver rolling down the window to ask everyone where they are going? picking passengers? how about that?the beauty of surge pricing is that it encourages most people (that don't really **need** a ride anyways) to take other forms of transport instead of grab, while those that **needs** it the most will pay a much higher price for it.you've seen this happen first hand with grab vs uber. now you want taxis back and grab gone? i don't know what else to say other than you've not learnt your lesson. competition is good for consumers. embrace it. also stop whining about the 100000 e-payment standards, it's the same logic. more competition is good. please get this into your thick skulls.",Positive
"hmm, that's when grab started to suck. what a coincidence...",Neutral
just much cheaper,Positive
"i feel that normal taxis should be cheaper for short duration rides, plus you won’t need to waste your time waiting for your grab to arrive. sometimes i’ll just hop in to 1 of the taxis that’s waiting in line at the taxi stand just to save my time.",Positive
all thanks to uber,Positive
"let's kick grab out and go back to regular taxis, please.",Neutral
singaporeans cannot have good things. the grass is always greener on the other side to them.,Positive
what's updog?,Neutral
"good, glad. i see they're offering more promo codes as well these days.",Positive
i have to agree no choice nowadays it's more expensive and harder to get drivers. sometime it's faster for me to grab a cab than to grab,Positive
"encountered the same, travelling from amk to yishun. grab was quoting me $28!!?? at price surge. used comfortdelgro app, $12 flat rate.",Negative
or you know.. report taxis who refuse to pick you up to lta and they'll get $300 fine. happened last month,Positive
"is anything being done with this ""competition"" though?even with comfort taking more market share, grab still seems to be dicking around with other things and seem disinterested in improving their taxi business. eventually comfort will get comfortable and relax their aggressive discounts.until grab retaliates, this ""competition"" is pretty much non-existent. the only real competition was when uber was around and comfort had to wake up.with the more professional uber gone, it's like watching two clowns slug it out.",Positive
"we don't want grab to go away, we want uber to come back. it's incredible that they were allowed to merge.",Positive
"haha. i mean sometimes people forget its past. i'm just happy that grab is here and comfort is challenging itself. all of this started when uber and grab came to singapore. with other riding platforms coming to sg, it would be interesting to see what's going to happen.",Positive
>drivers get to choose to pick up or nothis is the thing i hate the most and the thing i miss most about uber.,Positive
"> the beauty of surge pricing is that it encourages most people (that don't really need a ride anyways) to take other forms of transport instead of grab, while those that needs it the most will pay a much higher price for it.it makes it possible for people with money to travel regardless and fucks it up for those that want a cab but can't afford it. don't get me wrong - i'm one of the tosspots that will book a cab regardless of the price if i need to go somewhere, so it suits me down to the ground - but it's not all sunshine and roses.i don't want to lose apps for booking - but i suspect the genie is out of the bottle on that one. i wish we had uber still as i was their most loyal supporter since they had bentleys on the road - but we don't. grab is crap and i don't want to give them any money whatsoever.",Negative
what do you think will happen if there were only taxis without grab or uber? do you think that taxi companies wouldn't do what grab did when uber exited?,Neutral
no thx.,Neutral
"hell no. back to the days where taxi drivers ignore you because all conveniently 'change shift' at certain hours (yes i know you can book taxis too but without grab we'd have way less options), incessantly asking for preferred route while not using gps (yes i know they are trying to cover backside. but it's still annoying af especially when i already told them i just want the fastest way), ranting about gahmen and foreigners (i know not every taxi driver does this but personally i've met way more ranty taxi uncles than phv drivers).... no thanks. grab sucks now but they still have a place in the market. and grab rewards > comfort points",Positive
$28 wow,Positive
"the thing is if uber comes back, one if them will definitely pull out or come to an agreement to increase the pricing or pay the drivers lesser. it just isn't sustainable for both companies since they are making a loss / aren't earning due to the phv competition.",Negative
i can't help but wonder if this nostalgia for uber is being processed through rose-tinted glasses. i remember loads of riders and drivers raging about uber on the various phv fb groups when it was still around. now uber is being painted as some kind of saint.,Positive
"just curious, what's your issue with grab? i'm assuming you're a rider. virtually all the rage against grab i've seen has been from drivers who claim that grab shits on its drivers in favour of riders. personally i used to prefer uber because i had an unpleasant run-in with grab ceo anthony tan (ya i'm petty af) but at the end of the day convenience and saving money was more important than my pride and i started using grab again. no real issues for me so far except a couple of horrible drivers... but by and large it's a pain-free experience.",Positive
i feel like taxis are more knowledgeable and less scummy about this because they've been around longer and don't really resort to such radical changes. they're more stable and constant and wouldn't pull any fast moves. when was the last time comfort did something fancy?all they do is just _be there_ .,Positive
"i mean, the way i look at it, you either have asshole comfort, or asshole comfort _and_ grab.for me, i just don't take taxis often. the biggest power consumers have against companies is taking your money elsewhere. i know singapore's public transport is iffy, but at least you're not enabling these scummy taxi companies.",Negative
"it's all relative. uber > grab so people will miss it, even if they hated uber at one point or another (i personally stopped using uber for about 6 months once as they'd fucked me off about something or other).",Negative
"nah, uber has always been better than grab for me, from the app experience to how the handle support. but that's not the point, we want more competition, not less.",Positive
i don’t like the app and i hate the fact it tells drivers where i’m going. one major benefit of uber was the fact the driver either accepted the fare or not - they didn’t know where they were driving. this benefitted us greatly in singapore where taxi uncles pick and choose their fares - but grab allows their drivers to do this. a taxi service is useless unless they drive me where i want to go.,Negative
"you have more faith than me. companies want profit, if they didn't have to put in more to get the profits, they won't. they start giving out better service and promo codes because they want to stay in the game. if grab goes away, so do the promo codes. the service will get strained by higher volume and it will be the same all over again. that's my view anyway.",Positive
"they were scummy, which was why they were affected by uber/grab. now the tables are turned we will see what they are doing.",Neutral
"i find their effectively round-the-clock peak period surcharge pretty scummy. or how the meter ticks in 20 second chunks (iirc, correct me if i'm wrong), so if a taxi stops for like 5 seconds, it will still tick once, and 25 seconds will tick twice.remember, taxis were the original villains that we boycotted when ride hailing platforms came about, now we're going back to them?",Positive
"> i feel like taxis are more knowledgeable and less scummytaxi uncles are some of the least knowledgeable people on the roads of singapore. on average their driving is awful, their customer care is awful, and they couldn't give a fuck about their customers as they want to pick and choose which jobs they take. a lot of them also try and drive the longest route hoping that their passenger doesn't know better. uber solved this by placing a rating system - so when your uber uncle shows up and his cab stinks of smoke and farts, or his driving is like someone playing a bad computer game where the aim is to score points by repetitively accelerating/decelerating and wobbling the wheel then you can hand out a shit review and he won't get any more jobs. can't do that with the normal taxis.",Positive
"fair enough. unfortunately i have to take either taxis or phvs regularly, and often to ulu out-of-the-way places for work. and sometimes i need to get to those places pronto. and i don't own a car. i remember the bad old days when i had to head down to somewhere like tuas, and taxi drivers would suddenly have somewhere urgent to go upon learning of my destination. more competition is always good for consumers. those dinosaurs at comfort made a decent a booking app probably in large part due to the disruption by phv companies.",Positive
"i agree that the codes will go away, but codes are a privilege, not a staple. if you want to take a taxi, it is going to be expensive regardless. want low prices? try the mrt.and, with no codes, the service will not get strained, because people will go back to take public transport, like how it has always been.very appalling that people can view taxis as a permanent part of their life that they cannot shake. we've lived so long without all these ride hailing nonsense, but somehow they've twisted our arms and made us rely on them. soon as we stop relying on them, they will lose their power and subsequently their big profit margins.sure, we will have lesser convenience, but again, it was a privilege from the very start, not a staple.",Positive
"i agree, the initial competiton was fantastic.in recent times, though, change has slowed, uber is gone, grab became complacent, comfort is now being aggressive just to get to the summit. once they get there, who knows what they'll do next?",Positive
"i guess the question is that we just need better competitors. grab isn't going to keep comfort on their heels for long. given enough time, grab's decine will get worse and comfort will reign again.",Positive
"competition is good, but it's hard to withold competition in small markets in singapore. see, uber absconded. you can't have big companies in singapore, sadly, because the market is just absolutely tiny when you compare it to other cities abroad. especially when you're talking about bespoke services and on top of that you have to consider how cheapo we are. so when you take your abyssmal profit margin, less discounts offered, it's just not worth investing here.",Positive
"i didn't say anything about taxi being the main mode of transport. there will be situations where you don't mind paying for a taxi, or you have to take a taxi. right now those demands are be split between grab and taxis. if grabs goes away, the taxi companies will take all the customers. as for the codes, they'll be around for a long time if there were competition. privilege or not, competition will always result in better and fairer pricing. we don't want a comcast situation, where they can do whatever the fuck they want and you have to suck it up and pay exorbitant prices. of course we should all plan our time better and avoid taking a cab. cabs are a luxury. but if prices can reach the sweet spot where it's low enough for commuters and companies are still turning a profit. why not?",Positive
"yes, i agree that some people have reasons for taxis, but a lot of people are just taking it for the hell of it. we will not have a comcast situation, because gahmen will handhold us. and a comcast-esque company will have little to profit from cheating such a small market.competition is hard to obtain in singapore. you've got a tiny market, divvied up two ways, and then even further trivialised by discounts you have to give. with such a bespoke service, it's kind of difficult to turn a healthy profit margin worth your efforts, isn't it? keep in mind these companies are big ones. like uber. they are looking at the big numbers, not the small ones. prices cannot hit the sweet spot hence. if we have more people, than the discounts will be worth it if overall the company gets a big profit, but it's just not gonna work.",Positive
"hence i said you have more faith in them then me. i don't know if the government will step in and prevent a comcast situation. if it isn't worth it for big companies to invest into our market, it gives the chance for smaller companies to grow. the market will balance itself if the rules are fair and there is a demand. before uber and grab came in and changed the market, i couldn't think of a way to improve the taxi asshole situation. yet someone did it and our lives are improved. i hope grab doesn't exit our market. i hope they innovate and change constantly. or maybe a new company rise from the ashes of uber.",Positive
"the government will. if they don't, be hella surprised. (or maybe temasek holdings has a hand in the supposrd comcast's pants)smaller companies like what? ryde was a small company. look how it fared. small companies can't pull of the technological challenge of running a digital ride hailing platform. you need a lot of capital to start, or be the first one there. so, i guess we have to wait for some genius to find an innovative and groundbreaking way to hail rides.i also hope grab innovates, but their announcements are really silly. their new grab and go thing? what? when are they going to do something about their first line of business? if they continue dicking around, they'll stop being a threatening competition and comfort will go back to their old ways.",Positive
"i agree with the concept of surge pricing when implemented correctly, but knowing how greedy taxi companies are, they're gonna screw this up so badly. while the details are scarce now, one wonders how will cab firms accurately display surge pricing for consumers over phone booking? at least for uber/grab/ taxis under grab booking, consumers can view for themselves the prices and decide if the surge pricing is worth it. phone booking offers none of that already limited transparency. furthermore good luck trying to explain to phone booking consumers the concept of surge pricing. these people are more likely to be elderly/hesitant of uber and grab, and could be put off entirely from taxi booking. hilariously enough, this might even push them over to uber and grab. don't even get me started over unscrupulous taxi drivers who might seize this opportunity over the confusion to force down 'surge pricing' for road side pick ups. which we know is going to happen. ugh.",Positive

"our tax is lower, because it ""buys"" much less for us. public housing in most countries is not priced according to an inflated ""market price"" under the direct, plausibly deniable control of the government. most advanced countries offer free or very low-cost education for the children of their citizens; many extend that to the children of all lawful residents within the country. similarly, ""can afford to die; can't afford to get sick"" is a phrase i have heard very often here, but is uniquely singaporean™ in my experience (lived in or extended visits in dozens of countries on five continents thus far). of course we have some of the finest medical care in the world available here, if you're able to pay prices that would bankrupt an ordinary singaporean family within days, plural if they're reasonably well-off. i broke my foot about 15 years ago, in a major asean country not nearly as paper-rich as singapore; the only reason i paid ~s$450 for two surgeries and six months of rehab care was because i wasn't a citizen. had i been, it would have cost me a grand total of $0 above the taxes that i and every other resident were paying.we pay taxes; they're just not *branded as* taxes. we have s&cc, erp, coe, cpf, and whatever else is buried in the fine print of the contracts we ""voluntarily"" sign because doing so is functionally compulsory for all who live here. we pay $300k+ for a $40k car, and $400k plus many extra thousands to ""reimburse"" *ourselves* for interest *lost* when using our own cpf money to rent an hdb chicken coop. (remember, if you don't hold transferable, convertible title, you hold a lease.)i don't mind paying for what i get, but there's a word for those who ensure that people rarely if ever get what they think they're paying for, and a far less complimentary word for those who coerce their marks into believing that such ponzi schemes actually benefit them.",Positive
