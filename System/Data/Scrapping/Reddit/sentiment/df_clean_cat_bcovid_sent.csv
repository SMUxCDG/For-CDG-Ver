"good detailed summary, well done. i think what many are outraged and upset about is that it's a very rare case of misjudgment in our nation that is well known for its fair judicial system. what i'm curious to examine is what compelled the judge to make such a verdict? was she really that swayed by the prospects of a bright future and future reform that she chose to ignore the facts of the case (premeditated intent, repeat offence)? it's been widely said that judges in spite of having their own liberty and opinion, tend to follow case precedence when making decisions. like you said, om cases are common yet i'm very keen to find out if there was even a precedent for such a lenient slap on the wrist despite the very clear gravity of the facts weighing against the accused. if there was no such precedent, its doubly curious as to why such a controversial verdict was delivered from an esteemed, learned and honourable judge. to err is human, and everyone of every standing makes mistakes. yet while we should not cast aspersions on the integrity of the judges (it is not their remit to deliver populist verdicts), this is not a simple case of arithmetic error. it is a verdict borne out of carefully weighing two differing arguments, mulled over and consulted by the precedent weight of every om case that has ever come before. the resulting judgment then destabilizes the hitherto impeccable faith in our legal system. but this is a good thing. it provokes conversation, and may yet push our laws to be modified for the better.",['taenerysdargaryen'],28/09/2019,45,taxi,Positive

"expat here, and i agree with your sentiment here. i find i am bleeding money in sg at a rapid rate, more so than where i came from - melbourne - which isn't exactly cheap either. but i am starting to work out there's two singapore's. there's the ""cheap"" singapore where life isn't actually that great (comparatively to where i am from) - the quality of life is better back in australia i reckon for lower/middle income earners. then there's the expensive sg, which is incredibly convenient - life is better than australia in this singapore - but also very draining on the wallet. there's a big difference between the two. in australia at least, the gap between the blue collar and white collar is no where as big as it is here. you can still have a pretty decent way of life if you're a lower (not too low of course) income earner. one noticeable difference here, especially for us expats, is the heat. the heat i find forces you to do things indoors constantly, and most indoor places are basically shopping malls, which are designed to drain your wallet. back home there's way more outdoors things you can do with the family, that are free, far away from shopping malls, and vastly more comfortable... and owning a car is much cheaper so you can get to these things cheaper and easier. example: australia - 5 minutes walk to the park where you can play for a couple of hours - free. here, if i want to take my kid to an indoor playground it's $70 when you include taxis, entry fees, etc.",['DaveDashFTW'],26/02/2017,33,taxi,Positive

"singapore - taxi operator comfort delgro has apologised after one of its drivers fainted while driving on the east coast parkway (ecp), colliding with the centre divider and causing his passenger to alight in the middle of the expressway. dashcam footage of the incident, taken around 1.10pm on friday (march 8) shows a comfort taxi swerving in and out of the rightmost lane on the benjamin sheares bridge. the cab is seen colliding with the centre divider of the bridge, appearing to leave a dent in the barrier, before swerving across another two lanes. other road users are seen slowing down or moving out of the way to avoid the taxi. as it slows down, its left passenger door opens and a man steps out. he closes the door and quickly moves to the side of the road. a silver car drives into the path of the cab, seemingly in an attempt to block it, but the taxi manoeuvers around it and drives off. the taxi's passenger is soon picked up by another car. ""i don't understand,"" says the passenger of the car recording the footage, before the video ends. many netizens also expressed confusion as to what had caused the taxi driver and passenger to act the way they had. on sunday, comfort delgro's group chief corporate communications officer, ms tammy tan, told the straits times that the cabby in the video had ""blacked out momentarily"". she said that when the driver regained consciousness, he realised that his passenger had disembarked. ""he wanted to get off the expressway to seek medical help and continued driving slowly until he was out of the expressway and at the rochor road exit gantry,"" she said. the driver then proceeded to call for assistance, she said. he is currently warded at a hospital for observation. ms tan added that comfort would like to reach out to the passenger who was on board the taxi to find out about his well-being, and that the company has been unable to contact him thus far as he had hailed the taxi on the street. ""we would like to apologise to him and all affected motorists for this incident,"" she said. the police confirmed that a report had been lodged, and are investigating the incident.",['theNEWgoodgoat'],10/03/2019,32,taxi,Positive

"singapore - a cabby, who was unaware that he had a tumour in his liver, was driving his vehicle along queensway on march 22 when the tumour suddenly ruptured, causing him to black out. mr how yuen fah's taxi [continued travelling towards jalan bukit merah before hitting at least three pedestrians](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/taxi-driver-crashes-into-pedestrians-at-alexandra-road-junction-killing-elderly-woman) who were crossing the road at a traffic light which was then showing the green man signal. one of them, madam tng yew huay, 66, was taken to the national university hospital (nuh) where she died of a head injury at around 9.20pm that day. the other pedestrians survived. following an inquiry on wednesday (sept 18), state coroner kamala ponnampalam found her death to be ""an unfortunate traffic misadventure"". she said mr how, 72, was also taken to nuh and a scan showed the ruptured tumour. he went through surgery and further medical investigations revealed that he had hepatocellular carcinoma, a cancer of the liver. the state coroner added: ""the doctor who treated him clarified that the tumour rupture caused severe bleeding into the involved party's abdomen and a loss of blood flow to his brain. ""the doctor also clarified that this caused the transient period of loss of consciousness. based on the evidence uncovered, there is no basis to suspect foul play."" mr how started driving his taxi at around 6.30pm on march 22. he did not feel tired or sick at the time and was fully rested before he began his shift. he later picked up three passengers at a bishan road taxi stand and was driving past lornie road when he felt a sharp pain in his right abdomen that subsequently went away. while travelling along commonwealth avenue west towards queensway, he felt the pain in his right abdomen again. he also felt pain in his neck, started breaking out in a cold sweat and his vision became blurred. he applied medicated oil to his forehead and nose. he was driving along queensway before the junction of jalan bukit merah when he came to a stop as the traffic lights had turned red. state coroner kamala said the cabby recalled signalling right before he fell unconscious. she added: ""when he regained consciousness, he heard the front seat passenger... shouting at him."" the court heard that mr how felt pain to the right side of his stomach. he subsequently realised that his taxi's windscreen was cracked, that his vehicle was already at the junction of alexandra road, and he was unaware that a collision had occurred. he and madam tng were taken to nuh where she died about two hours later.",['Audacity234'],20/09/2019,16,taxi,Positive

pros about grab to me is that you can see the price that you’re going to pay. so you don’t have to worry about the driver cheating you or if there’s a traffic jam. also they can pick you up at your carpark or places where there isnt a lot of taxis. don’t have to go to the main road to find one. i don’t really see any cons of using grab except for them surge prices. maybe kidnapping but even taxi drivers can do that. cons about taxi is that a lot of them are choosy. sometimes i hail a taxi & they just ignore. & also they will ask you where you wanna go to see whether they are willing to drive or not. one time i couldn’t get a grab & hailed for a taxi instead. it was the morning peak period & he dropped me like 7 blocks away from my house just so he can go to his next booking without going through the roads where there’s jam.,['boysachok'],31/03/2019,16,taxi,Positive

"lots of reasons, and combinations of reasons. i'll speak specifically to the usa since i was raised here and this guy is from here. 1.) most places have strict laws about cabbies refusing rides to passengers. the law is on the side of the passenger here almost all the time. that happened during the civil rights era, when cabbies wouldn't give rides to black people. people feel entitled to a ride no matter what the cabbies disposition is toward them, and the law supports that. this guy was denied a ride for a bs reason, really, even if it was technically illegal it's such a minor infraction so as to be completely irrelevant in most countries. i've hailed taxis in the middle of a high-speed highway in nyc, in the middle of the night when there was no traffic. illegal, but who cares. now if i specifically found myself in this situation in singapore (or anywhere) i would find an alternative and forget about it, but this guy is on a crusade against all of singapore's unjust and cruel laws, based on his post history. this isn't common among the general populace, but in the extreme right libertarian american is a righteous indignation against all unjust laws, no matter how trivial they want to impeach the president over it. 2.) cabbies are generally old men in singapore, and old people in singapore demand a level of respect that we are not raised to care about. our parents are the hippies, the ""call me by my first name"" types who didn't want to be like the stuffy ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" elders of their time. we feel comfortable talking to a 60 year old uncle the same way we would talk to a 20 year old. the 60 year old singaporean is generally super indignant and uncomfortable with that in cases of conflict, feeling the youth should give way to them. this righteous indignation may cause taxi men to escalate confrontations that don't need escalating, and drunk passengers will be all too willing to worsen the escalation. i don't have any personal experience with this, i like to strike up a conversation with a taxi uncle if they're willing, and they've always been super nice to me. this opinion is based on interactions with my new singaporean family-in-law, i expect some taxi uncles must have this sort of disposition when they're confronted with behavior they consider unacceptable. 3.) civilians cannot detain people here except under very serious, specific situations. felonies, purse snatching and shoplifting are some examples of this (depending on jurisdiction) but petty squabbles are not. so we're raised to believe that it's ok to kick the shit out of someone doing this to us. if he really did snatch the guys stuff, then that is grounds enough for civilian detention even in most of the us. 4.) racism / classism. people generally look at a cabbie as a servant, not an equal, and are likely to treat them as such. due to singapore's unique situation, that maybe isn't how you all feel about it, but in the usa our cabbies are most often uneducated immigrants who barely speak english. in some cities i've been to they're rude as hell which can help foster a huge disrespect for their field. if you are in a smaller city, you may have a low-paid local driver, but it's rare to find that. i've worked in the service industry, and dealing with righteous holier-than-thou customers every day is a brutal, soul draining experience. it takes a strong disposition to take that crap every day and stay polite. so i imagine the taxi men may have a short fuse when it comes to indignant, uppity foreigners and maybe they try to put them in their place, escalating confrontations with asshole foreigners. these are obviously just stream-of-thought guesses, but it looks like i wrote a thesis on it now. what has to be the #1 reason is that drunk people can be aggressive and extremely illogical in their interactions. cabbies are their only transportation option late at night. therefore some of that aggression is going to be taken out on the cabbies.",['shbazjinkens'],04/11/2015,9,taxi,Negative

""why?"" to which he said he is on break. ok, i was willing to let it go. but two seconds later, as he slowly went past me, he asked a group of three where they are going, and they said marina bay sands and he allowed them to go into his taxi. i was beyond pissed off. if he was really on break, then don't go and ask any other passengers where they are going, just go to your fucking break. so, i took a photo of the license plate of the taxi (which turned out to be important) as he left the taxi stand. so, when i got home, i called lta hotline to report the incident. i gave an estimate of the time and location of where i was when the incident happened and the scenario as it happened. someone took it down and an lta officer got back to me a few days later via phone to confirm some details. the taxi turd denied this happened and said that based on my reported timeline, given verbally during the taxi hotline, he was at another location as verified from his taxi gps. i insisted to the lta officer that this was not fabricated and i have his taxi registration number and was able to tell the lta officer that the facts of the incident i.e. he was at mbfc, refused my fare, and then went on to send a group of three to marina bay sands. i was told to go to the lta office to get my statement recorded and sign it; which i went there and got that done. when i was at the lta office, i remembered that i took a photo of the taxi license plate.. and i realized that my initial reported timing was ten minutes late. the photo i took had metadata containing location and time. so the lta investigating officer reviewed the timeline and found what i reported had reconciled. lo and behold three weeks later when i asked the lta investigating officer for an update, he reported back to me that the driver was given a fine and suspension, as per the ""scheduled offences under vlps"" so, take a stand against these assholes. i encountered too many of them in the past and am just so pissed that whenever i encounter them, i will rinse and repeat the process.. even though it may take about 60 to 90 minutes of my day to go to lta office and lodge a report.",['konek'],20/09/2017,7,taxi,Positive

"if at the end of the day, car ownership is about mobility, owning a car is simply ensuring instant access to mobility for the car owner. now, can we separate such instant access to mobility from ownership? yes, we can, to a great extent with uber/grab, taxis, car sharing schemes and driverless cars in future. they are of cos not perfect substitutes but in a small place like singapore, close enough. and as for the perceived prestige that comes with owning a car, it is not for the government to try to do anything about that, the same way we should not regulate how grand weddings are. to alleviate the high costs of coes for cars, and to be more equitiable at the same time, coes should not be a fixed amount applied to all cars but rather a percentage of the omv. there will be only 1 category for all cars but there will be no difference in the mechanism determining the cut off. people will bid not a for fixed amount but a percentage and the lowest successful percentage will be applied across the board for all cars. therefore, a family man buying a kia cerato to send his kids to school and his parents to elder daycare will pay much less than a rich man son buying a ferrari. this will also push buyers towards smaller, less polluting cars. but, alas, i fear there will be a negative impact of reduced revenue from coes will render such a scheme unfeasible. commercial vehicles should be split into light and heavy categories but can continue to bid actual price. lta should make use of economic data to help determine the distribution between light or heavy vehicles and adjust allocation accordingly. and finally, recognising that class 2b motorcycles are private motorized transport of last resort, coes for class 2b motorcycles should be released to all who apply for one at a nominal rate of $10. should the demand for class 2b motorcycle outstrip supply for that particular fortnight, these coes should be ""stolen"" open cat coes at a rate of 7 motorcycle coes per 1 open cat coe. my personal instant mobility device is my bicycle.",['bonkers05'],30/10/2017,6,taxi,Positive

"in every country, taxis exist to provide a public service by getting paying customers from where they are to where they want to go. no extra fees are involved for things like booking online, paying by credit card/electronic payment, etc., because the taxi operator understands that a) if he doesn't provide the service, his competitors will, and b) it's a drop in the bucket compared to the increased revenue and profits. taxis in singapore exist to provide yet another means of transferring money from ordinary people to those above. in the process, they lease cabs profitably to (mostly) older uncles who need to support themselves and their families after being turned out of their ""normal"" careers because they're ""too old"". (there's one taxi brand that seems to have more than their fare share of dubious characters/likely triad members as drivers, but their reputation is getting around). in other words, it's like democracy in singapore. there are cabs on the street, just as there are mps in parliament, leading the unwary to assume that those things work pretty much as they do elsewhere. attempting to put that assumption into useful practice is rarely as successful as betting one's entire income on the 4d. (providing yet another demonstration of the word ""assume"" as shorthand for ""making an @$$ out of u and me"".) having a taxi system in singapore that functions comparably to those elsewhere will, like anything else benefitting the ordinary person here, take a change of government priority more than sufficient to require a change of government.",['jdickey'],05/11/2014,2,taxi,Positive

"personally, while i am subscribed to the $59 plan (10x$10 vouchers), i find that it isn’t really that much cheaper than go-jek in the long term. the reason for this is because grab rides tend to be expensive. for example, i am effectively paying $6 for $10 a ride, which means savings of $4 per ride. however, i find that grab rides tend to cost $2-3 more than go-jek rides on average. so i am really just saving $1-2 per ride. sometimes, the difference can even be $5 or more. currently, i am a pretty heavy user of ride-sharing as i have an aged parent with leg issues and it’s just too troublesome to use public transport. my advice is that if you feel that ride-sharing is more convenient, then go with it. you will probably want to just compare prices between grab and go-jek and go with the cheaper option. however, in times of surge, i will try and flag a taxi by the road (with varying levels of success). it really depends on the situation, but i will say not to too “loyal” to any one option and simply go with whichever is more viable at that point.",['ngrenjie'],29/11/2019,2,taxi,Positive

"that's a pretty comprehensive post. i have two things to ask you. first -- you mention supply and demand. how does grab (or uber) know this well? let me give you a scenario (below). supply: the market has moved beyond its early days. we can have a driver who uses both grab and uber and periodically switches one off. add comfort to the mix and the office goers who have gotten onto grab hitch. add to this a dense city where many factors not applicable to traditional routing affect on-street hailing (uber famously decided to reduce its dependence on google maps for this reason). with these, it is hard to have a *stable* algorithm that predicts and identifies supply. demand: people shop for better prices leading to lost conversions. the app can also be opened for other reasons (checking points) instead of booking a ride. grab would not know when i am looking to book a ride until i press book. same should be the case for uber. second -- you mentioned justification of prices. while i agree that prices can be arbitrary in a competitive market eg the 1000$ iphone, people have a sense of they are willing to pay and what seems expensive. riders might accept a ride - but an exorbitant one *affects their sentiment negatively*. this is much like higher transport prices cause discontent among people. drivers are perhaps a different ballgame - i don't have much insight there.",['inno7'],20/09/2017,1,taxi,Positive

i don’t know. as far as grab’s contractual obligation admittedly i will say i don’t know. i said what i said because the driver was on the phone with grab’s support staff on loudspeaker, and i asked “if i’m already in the car and made the booking and he didn’t cancel before hand, is he obliged to drop me at my destination”. the service staff on the phone replied the driver with “sorry mr koh, but you do have to drive them there”. that’s when the aggression on his end escalated and i had no intention to fight. i’ll say this for the last time - what i posted on facebook was done out of character and not something i would typically do. it’s not a valid excuse and it is something that was clearly wrong of me. so this apology here goes out to everyone and anyone who felt that i went overboard. you can continue thinking i’m full of crap, am a joke or whatever. but on my end, i am officially apologising for letting my emotional bias and state cloud my logic and rationality. i will face the consequences for my actions (on the phone with the npc io i did mention that if he’s not going to give me the officer’s identity, i will pay for it). but all that being said, tl;dr, this is not me flip flopping. this is me realising what i did was out of character, wrong, and not right to do so. i will be deactivating social media just to take some time to reflect on these actions of mine. for the ones who said mean things here on this thread i think you have every right to because what i did was rude, condescending, very overboard and not right at all however much you wanna think it’s a csb or true. but for the ones who spoke kindly after i explained myself, i thank you for the kindness. i’ll freely admit this - my personal life has taken a huge hit this past month and i have not been the most stable person out there. to the one who suggested i need help, i’m not ashamed to share on a public forum i’ve been seeking psychiatric treatment (reason i don’t drive) and counselling. but again, this is no excuse for my behaviour. the driver and officers did me wrong, but i should have handled the situation better. i don’t ask that you accept my apology or for this backlash to stop. i know when i wake up there will be more criticism and i’m prepared for it. but as of right now, i apologise to every soul here who has taken offence to my actions and words. this is me genuinely saying i’m sorry, this is not something i would usually do, i acted out of character, and you guys have taught me that i should not just think twice but in fact ten times before i react out of emotional anger. i will be thinking twice about the lawsuit regarding the driver (on hindsight my second option is overboard as someone pointed out how he was just doing his job and he has a family to feed). but sexual harassment is not right, and i will find a way to contact him, and i will make an effort to try and get him to understand why i was offended by his actions. as far as the police are concerned, the io knows i want to report the officer and what’s i said about paying for his information. the use of the word “bounty” came across too much, and again it was wrong of me. i will be a man and face whatever consequence they throw at me for my actions. i’d like to thank the ones here to reminded me of the illegal bits of what i posted - when you’re blinded by anger it’s easy to say things without thinking. whether you think this is a faux apology i can’t control what you think. but this is the sincerest way i can think of to apologise to the community. i am genuinely sorry for overreacting, being rude, overbearing, arrogant, and just being an all around douchebag. i humbly apologise to anyone who reads this. goodnight.",['None'],16/04/2018,41,private hire,Negative

"""no incentives because i chose the highest fares available and my ar drop to 40%."" well if you're driving for grab, that's your mistake right there. right now their passenger rates are really low, so to compensate their driver bonuses are really high. skipping the bonuses is quite a bad idea. i drive regularly for grab, i make about $25 an hour after petrol and grab's incentives (but before considering the rather large cost of a car). you can rent most cars for under $75 a day, so it takes 21 hours a week of driving to pay for the car itself. after that, $5-600 in my pocket per week. a lot of that is the incentives... grab basically controls their driver supply through the incentive systems. no incentive at all is really painful. edit: i don't really know the specifics of the tribecar deal. it might not actually be worth it. but from what i can see, the other half of your problem is that your total # of trips + fares is really awful. during the same time period today, i drove nine trips, total fare of $121.50 (which is actually pretty low), and my incentives should end up somewhere around $35 i think. so if you'd made $155 gross, you'd have netted about $93. not great for six hours, but not awful for a job that lets you sit in aircon and socialize. better than the grease pits of mcds... extra extra edit: why the heck are you making three stops for petrol? that's a huge time sink, given that you're paying so per hour to rent the car. is this some part of tribecar's deal? if so that does suck. if not... refuel once only, on the way back to the car depot.",['mukansamonkey'],13/12/2016,15,private hire,Positive

"i was driving grab full time for 2 weeks last month while waiting for school to start, so i have some experience and hopefully can answer your questions. i drive about 14-16h a day, 7 days a week, typically from 7am-1pm, then 3pm-1am. the peak period starts at around 7am, if you start earlier, there's a chance you might end up in cbd too early and have to go back to the heartland area for better fares. after lunch, things start to quieten down a bit and picks up again at about 4pm, so if you want some rest or shut-eye, this is the best time to do so. the evening peak hours and nights tend to be better in terms of job availability, and i normally drive until i get a job that brings me closer to home, and then go offline from there. on a typical day, i drive about 400-500km. by doing so, i earn a revenue of about high $400s to low $500 a day, but it can sometimes get up to high $500s if it's your lucky day. after deducting rental ($87/day), petrol (~$30/day) and commission (20% of fares which is about $80-$100), i can take home about high $200s to low $300s a day, which works out to be about $20/hr of profit. however, i have to say there is quite a fair bit of day to day variability, which i cannot account for since i have not driven long enough to notice a trend. perhaps other drivers can help you better there. in the 16 days i've worked for, i earned about $4000, and if you maintain for a month, it shouldn't be difficult to earn about $8000, given that there are some days that i did not drive a full day. as for the incentives, the most recent update severely limited what we can earn in terms of incentives, with each gem (think of it as points) giving you $0.40, instead of about $0.85 last time. they also have a rental rebate, which gives you back 6% (i think) of your fares to offset your car rental. gojek is definitely better for incentives, esp the most recent one. if you hit the max target in a day, you get an extra $205 of profit, which is certainly doable if you drive the whole day. they recently upped the incentive, but i haven't checked it out in detail, so i can't help you there. however, i do have to agree with what the others have said. gojek's matching seem to be quite flawed, as i had a few jobs where i had to drive about 10 minutes to get to the customer, and there is some waiting around involved during the lull hours. the fares seem to be lower on gojek as well, but to put it in another perspective, regardless of whether you drive on grab or gojek, the fares of the jobs you get will always be lower since most customers are price sensitive and would opt for the cheaper option anyways. hope this helps clarify! feel free to pm me if you need more info",['FSJZ'],09/07/2019,9,private hire,Positive

"tldr: always the case? noooo. salary generally being higher, yes. but that's because the cost of living is also higher. need to make quite a bit of lifestyle change if you want to save more, or as much as in sg. anecdotally, i myself found that i could save more in sg than in sydney. * **food**. in sg almost everyone tapaus or eat out. in aus tapauing is much more ex, e.g. a caipng (rice with 2 dishes, no differentiation between meat or vege) is usually aud10. of course got outliers e.g. 1 hour before closing at 4pm tapau rice + 1 dish is aud5, which is probably the cheapest you can get for a meal in sydney, but you'll have to be there at the right time. are you able to drive to the food court to grab this at 4pm while you're working? probably not. * of course most people cook their own meals here, and we should also do that, but you'll have to sacrifice some time (e.g. 1/2 hour) everyday for that, or cook once during weekend and reheat over the week. like i said, need to make lifestyle changes, and we found it difficult to start cooking frankly, much easier to think about what we wanna eat then go buy it. * **transport**: car is definitely much much cheaper here, can get laopok car for aud1k, but for a good 2nd hand car maybe about aud10k lah. new car maybe aud30k. and while the public transport isn't absolutely terrible, there's a lot of places you can't reach without a car. and with a car comes associated costs. tax + insurance = 100/month, maybe monthly fuel costs = 200, maybe a averaged yearly maintenance + fixes = 500, lets say 50/month, that will be 350/month at least, not including the down payment for the car. think sg is about [150/month for transport](https://www.guidemesingapore.com/relocation/introduction/singapore-cost-of-living)? * of course you get the freedom of having a car, and personally i love it, with the great australian road system, and i love going on long road trips, so much cheaper than flights and freedom to stop whenever you want. we drove from syd to melbourne and syd to brisbane the first few years we were here, i loved it. * **housing**: i think housing is about the same if you're renting. buying is a totally different story that i'm currently painfully experiencing personally, so we won't go there. anyway i think there are many more places that elaborate on details with much more sources than me, this is just a personal anecdote. i always tell people singapore is good for working, sydney is good for living. in singapore a lot of things are geared towards you spending more time at work (maid = less time cleaning the house yourself, shops open late > 5pm, more corporate hqs in sg = better career advancements), whereas in sydney you have more time for life, but more things to do (can leave work at 5pm, but need to cook/clean house/mow backyard/fix car).",['greenlamb'],27/02/2017,3,private hire,Positive

"with exception of tesla most bev from major carmakers are sold officially here. kona, niro, zoe, ipace, taycan. one reason they sell poorly is due to high road tax. tax structure in place dates back from 2008 and is based on kw rating which becomes obscenely high for a modern ev. kona for example has same road tax as a 3 litre v6 petrol(about 2200/year). a toptrim taycan or model s will have over 12000/year in road tax, almost double a w12 bentley or v12 rolls royce. comparing running cost for an average driver using petrol car or ev and the petrol unfortunately comes out ahead due to roadtax. another reason is charging possibilities whether real or perceived. there has been huge improvement of this past year with sp fast chargers and other smaller initiatives such as bluesg mentioned here. now just need something for all hdb carparks. one more reason is the additional ves rebate for ev is minor compared to overall price and comparing to hybrids. next year with vw id3, volvo xc40 electric there may be a change as at least you will have more attractive proper premium ev on the market here despite the other cons i mentioned. without any revision to policies pricing in emissions or incentives to choose ev over ice it will be very slow ev adoption process in sg. i really hope this changes asap.",['ja_eriksson'],13/12/2019,3,private hire,Positive

"most of my grab rides involve a lot of idle chatter but one conversation left an indelible impression. this took place some time ago, back when uber was still around. i booked a ride to hougang around 7ish one morning and a lady driver accepted my booking. since it was the weekend, i was curious why she’s already up and about so early, so i asked her. turns out she’s a single mom and she drives an average of 12 to 15 hours a day (with little breaks in between) so she can make enough to raise her son. her mother cares for her boy when she’s working, hence i am assuming she needs to cover her mother’s expenses too. that’s a huge responsibility to shoulder for one person. i told her that what she’s doing is truly commendable, but she needs to take care of her health too. driving such long hours on the road is no joke. besides, fatigue can lead to accidents too. i also learnt that she tends to skip meals when she receives back-to-back bookings on a stretch. before i alighted, i told her that she might be able to make a small fortune if she persists at this rate, but the long-term health risks are hardly worth it. she should also spend more time with her kid before his childhood is forever lost in time. experiences like these remind me that every single driver has a story to tell, good or bad. some drive to pass time, some do it to get by, some do it to raise a family.",['None'],14/08/2019,1,private hire,Positive

"you can't deny the convenience of being able to book your taxi anytime anywhere without surcharge. it's amazing how taxi companies still have a surcharge for booking taxis even when there are alternatives that are clearly leveraging on this situation. if you do a flag down, the chances of the taxi driver just rolling down the window and asking ""go where?"" and then driving off if it doesn't fit their preferred location is also substantial. if there weren't any blacksheep like these then the taxi services might be more trusted, but no. the companies chose to do nothing despite these situations being complained about since a long time ago. about time they experience what true open market is, unlike the bullshit with the actual mrt system. smrt hasn't had a real competitor to their operations for decades, now they learn what it's like.",['MrFoxxie'],11/11/2017,87,mrt,Positive

"not only that, the design of the digital screen looks rather amateurish and made by a primary school kid. for example, the closing doors animation looked like it was made with a flash game back in 2003, and the font just looks like the default font that is used in microsoft word. personally, the way i would fix this is to essentially make a digital version of the led-backlit board where they show you a station map, and activate the lights on the next and following stations. while it may be practical for customers, the issue is that when a new station opens up (for example, canberra), they would have to redo the backlighting and create new boards for all of them, which is not very practical and also expensive for smrt. thus, this is where the digital display could prove it's worth. the digital version of the old display could be updated easily. new stations and lines could simply be added to the map via a software update. and besides, the display is clearly capable of doing that. they could simply stretch the map across the two screens.",['iDexPro'],22/11/2019,71,mrt,Positive

"some preliminary thoughts. first, [i went to look at the actual changes to the formula in another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/86gawj/premiumnew_fare_formula_raises_questions_about/dw5chp9/?context=0). the uncertainty around the new formula is because we have no idea what the new ncf component is going to be. we've been given the formula for ncf, but the actual value is unknown as it seems to depend on information that is not publicly available. so we don't know if it's going to come up to +10% or -10%. there is a 3.2% reduction carried over from previous years but i also don't know how it will be applied this year. second, a cynical jab at this quote: > the possible change in the public transport fare formula was hinted at by transport minister khaw boon wan in the committee of supply debates earlier this month. he said subsidised fares were “popular but unsustainable” due to planned infrastructural upgrades. how much you wanna bet it will become super sustainable as soon as the pap loses seats due to this issue? ugh. third, i wonder what part of the increasing cost of maintaining infrastructure is self-inflicted. rumour mill is that smrt didn't prioritise the necessary maintenance and we all know that it's much more painful to clean house one time once a month than to do small regular cleaning weekly. so to the extent that these costs are self-inflicted if at all, why should we be bearing any part of it? fourth, i admit and agree that one thing i think we as citizens cannot run away from, is that we are really paying quite little for our public transport. someone somewhere has to pay for it, right? but with infrastructure with lta and the rest of smrt with temasek (as a result of self-inflicted screw-ups, mind) it feels like we are already paying for it, and now being asked to pay more. how much more can we be squeezed? economy is supposed to have grown but like i said in another recent comment it certainly doesn't feel like it's growing. real wage increases still go to the top few percentiles, for whom mrt is just an abstract thing they just need to make sure is within 200m of their 4th property so they can rent it out at a markup. fifth, just to vent. this fucking cheebye smrt made so much money last time and now we are dealing with this shit. whoever made these decisions made out like bandits leaving us with these remains. sometimes i really fucking hate the world. what is the lesson i am supposed to learn here? near as i can tell, it is: work hard to fuck other ppl over, and get out before you yourself get fucked. fuck.",['theony'],23/03/2018,28,mrt,Negative

"i’ve lived in california for a year so feel free to pm me/reply if you have other specific questions! 1) physical and online stores are both flourishing in singapore. you will be able to get your shopping done through online stores like lazada, qoo10, or walking to the nearest mall. amazon prime exists, but has less options than in the us. 2) people love dogs. you can’t keep some pets in public housing but if you move over in private housing there are no restrictions. 3) dog sitting is super common. there are pet shops that will do that service for you in many shopping malls. 4) leases are also expensive. $1600-1800 per month for “normal” japanese 5 seater cars. very few suvs because it’s not popular and more expensive. 5) credit scores don’t exist. your available credit is tied to your monthly income, credit history only matters if you repeatedly don’t pay up. all major payment methods are accepted. mastercard/visa/america expresss. we have many bank-linked mobile payments similar to venmo. we don’t have chase discover cards though. 6) anywhere is good, public transportation is at most 5 mins away and runs every 15-40 mins at most. you can choose somewhere near a mrt station (our subway). it covers almost all of singapore. 7) discrimination here is far less than in the us. unfortunately people here are less sensitive about such issues and can make very inappropriate statements. 8) working from home / working remotely is not a norm. some jobs allow working remotely a few times a month, but you are expected to be in the workplace the majority of the time. there are exceptions, but this is the general rule. 9) yes, very easy. there are many maid employment agencies. but they are usually domestic workers, meaning they live with you and take care of housekeeping / meals. having a temp-maid is possible, but not the norm. 10) childcare can be insanely expensive, especially for non-essential education (essential education is nearly free). we are an asian culture where every resource is not spared in order to raise children. after-school tuition, music classes, sports classes, dance classes, daycares, you name it and it exists. the demand for such services by every single parent drives prices sky-high. it is not uncommon to spend several hundreds to thousands per month.",['Wormsblink'],04/10/2018,20,mrt,Positive

"this was donald low's interpretation on a fairly similar topic. this was in an article discussing what went wrong for the pap post ge 2011. he used to be the director of the strategic policy office at the public service division. >hdb’s experience of a housing boom, followed by a collapse of the bubble and the consequent glut of unsold flats—left a permanent scar in the psyche of housing planners in government. the same conclusion applies to our transport policies as well and in particular, the development of new mrt lines >throughout the early 2000s, mof routinely turned down requests from mot and lta to finance new rail lines. these decisions (many of which i was involved in) were made on the basis of the government’s recent experiences with the northeast line. government had approved the nel on the premise that there would be new, large public housing estates in punggol and sengkang. these projections were made during the fast growth years before the asian crisis. but the late 1990s and early 2000s turned out to be much more sluggish economically than planners had expected. the formation of new households slowed, and the new estates of punggol and sengkang failed to take off as government had originally anticipated >like public housing, the construction of subway lines involves long, and sometimes uncertain, time lags. thus, when the singapore economy finally picked up momentum after 2006, transport planners found themselves woefully behind in the construction of new train lines. this problem was compounded by the fact that throughout the early 2000s, mof had pursued a policy of lowering car ownership taxes (to reduce the tax burden on singaporeans) and to rely instead of congestion charges to manage any increase in road congestion. the combination of these policies—the relatively slow development of the mrt network and rapid reductions in the cost of car ownership—led to many more cars on singapore’s roads, with the inevitable consequence of congestion. so other than the signalling faults, this explains why there is a sudden onslaught of mrt stations being built. the govt fucked up, they know they fucked up and are now trying to catch their tails.",['runebound2'],07/07/2017,17,mrt,Positive

"(most) grab drivers appear to have been trained in treating passengers like passengers which means unless you speak to them, they're typically quiet and drive carefully. if you do speak to them about their life etc, they are also quite cheery in sharing and do not talk about sensitive, polarizing topics like race/religion/politics. taxi drivers, especially older men, tend to talk down to me (young female here) about life, telling me to do a degree as though my life depended on it, how and when to get married, how and when to have babies, attitudes about foreigners and singaporeans of other races, why the government sucks. i've tried popping my headphones in, and all that does is: \*removes headphones ""sorry, what did you say?"" whenever the taxi driver would say anything, because it might be pertinent to the actual ride like ""which exit to turn"" etc. perhaps i am averse to confrontations. i don't want to accidentally offend someone i'm actually paying money to drive me to my destination. driving is another factor. maybe it's because grab drivers are actually rated by passengers... i find that typically, the driving is pretty decent and there's nothing to complain about. taxi drivers on the other hand get pissed off every 2 minutes, and drive like they're late to the airport. i've had to, on more than one occasion, tell the taxi driver that i am not in a rush for time and casually ""the most important thing is safety"".",['sinchonexit2'],01/04/2019,15,mrt,Positive

"i'm here to partially rant and go on about this idea of a smart nation, if any of you believe that this idea is anywhere close to being conceptualized by our city. so this cashless transport system thing is part of a greater plan called the smart nation plan, for those of you who have not read the article. the smart nation plan is to transform a city into one that uses technology to improve efficiency and make life faster, in a nutshell. this can be seen through automation of payment counters at ntuc, digitalization of directories at shopping centres and also this topic of cashless payment. i was part of a small project to incoporate smart city planning in the form of data analytics and visualization. this project is supposed to give essential data to engineers, but somehow our scope became skewed to include the general public in our end user scoping. therefore, instead of training and processing data, our focus became more 'art' based and its supposed to draw the general public in with pretty visualizations and fascinating pictures. so i clarify my thoughts on smart city being 'art' based. the problem isn't with the usage of nice and pretty visualizations, but the blatant attempt to make a smart city very pretty looking to hide from the users, the truth of our technological progress being very backwards. so what does this mean? the government is essentially trying to coerce the people into thinking that a smart city nation is the way to go in singapore. considering we're a forerunner in this, it would be a 'wow this initiative would make us at the forefront of technology in the world' right? actually no. we are crazy behind the rest of the world in technology. and i don't mean that our generation of 18-30 know how to use facebook and snapchat, its that we don't have proper mentors to guide us in the advanced stuff like machine learning and artificial intelligence. of course we have university professors but they're just academia, do keep in mind that there are phds around the world who are not tied to academia who are developing far more intricate algorithms with processors with as many cores as the amount of cai png you bought over a month. well if you think about it, deep blue which is a computer developed by ibm beat a world chess player at the time gary kasparov in 1996. so now think about it, where in the world were we at 1996? we are not a smart nation, don't even believe for a second that we are. our nation still runs on the blood and sweat of immigrants from foreign countries who have not even seen a computer and couldn't tell the difference between a file and an application in your windows desktop screen. this is not an insult to them, but they are not the ones running the tech in their country, so this is to be expected of them. what im trying to say here is, the demographics of the people using the smart city tools is not the same as the people who are here to stabilize our country, nor the people who have helped bring this country to this economic point. in sociological terms, this is 'segregation' and in antropological terms, the deepening of 'social fault lines'. google these terms if you aren't familar with them. at this point im going to remind people that this isn't a criticism of cashless transport, but the bigger goal of a smart nation. and also i'm going to thrown in an example here -> changi airport terminal 4. a fully automated airport with close to 0 physical staff and q&as are answered by bots who use machine learning algos to answer question. think siri. this is an idealistic terminal that encapsulates in its entirety, the advent of a smart city. just take a look around the damn place it is fucking sweet. it is also confusing for the people from lower denominations who are not used to technology, once again this is an issue of segregation, and the expectations of the executive decision makers in the changi airport group. another way to segregate our society from the 'tech-savvy' ones from the non 'tech-savvy' ones. for most of you in reddit, you don't see the problem because we are all familiar with technology. and honestly this isn't a problem for most of us. sorry for the rant",['R_Creation'],15/08/2017,13,mrt,Positive

"i will chime in on a few things where i have different info or opinions from other posters... my family and i moved from texas to sg and lived in sg for nearly two years. regarding dogs, you should check what breeds are allowed and which aren’t. if either of your dogs has any pit bull in them (for example) you won’t be able to import them. when you move, i advise you to look for a service to help with the paperwork. however, i advise you to look for an airline that will carry your dogs as excess baggage. otherwise the cost of relocating your dogs will be very high... we paid nearly $10k to fly our dogs to singapore as cargo. flying them back to the us cost $400 as excess baggage. with regards to cars, you should evaluate whether you really need a car. cars are super expensive. leases are expensive. for the amount of money you’d spend on a lease or a purchase you could instead find a place close to the mrt and take taxis and come out ahead. try living without one before you spend $150k+ sgd for a car you can keep for a max of 10 years. with regard to discrimination, it isn’t overt. but the culture is definitely mysogenistic. people would talk to me first before my wife, and people coming to do work on our house almost always insisted in talking to me instead of my wife, even if i wasn’t home. that really bothered her. regarding maids, you can hire someone to come clean a couple of times a week, and the cost is probably comparable to hiring a maid in the us. you can also hire a live in maid, and her pay would be something on the order of $500-$800 sgd per month depending on experience. she will cook, clean, do laundry, run errands, get groceries, take care of kids and dogs, etc. you have to pay her salary and provide room and board. maids work six days a week, with sunday’s and public holidays off. have our “helper” was the single best experience we had in singapore. worth every penny. we treated her well, and she loved our daughter and dogs. we stay in touch despite being back in the us for two years. bonus... you won’t need a dog sitter. other bit of advice is to hire a professional in the us and another in sg to help handle income taxes. pm for more info or if you have additional questions.",['TaborToss'],05/10/2018,10,mrt,Positive

"i'll talk a bit about transport. assuming you're taking the train to and from work each day, that'll cost you on average $2 a trip and $4 a day? 20 working days makes that $80. add a lot of miscellaneous transport expenses and you should be able to keep it to less than $150 a month per person on transport without too much hassle. buy your goods at ntuc, sheng shiong or the wet market. the $10 melon is from medi-ya which is more of a specialised store downtown that mainly sells japanese goods. i won't be surprised if you find $100 grapes, but don't use that for comparison. if you really want to find the absolute best deal, try this site https://www.diffmarts.com/. it gives price comparisons for the major supermarkets in singapore (including redmart). ntuc always has random sales for random fruits depending on season. there's a $1.90 for 250g blueberries sale going in at least three ntucs i visited in the past week. cold storage is another chain that we all know as slightly more upmarket in terms of price and products. if you live near a town centre (e.g. woodlands, tampines, jurong) you can probably get more than one supermarket to choose from. you can also get great food from hawker centres. there's at least one near you in every town. you can get a good variety of food for a very good price (think less than $5 a meal). which is to say you don't have to force yourself to cook every day if your schedule doesn't permit, there's affordable food all around. a mid-tier restaurant would set you back about $15-20 per person. movies on the weekends cost about $14 depending on theater.",['chinese-man'],30/04/2017,10,mrt,Positive

"ahh i have a fair share of stories to share but i shall just name one in particular. about 9 months ago, as i was travelling from pasir ris to see my orthopaedic doctor as i had sustained a spinal injury, i actually sat down on a reserved seat that day. i was in pain and couldn't stand for long. i also needed the handrails to get myself seated or to get out of the seat. when my train passed by simei, a self-entitled lady came on board with her umbrella. it was not crowded that day and there were many empty spaces for her to stand, however, she chose to stand in front of me. as much as i wanted to give up the seat, i wasn't able to as i was in pain. then a lady whom sat on the 3rd seat, voluntary gave up her seat to this lady. however, this self entitled lady declined and said loudly saying how i should have gave up the seat to her as reserved seats are only meant for old people and not young people like me. as she kept on ranting and ranting, my dad whom was seated beside me, told the lady politely that i was injured and that i needed the seat and even offered to show the x-ray that i had on hand. mind you, this lady didn't seem to bother and kept on ranting. she was definitely in a better shape than i am as she quickly walked to the next cabin after my dad nearly wanted to confront her. however, i could still hear her ranting from where i am. the 3rd seat was thus later occupied by another commuter after the lady volunteered to give up the seat. then, there came another lady whom had asked me for the seat. i politely declined and she was totally cool with it unlike the self-entitled one. luckily for her, the person whom sat on the 3rd seat gave her seat up to her, and she was very grateful to that person. my dad and i apologized profusely to this lady as we tried to explain why we couldn't give up the seat. the lady actually was still cool and even said, ""its ok. if someone does not want to give up their seat, its ok. by doing so, im sure he/she must have their own reasons not to. it is actually considered a privilege if someone decides to give up their seat to you."" after hearing what she said, it really makes me thankful to at least have people thinking this way. it doesn't mean if a person who has an injury that is not visible with the naked eye, or who is unwell that day, is not entitled to seating on the reserved seat. seats are still seats no matter what. one does not simply demand a person to vacate their seat just because he or she looks physically fit on the outside. you can't judge based on a person physical appearance as you do not know what kind of battles they are fighting.",['puggiepanda'],03/10/2019,10,mrt,Positive

"two of the battles featured prominently here, among others, are that of laborers vs capital owners, and low-wage laborers vs high-wage laborers. i've promised to address these, and so here we are: the issue of capital vs labor is a complicated one to tackle. corporate tax is not something we want to mess with, because it is one of the major reasons mncs are drawn to singapore. in a skills-based economy, where value is often held more in ip and ideas than in machines and buildings, it's so much easier to move your holdings around. this provides a major incentive for singapore to keep corporate taxes reasonably low. one way to improve this situation is education - if workers provide more value to mncs, then workers get more than they would otherwise. the question of the labor share of income is a more complicated one and one i'm sure a macroeconomist would love to discuss in more depth. suffice it to say that my knowledge of production is not enough to address this adequately, but the problem is more complex than ""just tax corporations more"". we've seen the effects of just this in both directions - the flight of ip to the us as a result of the midterm tax cuts, as well as an influx of mncs from the uk as a result of brexit and its implications for market access. the difference between high- and low-wage laborers has been something that's prevalent in public economics for a while. it used to be significantly worse (10 or so years ago), but we've since taken great strides in improving redistribution. there's definitely much more that could be done here, but the problem is not so much about the price of goods. i've already mentioned that the link between the welfare of low-wage workers and prices of necessities is tenuous at best; the middle class is, for example, not really bothered about the price of mrt rides and the price of cai png. these are working class problems. the burgeoning middle class - households who typically earn upwards of 7-8k a month (that's the median wage) - are typically more concerned with large assets rather than day-to-day expenditures. we're talking about things like resales, condominiums, land prices, cars, and so on. suppose i grant you an increase in prices in necessities as well as wages; then, the people that are most affected will be those low-wage workers you are trying to help. they don't have a choice of substituting away from necessities as the middle-class and wealthy do (to cooking, traveling to eat, hiring househelp, moving closer to the city, etc). the increased wages will go back into paying more for necessities, which means that really what you're doing is making the employer better off. what i'm suggesting here is there is a problem that's different than ""the poor are disadvantaged because stuff is too cheap"", and you should think through either improving that chain in logic, or considering a different argument.",['denunciator'],28/02/2019,8,mrt,Positive

">> food. forget about michelin stars and gourmet food in hk. yeah, great food, hong kongers get to eat goose and amazing dai pai dong food and better seafood, but singaporean food culture wins hands down. better street food culture in the hawker centers, more variety with malay and peranakan food, more spice, more flavour, more intensity and vibrancy. that said, hk isn't too far behind. singapore has better food. in hk, dimsum is great, but otherwise a lot of cha cha tengs are disgusting places using low grade oil and serving stuff like spam and macaroni. other cuisines, like thai and vietnamese get fucked up so bad here it's almost impressive how they manage to do it. even in expensive singapore you can get a delicious chicken rice for 2sgd. you can't get *anything* for that price in hk. the issue is the rent in hk. the rents are jacked up so high that restaurants have to cut back on actual quality meat and ingredients and just douse everything in too much oil and msg. >>vibrancy and character. hong kong wins hands down. less government regulation, more freedom to do whatever you want, people are less afraid to be creative. there's more energy on the streets, a sense of urgency and a pulse that races faster than singapore. the neon lights of hong kong, the old, delapidated buildings add to the noir charm. the cleanliness and blandness of singapore is boring in comparison. translation: hk has more noise, crowds, filthy streets and inconsiderate behaviour. ""sense of urgency"" lol. have you seen how fucking slow people walk here??? >>scenery. hk is way more scenic than singapore. so much more nature, national parks, hiking trails, waterfalls, mountains, real beaches, coast lines. people die from getting lost in the mountains. singapore is more scenic. you can't even see the views in hk because of the constant smog and haze. look at a picture of hk is summer, nice and clear, that's how it *should* look like. but 10 out of 12 months, you have horrible views obscured by grey smog. >>health care. so what that singapore is a hub for medical tourism. the health care is nearly completely free in hk, for hk residents. you can get major heart surgery here and stay in the intensive care unit for months and only have to pay a token sum. major medical issues aren't going to bankrupt you. sure if you're prepared to wait 2 years for major surgery, then yeah. my landlord's helper got beast cancer and was told there'd be a 18 months wait to get proper treatment. also for prostate cancer, 2 years. you'd be dead by then. fuck the puclic system. if you want anything serious done, you need to go private. >>location. weekend trips to japan or taiwan, or even shanghai. a lot more convenient from hk than it is from singapore. who actually has the time, freedom and money to go to fucking japan 'for the weekend'? even if you had, it's still a massive waste of time. all that traveling and expense for basically a day. i don't know anybody here who does that. singapore is actually much better. loads of budget airlines, weekend border trip to malaysia / indonesia, very short travel times *and* cheap. >>public transport. mtr beats mrt. faster, more reliable, larger volume, cheaper. cars are also much cheaper in hong kong. hk mtr has the absolute worst, hardest, shapeless, most uncomfortable seats known to man. that's if you even get a seat, which you never do. tl;dr singapore",['None'],04/08/2018,4,mrt,Positive

"with financial considerations, it's not possible to have express lines. mrt lines have to be financially viable on their own, ie. you cannot use a profit making line to subsidise the operations of a loss making line. express mrt lines are not financially viable on their own or as a parallel express service on existing mrt lines because the cost needed to build the additional pair of tracks is not worth the number of passengers it will benefit. [even if an express parallel service is planned on a new mrt line, i highly doubt it would be financially viable.](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/express-train-service-cross-island-line-table-khaw-boon-wan) remember, more tracks means more land, extended signalling and power systems. they way to go forward is more normal mrt lines that duplicate different sections of the legacy lines (ie. nsewl) and also open up newer intertown connections. also when you compare travelling time, you should compare the time saved vs taking a taxi/phv. your example of a mrt ride from changi airport to buona vista takes 1h 5 min according to google maps. if you drive, it takes between 35 to 45 min during the peak hour. i would say that the 1h 5min is already quite good given the number of people the mrt serves, and it wouldnt do justice to the mrt if you said that the 1h 5min is bad. look at the cost/time. you have to spend much more on a taxi/phv to save that extra 30-40 min. but i still recognise that it could be better, which is why more new lines that duplicate current lines should be the way forward. i personally benefitted from dtl which is a really fast way to town.",['kopipeng'],04/04/2019,2,mrt,Positive

"ah ok. if temasek is already the major shareholder (googling suggests 54.1%) then it would seem smrt is already a special case. as i'm unsure what the rules and regulations are re listed companies and takeovers, i'm not quite sure it's as simple or straightforward as 'majority shareholder can force a buyout of the minority shareholders' (whether resolution by forced sales, dilutions or otherwise); but i do take your point. so since the gahmen is already indirectly in control of smrt, 'renationalisation' may not really amount to much; perhaps just to remove profit pressures; but then again, i would have thought if temasek is still currently a shareholder, the idea has always been to rely on the market pressures to make smrt run better. so in a sense it's arguable that there's really no need for all these relabelling when the gahmen can just direct temasek to run smrt in a way that's more in line with gahmen policy. sure it may result in lower returns and valuation of the company; but - as the argument would go - everyone else benefits. and perhaps in the long run smrt kinda undergoes a transformation that makes it worth even more? i don't know but it seems awfully contrived either way. i mean if ultimately it's a matter of changing the ownership of the shares from temasek to gahmen itself, i would think the difference is only that temasek has a bit more of a expectation to generate a (higher) return on whatever investments it makes. either way it seems you might lose some in your left pocket (less returns to temasek and hence future generations), gain some in your right (if gahmen runs smrt directly maybe it results in some kind of systems wide benefit?); but *perhaps the point is the gain in the right pocket is greater*, in every sense of the word such that whatever loss (in every sense of the word) from the left pocket seems irrelevant. i don't know. tl;dr it's possible shareholder interests and the interests of singaporeans may be in conflict in the case of smrt. so does temasek and gahmen have a conflict in this case? i think perhaps, partly due to the mismatch in time horizons. maybe even short term fuck ups in the mrt system damages the singapore brand in a way so irreversible even future profits might not be able to compensate for it.",['KaseyRyback'],30/10/2015,2,mrt,Negative

"for five days it is a no-brainer to buy the ez-link card. sgd12 per card (sgd7 usable value, sgd5 non-refundable card cost). rides within the city center (where most of the tourist attractions are) cost around sgd1. if you take a ride twice a day, it'll cost you a total of sgd15 (sgd10 for rides and the sgd5 card cost) for five days. in contrast, the three day tourist pass costs sgd20 and you'll need to buy tickets for the last two days. i think you can work out the math. there are also standard one-time-use tickets, but rides tend to cost around double that of the ez-link card rides. if you take more than 5 rides with the ez-link card, you'll easily recoup the cost of the sgd5 card cost. note that you'll have to add value to your ez-link card as you go along. however, you can get a refund on all unused value at the ticketing counters (there's one at changi airport mrt)",['justmewayne'],16/07/2019,2,mrt,Positive

"1) i do agree with you that not all old people are bad. i’ve met aunties who are very nice and saw one of them offering her seat to a sec sch girl who was sleeping when standing (she was supporting her head on her arm) the aunty said “come girl sit down and rest a bit, aunty getting off next stop alr”. like what you said if i had met that aunty during my train ride, my day would have ended up differently. 2) i would like to know how do you define graciousness? when did i behave badly? because i refuse to give up my seat? but i did want to give up my seat, i was just thinking abt how to pack up and was alr packing up before she made that comment. then i proceeded to question her on her comment. do note that all of my replies to her were calm and i didn’t raise my voice bcos i alr said previously that i’m also afraid of the whole being stomp thingy so i want to just avoid as much attention as i can. she was the one who decide to speak loudly and looking around if anyone was looking at us, hoping to attract attention of others so that she can show that she is educating me. so i proceeded to ask her another question in a civilised way because i am truly curious at how she can differentiate a pregnant young woman from young people in general if her perception is that all young people should stand. then should a pregnant young lady stand as well just because her stomach is not showing? you can say that pregnant ladies could have just told the auntie nicely that they are pregnant and the aunty would have understand. but i’m not pregnant so obviously i was gonna to stand and give up the seat to her who, according to social norms, needed it more than me bcos i’m just a lazy person who woke up late to do makeup on a reserved seat and i totally don’t deserve this seat. but even if i wasn’t doing makeup, i would still be in that seat becos why do i need to stand when i don’t need to? but factoring in the makeup part, my reactions were slower when offering seat bcos i have to pack up which led to others offering the seat then thus the auntie’s comment. if i was sitting there without makeup, i would have been able to offer it immediately and maybe don’t have to hear such an awful stereotype comment that she has on young ppl. but even with the make up factor or not, my original intent did not change, i still wanted to give up my seat to her in both situations. so if your idea of behaving badly is me questioning her on her comments, then let me ask you what is wrong with questioning things that i don’t understand or don’t agree on? my so-called bad behaviour didn’t cause her anything, she still got a seat and she wasn’t harmed in any way. i didn’t shout at her so her eardrums are fine too, only maybe her vision is hurt by the sight of my face. also, if your idea of graciousness is me just keeping quiet and suck it up to whatever she said, then nope, can’t do it. i would also like to ask you if you are me in that situation (don’t tell me all those you will wake up early and will nv be in that situation) but if you are in my shoes, ready to get off the seat, the auntie said that comment to the girl beside you just bcos you are slower in offering her a seat, what would you do as a self-gracious person?",['xspongebobz'],04/10/2019,2,mrt,Positive

"> # public transport fares should factor in mrt system’s rising operating costs: khaw > singapore — signalling the need for higher public transport fares, transport minister khaw boon wan on monday (july 8) called for both the fare formula and the next fare revision that is to take place later this year to be reviewed. this is to take into account the rising operating costs of the mrt system. > while he did not explicitly say that fares have to go up, mr khaw pointed out that it would be unsustainable to continue relying on government subsidies to fund public transport infrastructure, adding that subsidies given out “have exceeded their intended scope”. > mr khaw has said several times before that public transport fares needed to be higher. > in february, he said in parliament that increased costs to improve transport reliability will ultimately be shared by taxpayers through government subsidies or commuters through some fare adjustments. > on monday, he said: “as it is, the additional costs have been partly covered by increased government subsidy and partly absorbed by the operators who have been incurring substantial losses. this is certainly not sustainable.” > the minister's latest comments came in response to mr sitoh yih pin, member of parliament for potong pasir, who asked for an update on the current level of rail reliability and how this will be sustained and funded. > mr khaw delved into the issue of funding after updating the house that rail reliability has improved seven-fold since 2015, with the “mean kilometre between failure” — a benchmark for rail reliability performance — rising to more than 950,000 train-km as of last month, > efforts to improve rail reliability, he said, have come at a substantial expense to both operators and the government — a point he already raised in parliament in february when asked about the government grants and subsidies used to cover operating costs of mrt lines. > mr khaw said that between 2016 and 2017, the total cost of running the rail network has gone up by around s$270 million. > and rail companies are operating at a loss since the fares paid by commuters do not cover operating costs. > in the latest reported financial year, smrt trains incurred a loss of s$86 million, while sbs transit’s train division also lost tens of millions of dollars. > as for the government, it has spent around s$1.9 billion to take over ownership of all rail operating assets. while this is a one-off move, mr khaw said, the government is now “also responsible for the proper and timely renewal of these assets and this is a huge and continuing financial liability”. > under the rail financing framework, the government pays for the full upfront cost of civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets, he explained. > subsequent operations and maintenance of operating assets are supposed to be fully paid for by the operators through fares and non-fare revenue such as advertising. > “in practice, as fares have been inadequate to cover the cost of operations, government subsidies have exceeded their intended scope of funding the civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets,” mr khaw told the house. > “with intensified maintenance to reach the current level of reliability, the government’s operating subsidies have increased further.” > he pointed out that over the next five years, the government expects to spend s$4.5 billion — or nearly s$1 billion a year — on operating subsidies. this comes on top of the s$25 billion spending on civil infrastructure to build and equip new lines. > fare formula not strictly followed > mr khaw said that the fare formula determined by the public transport council (ptc) is supposed to keep fares in line with macroeconomic cost factors such as inflation, wages and fuel costs. > the ptc revises public transport fares every year. the fare formula review is typically done by the ptc once every five years, and it was just revised last year. > until recently, the ptc’s fare formula had not been strictly followed, mr khaw said. if it had, the operators would have been “better able to cover the costs of the intensified maintenance”. > mr khaw said that in due course, the ptc will need to review the fare adjustment mechanism to reflect the increased operating cost to support the intensified maintenance efforts and the extra operating subsidies from the government to the mrt system. > in response to today's queries, a ptc spokesperson said that the council will start the annual fare review exercise later this year and undertake a review of the fare formula by 2023. > ""as with all fare review exercises, the council will take into consideration the prevailing developments in the public transport landscape, and strike a balance to ensure that our public transport system is sustainable while keeping fares affordable,"" the spokesperson said. > ""we take the views of all stakeholders, including commuters, taxpayers and operators, seriously in our deliberations."" > though the fare formula now is valid until 2023, mr khaw stressed the need to “have the discipline to implement the formula fully, as we adjust fares over the next four years”. > he said that for the time being, the government will provide operators with a temporary enhanced maintenance grant, with the details being worked out between the transport and finance ministries. > --- 1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",['sneakpeek_bot'],09/07/2019,1,mrt,Negative

"> i'm sure there are equally fulfilling vocations in various different forces but for spf i do agree that being an npco is a life changing experience. first off, getting into spf itself is already pretty cool. like scdf, once you finish training in spf, you're put on the ground and you work alongside the regulars who are the same 'vocation' as you doing the same thing. so there's a lot more equal treatment and people really feel like part of the team. but as for my take: i'm presenting the general view. (also npcos get promoted to sc/sgt regardless of qualification) but just comparing the other big ones in spf like soc or pcg. soc: training, more training and mostly staying in base. don't really 'do' much or learn much (at least not about 'police procedure' as opposed to 'tactical procedure'). when deployed, basically just for presence. pcg: daily patrols unlike the above. but there's hardly any activity. mostly like a glorified sentry on the sea watching out for illegal immigrants. most of the time just sitting in a boat looking at the sea. transcom: i hear the training isn't very good and this is apparent to most people as well. i don't think many people would actually favour this over npco. oct: staff positions mostly. it's useful in a certain way, but for an ns experience to look back on, staff positions can be pretty lame. of course the difference is you can tell others you were an inspector. octs that get posted to line positions, now that's more interesting (e.g. the pcg ano posting isn't too bad). like honestly, npco experience (and the other ones like apd, and even transcom etc) is the one that best carries over to future life. good experiences to share and you learn about dealing with people. yes, dealing with ordinary people not just dealing with uniformed people. problem is npco isn't that easy to get anyway.",['Classifyd'],08/08/2016,1,mrt,Positive

"well... the price mechanism can only bring a *fair* allocation of resources by chance, since equity is a normative claim (afaik). the price mechanism fails more often than not in bringing about an *efficient* allocation anyway because the second welfare theorem only guarantees pareto, not allocative efficiency, and kaldor-hicks reallocation can apparently generate non-transitive consumption bundles because voodoo, i guess. also information asymmetry and all that ^*jazz ^hands* tl;dr: your invisible-hands waifu is shit. *shiiiiiiiiit* edit: i'm gonna have to get back on k-h intransivity, [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fpl00004095) seems to be the only source for it edit2: the price mechanism only causes allocative efficiency when a market clears (dd=ss and every buyer pays up to the price they are willing and able to accept), and all externalities are internalized, and no barrier to entry exists such that any producer producing at a quantity that is less than efficient is forced to accept competitors with the same cost structure who are willing and able to supply a larger quantity to lower price. this doesn't happen very much. i mean, it happens, but in certain situations in different markets. the op is unjustifiably being downvoted for pointing out that information asymmetry distorts the market; here, uber and grab know the exact qd and have a good profile of prices the market willing and able to accept. now, if the issue were purely one of price discrimination then it's merely a problem of surplus transfer (i.e. semi-perfect pd) and not of inefficiency, but there's no way to tell. while game theory suggests that price-competing n-polies crumble because any equilibrium outside p=mc incentivizes a player to lower prices by *ϵ* to capture the market, the reality is that capacity constraints (artificial or natural) and search costs cause the market to be allocatively inefficient. the point of all this is to say that price signalling is, without perfect information about the market, a weak proof of efficiency - movement in a theoretical/classical market has clear price signals, but, conversely, a price movement tells you nothing about the allocative efficiency of a market. for example, the cost structure of a monopoly firm may change due to one-time government intervention. dwl worsens because of a larger quantity gap, but no such information is embedded in the price. asset bubbles, too, represent a class of price signals gone awry.",['denunciator'],19/09/2017,-3,mrt,Positive

"1) i don’t know if this is the appropriate terminology used in courtrooms but i do know there is a difference in degree and culpability in different outrage of modesty cases. there is for example, a difference in degree if a victim is touched on the thigh briefly vs the victim is being groped for an extended period of time. i know for most people, molest is molest, but the way the law works is that not all outrage of modesty cases are equal in degree; some are minor and some are major. sentencing has to reflect such differences. 2) appeal not to operate as stay of execution 41.—(1) an appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the decision appealed from unless the court below or the court of appeal so orders. the very fact that the judge welcomed an appeal speaks volumes about her desire for transparency and accountability. as judging from the code above, perhaps there is some legal ramifications between a stay of execution and an appeal that resulted in her decision(anyone trained in law are welcomed to help interpret this decision) 3) does it matter if anyone is surprised by the verdict? i know the law minister is also a lawyer, but i’m not too sure if he is acquainted with all the facts of the case. at the very least, the person most familiar with the case would be the judge herself, and we should let the appeal court review the case with the full facts. as in every case, there will always be people surprised and whatnot at the outcome. that does not mean that the judge has not gone through due process in delivering the sentence. 4) have you ever considered the fact that the judge could view him as repentant because the perp admitted to his crimes himself. admission of guilt are usually mitigating factors, especially in cases where they have no obligation to admit and could have stayed in the dark without anyone finding out. this coupled with probation, which probably included counselling and other help, could have convinced the judge that the perp was not only willing but also able to overcome his urges. 5) you are comparing 2 different case with very different perps. when i talk about precedence, i’m talking about young students who are adjudged to have a bright future ahead of them. remember nicholas lim? he was let off lightly by the police too. if you scrawl through the nus database, you would see that students who commit sexual crimes face less harsh punishments as opposed to other people. this problem has been here since time immemorial because our system views students in universities to have more rehabilitative potential than anyone on the street. this imo, is the true elephant in the box that should be addressed, not the indiscriminate bashing of judges based on emotive feelings.",['Bryanlegend'],27/09/2019,-4,mrt,Positive
"too many *lines*. for example, london isn't so bad because it's all the underground, so transferring is relatively painless if you follow the signs and know the layouts (and keep an eye out for downtime announcements). but there's the odd bits around where it's actually faster to tap out of the station and walk to another station servicing another line, instead of riding to an interchange. this doesn't hold a candle to tokyo and it's much praised trains, where you have *multiple companies* operating lines within the metropolitan area and the greater zone - so not only do you have to juggle several different tickets, you gotta keep track of the different lines run by the different companies and fight through the station crowds to make your connection. which will depart *precisely* on time, so you *know* for a fact when you're not gonna make your train, resulting in a knock-on effect where you end up missing all the different line changes that you may have to take and waiting accumulated minutes here and there. on that note, this is why japanese rail companies issue apologies when their trains depart too early or slightly late - because the transfer times between different lines are so tight that it's easy to miss a connection. like i said. it's a way different experience overseas. it's not about the number of lines or number of stations. it's the user experience taking these public transport systems.",['syanda'],22/08/2018,-5,mrt,Positive

"congratulations on passing. i will give you a few reasons why you should not rent a car just yet. 1. you only have 13 points to spare for 1 year. it's pretty easy to get demerit points nowadays. parking will likely catch you out, since you are a new driver. that's worth a few points on its own. not to mention the red light camera. they change from amber to red very quickly. you might not have the reaction time to deal with it. 2. cars are extremely expensive to fix. small dent, small scrape, it will cost you an arm and a leg back at the rental firm. when you rent a car, you have to be aware of all the damages on the car. it has to be photographed and written down. unless someone experienced goes with you to collect the car, chances are that you will miss things that will be used against you when you return the car. the salesman will gloss over the damage when you collect it, but make a big deal when you return the car. that's how it works, and you have to be aware of it. 3. most firms don't rent to p-plates. if they do, they require a higher deposit and higher insurance excess. it's not uncommon to hear of excess of 10k for a p-plate rental car. 4. if you do wanna rent, go for the bigger more established firms. they will be more upfront and honest in their dealings. their prices will definitely be higher. but you can be sure that they won't try to makan you on hidden damages. their cars tend to be newer / more well maintained. 5. driving on your own with a p-plate is unlike driving a car with a l-plate. most motorists don't give a shit if you are p-plate. they will cut your lane anyhowly or jam brake as they like. it's a very scary world out there. feel free to post any questions and i'm sure others will be willing to advice you.",['lizhien'],14/05/2018,9,car rental,Positive

"there are a lot of economic implications you haven't considered, that you may come to consider if you read thomas sowell's book on economics. let's take one example of increasing cleaner wages. let's say we pay cleaners 2k a month. do you really think all cleaners will now earn 2k a month? i can forsee that a lot of smes with low profit margins cutting back, perhaps hiring cleaners less often, or even doing the job themselves. for those that still require the same amount of cleaning, they will have a greater pool of employment pool to choose from. why employ an elderly, partially disabled, less efficient cleaner, over a healthy, younger, more efficient cleaner who can clean faster and better? after all, you're paying more, you should be entitled to hire a better cleaner right? your original aim was to help the low-income cleaners; usually the elderly, disabled or impaired, the 'uneducated'. you have instead replaced them with younger, healthier, more educated workers who would otherwise have contributed to the economy in more productive ways.' at the end of the day, the economy should be as efficient as possible to maximise productivity. of course, efficiency is not the same as 'fairness' or 'rightness', and the economy can often develop inefficiencies, and there is a role for government to intervene. workfare bonuses, for instance, allow low-income workers to be employed whilst receiving help from the government. taxing high-income brackets is generally regarded and accepted as a logical and effective way for wealth distribution. singapore has decided on a relatively low taxation system. should it increase taxation, perhaps the government can get more taxes to redistribute to the lower income....or it could also drive away investment and capital from singapore. if taxes go up, profits go down, so companies might choose to locate elsewhere, taking away jobs and income that would otherwise have flowed into singapore. is it fair that rich people have so much more money than the poor? probably not, but what if you decided to squeeze the rich to give to the poor? then the previously-rich will ask themselves 'whats the point of setting up businesses, doing all the work, etc when all the wealth is taken away from me? i might as well just be a cleaner, or migrate elsewhere where i can make and keep my money'. that is what happened to the soviet bloc, where incentives to innovate, to increase productivity and efficiency were annihilated, so much so that the average 'poor' person in america objectively had a better standard of living than the average 'middle class' soviet union citizen.",['junnies'],28/02/2019,37,bus,Positive

basically, almost every non-wheelchair accessible single deck sbs bus is a volvo b10m, apart from a few cng volvo b10bles found mostly in the west. 2) sbs transit's mercedes-benz o405s were also retired a few years back. theyy have different bodywork from their smrt counterparts and are also older, with different gearbox. i don't have much memories of them as an enthusiast though. they retired when i just entered the hobby, but i liked their front wheelarch because i could sit there and pretend to be the driver (was still a little kid then) 3) scania n113crb. they were already retired when i came into the hobby, so i have no memories of them. 4) dennis dart. they were the shortest public buses in singapore at time of retirement at 9.4m (standard buses are 12m). mostly found on services 92 and 42, though the 92 ones were retired early, while the ones on 42 served until the end of 17 years. from smrt - 1) mercedes-benz o405s. they're the characteristic boxy buses that you see on almost all smrt services. believe it or not as robust and as modern as they look and feel many of them are approaching 17, 18, 19 (the oldest) years old. their bendy variants are also getting retired. they're a bit younger at 17, but with the new double deckers coming in and lta's (and probably the public) stance towards bendies, they have not received any lifespan extension. 2) the scania l113crl, its retirement was quite recent in fact, just last week. they're the ""old looking"" buses that used to be found on routes 178, 187, 852, until their progressive retirement started this year. a different variant of the scania l113crl, the same chassis but a different bodywork, was retired in ~2012. probably the worst ever bus that smrt bought. they also used to be found often on 178/187/852 - they're the dusty, squeaky ""old looking"" buses and their aircon was crap. glad they're gone, but us bus enthusiasts used to chase them a lot because they mostly only appeared on 178/187/852, so any other service was quite the special occurrence. they're actually newer than all the o405s and they retired before their lifespan was up. most likely due to the horrible condition they were in. 3) the hino hs3krk and dennis lance. these were also retired early due to the poor condition of the buses - they were about 13~14, maybe 15, at the time of retirement. the hinos were the last japanese bus bought by smrt and were found around cck, the dennis lances were based at ang mo kio depot and served yishun. most buses that are retired end up in the scrapyard - most at kranji, a few at other places. some have been exported to other countries - the sbs transit mercedes-benz o405s have been refurbished, re-engined and rebodied and are now running as public buses in thailand. pics: leyland olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/22193-6/sbs9000s-51.jpg volvo olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/8732-6/800x600xvo3x-premium-shentonway.jpg.pagespeed.ic.l-sfbdpuly.jpg the volvo and leyland olympians are quite similar on the outside but there's a few notable differences, including engine type on the later volvos, the dashboard, lack of power steering for the leylands (made them very hard to steer) and 2 rear grilles on the leyland instead of 1 on the volvo. sbs transit mercedes-benz o405: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/622-10/sbs3798m-ct8.jpg sbs transit volvo b10ms: they came in several batches with different bodywork. all variants are going off now, some at 17 years and some at 19. http://www.sgbuses.com/d/47-10/sbs694z-99-sbs746h-96.jpg mark 3, retired in 2012 http://www.sgbuses.com/d/9670-6/sbs886l-39.jpg mark 4 duple metsec, majority retired, ~40 out of 115 left in service http://www.sgbuses.com/d/2633-8/sbs2631s-156.jpg mark 4 walter alexander strider. some are retired http://www.sgbuses.com/d/2977-8/sbs2795c-15.jpg mark 4 duple metsec dm3500. just started retirement sbs transit scania n113crb: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/334-10/sbs3692j-225.jpg all retired sbs transit dennis dart -

"> i didn't read 1984, but from cliff notes and snippets from school, i understand that it was told from the perspective of edward snowden/amos yee, as in someone who is very likely to stir shit. those that didn't stir shit lived pretty freely. the rat-phobic guy toured the chill people neighbourhood at some point and remarked how nice their lives were did he not? go read the book. orwell wasn't a shit-stirrer. he fought with the communist-aligned anti-fascists during the spanish civil war, then during the war he got seriously disillusioned with communism as well, and this shows in animal farm and 1984. my take of his writings is that he was highly critical of injustice and abuses of power regardless of the perpetrator's ideology. essentially, no matter how noble people claim their end-goals are, those who abuse power are all the same: oppressing others for self-gain. from 1984: > ""now i will tell you the answer to my question. it is this. the party seeks power entirely for its own sake. we are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. what pure power means you will understand presently. we are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. all the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. they pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. we are not like that. we know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. power is not a means; it is an end. one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. the object of persecution is persecution. the object of torture is torture. the object of power is power. now you begin to understand me.""",['MagosBiologis'],30/04/2018,29,bus,Positive

"well first off, it's kinda hard to get lost in singapore, considering we're such a tiny country. in part because our public transport system is generally excellent, at least in terms of accessibility and availability throughout the island. the bad news is that ntu's location is terribly isolated -- tucked in at the north-west of singapore. amongst the locals, we call it 'pulau ntu', which translates to 'ntu-island'. there's barely anything interesting in the immediate vicinity. traveling along won't be a problem at all. singapore is probably the safest country in all of asia for you to be doing that. all you need is either an ez-link card (buy it at any mrt (train) station, pre-load cash into it and tap it whenever you board a bus or enter a train station gantry), or if you wish to travel very often, a bus/mrt concession pass. if you're into pokémon go... well once you arrive, you can turn on the app and you'll see the super dense network of pokémon stops which you can probably only dream of in canada. other than that, i doubt you'll find much pokémon related stuff here (japan is where it's at), and i don't really have any other recommendations for 'nerdy-related' stuff. as is the general advice for most exchange students to singapore, try to schedule your timetable in a way that frees up either/both of your mondays or/and fridays. that allows you a long weekend to take short trips out of singapore where you'll find plenty of other stuff to do that you cannot find otherwise in singapore. enjoy your exchange experience in ntu/ singapore!",['gyxorz'],03/01/2017,25,bus,Positive

"1984 was written from the pov of winston smith, a member of the middle-class working for the ministry of truth (and ostensibly the party). he's an average joe, far from being a shit-stirrer like yee. the only crime he committed was to question the truth behind the historical revisionism he helped perpetuate at work. and while he was hesitant at first, even paranoid of being found out, he was emboldened by o'brien (someone whom he believed to be part of the resistance movement), emboldened to denounce the party publicly. ironically, there was never a resistance, and o'brien was just part of a false flag by the thought police to root out any dissidents. so, was smith a shit-stirrer? perhaps he could be seen as one, considering how he went about denouncing the party and big brother. but he was just an average person that managed to look past the lies and saw the injustice and abuse of power by the party. yes, he is in a way similar to snowden, but i would disagree with putting smith on the same pedestal as yee. snowden was in many ways similar to smith, in that they both worked for government agencies that were abusing the trust and authority given to them by the people, they came out with the truth, and were subsequently hunted and shut down by their governments. yee on the other hand is simply a rambling idiot, one that does nothing but evoke a sense of pity. he thinks himself a martyr, but hides behind the comfort and security of the net while attempting to stir shit with his ""i am smarter than everyone else"" rhetoric. tbh, to say that smith is a shit-stirrer would be grossly inaccurate, as this would be labelling all whistle-blowers under the same banner. we need whistle-blowers to expose faults in organisations, be it governmental or corporate bodies. without them, there would be no rammifications against the abuse of power. 1984 is also a warning about the potential for abuse a police state can bring about. the people live in constant fear of becoming unpersons. even model citizens can become public enemy #1 if a single word can be miscontrued as dissent. power and luxuries are held only by a select few, with everyone else living in poverty. truth can become lies overnight. you never know when the government boogeymen will come for you. if that's the price for a ""safe"" living, then what's the point? with the increasing number of people advocating a totalitarian state without addressing the key issues behind the implementation of such ideologies, i worry for the future of this country.",['potatetoe_tractor'],30/04/2018,23,bus,Positive

"local brown person here, i love writing long stories :) - singapore is a cultural paradox. it is a country of so many immigrants, and now it's experiencing a new wave of immigrants - realistically speaking, it's very impressive for the number of different cultures/races/ethnicities all squashed together on our tiny, red dot to still exist in peace and harmony. the last thing singaporeans want is a clash of cultures - we had riots in the 60s and nobody wants that to happen again. so we try our best to live in harmony, even if we don't like our neighbour, we keep our thoughts to ourself and smile and carry on. the crazy influx of immigrants starting in the 80s has built up a sort of apprehension towards foreigners in general. then we start lumping the foreigners into groups: some groups are more tolerated and welcome than others. reality shows that india-indians and china-chinese are among the not-so-liked at the moment. but do remember, back in the 80s, hongkongers were despised, because there was a large exodus before hk went back under chinese rule. one prevalent aspect of 'local' culture is to be always (somewhat) tolerant of your noisy/smelly fellow local neighbour. racial harmony is always so very hammered into our heads in school - so most of us know how to behave even if our true feelings aren't that nice. the sudden shock of the more recent influx of immigrants, not just from china and india, has thrust a huge wave of new behaviours and habits upon us. suddenly, it's okay to push and shove on the bus, or talk so loudly, or gather in ridiculously large numbers and block the sidewalk, stare at local girls like they've never seen a girl before, be generally obnoxious.... (i realize these are stereotyped behaviours, but it's what people tend to see.) then it becomes a case of them vs. us. and singapore's small size and limited resources means that this is a harsh reality - good schools, places to live, are all up for grabs. if someone shoves you on the bus, it's bad enough, but if that person happens to be an immigrant (and even worse, a rude one who doesn't apologize or see the error in their way) the local dude is going to think ""goddamn immigrant taking up my space, shoving me on my bus. you can push in your country, but here we wait our turn."" not the best, but humans are entitled to their emotions and stakes are high on public transit. same goes for the few indian families that may have trashed some rental properties - once bitten, twice shy. it is just a clash of cultures, and i do believe locals feel that immigrants are the ones that need to take that extra step to meet us, since we accepted you into our turf. it's not that we don't like you, but logically, if you come here, than you have to change some things, not us. you have to be culturally-sensitive towards us, if you would like the same in return. if it is a huge issue, then get involved in politics and try to change the laws - it's been done. fun anecdote - when i was growing up in the 90s, we had an indian family move into next door. boy were they stuck up as hell! never smiled/said hello, etc. my mum tried to chat and was met with curt responses. pretty much slammed the door in her face while she was saying ""have a nice day."" the kid went to the same school as me, and he was a little snotty brat. so there - image ruined. if you consider yourself a nice immigrant, you have people like these to thank for ruining it for all of you. local indians are also often looked down by these immigrants who bring their caste system with them - that lady asked my mum what caste we were (my family is mostly tamil, but several generations in singapore has given us some mixed blood), and then gave a look of disgust when my mum said we don't observe castes here. this has happened numerous times with indian expats. hell, i live in canada now, and i've been asked by indian immigrants what my caste is. srsly??? (i feel like telling them to go back to india!) the same can be said for people from china. stereotypically, they are greedy and rude. they are the ones cutting in line and ruining your day. perhaps, but there are also nice ones. well, i'm rambling. but my point is, (and as an immigrant in another country myself), i can guarantee you that if you take the initiative to make the first step, to build that bridge, life will get better. the reality is you have to prove yourself. don't distance yourself from the stereotypes - instead forward-thinking people like you could be thinking of ways to integrate better. why do those stereotypes exist? if there are douches buying up swaths of property, driving up prices, then that douche is exploiting the system and depriving locals (and honest immigrants) of a decent living. and it happens so often, it becomes a trademark of that immigrant group. they are making you look bad, so maybe you can do something about it? blaming the locals isn't going to help, even if they are a tad belligerent. if you formed a club that educated your fellow indians on local customs, and how not to ask what caste local indians belong too, or how not to talk extremely loudly in public places, then you would have made a difference. if a chinese that shares the same sentiments as you makes an effort to educate his fellow countrymen on how pushing and shoving on the train and coughing without covering your mouth is rude, then we locals will thank him. besides, there is a good number of immigrants (from all over) who are in singapore just to milk it. so there is no respect, there is no love, it's just a grab-all-you-can-fest. if the locals are slow and polite, then they are suckers..... there's that sentiment too. you may not feel that way, but there are several who do. so maybe you can help change that feeling. you are well-educated and liberal. why don't you write to the paper, or any of the publications geared toward immigrants on how to better integrate? and don't take it too personally when you get told ""no indians"" when trying to rent. local indians (i'm 4th generation singaporean, don't even quite know my indian ancestors), get the same rule applied (sometimes). and think of it this way - you probably don't want to live in a place where the landlord is a douchey racist, right?",['level3elf'],18/10/2012,22,bus,Positive

"food $4-5 is more than enough for a meal at a hawker center. plenty of hawker centers even in the central business district. about $8 will get you a meal at an air-conditioned food court. restaurants, bistros and cafes start at $10 and can go up to the sky as singapore is home to some very expensive dining options. note that prices at most restaurants and bistros are exclusive of goods and services tax (consumption tax, 7%) and service charges (10%) - look out for the ++ sign or fine print. groceries are cheap at local supermarkets, but the quality of groceries here is not as high as the typical japanese or american supermarkets. some examples of prices are: $2.50 for 5 china fuji apples, less than $1 for a clump of enoki mushrooms, about $5 for a bag of instant coffee packets. the large expat community here means there are specialty supermarkets that cater to them. some bigger ones include [marketplace by jason's](http://www.marketplacebyjasons.com/mpjshop/en/html/index.html) and the japanese supermarket meidi-ya. prices are higher at specialty supermarkets. transport if you aren't owning a car, singapore has one of the cheapest public transport systems among big cities in developed countries. bus, train, and light rail share a distance fare system where the final cost of a trip is charged based on distance traveled, regardless of number of transfers taken. a trip from the suburbs into the city will usually cost no more than $2. taxis are also relatively cheap, starting at about less than $4 for most types of taxis. trips are all metered and drivers stick strictly to the meter (no need to bargain) and there is no tipping culture. there is an arcane system of surcharges that you have to take note of, the major ones being the peak hour surcharge (25% of metered fare) and midnight surcharge (50% of metered fare). there is often no need to book a taxi because they are plentiful. you can find out more here: http://www.taxisingapore.com/taxi-fare/ phone prepaid cards are cheap and have 6 month durations before you need to top up the card. they start at $5 (with an initial sim card fee) and can be topped up at various values, the most common being an $18 card. mobile internet packages are available for prepaid subscribers, coming at 100mb packages to 3gb packages with varying durations. money is taken from the stored-value card and there are no hidden fees. an example of a package for a heavy user is a 3gb package that lasts for 50 days costing $30, to give you an idea of how much it costs. you can get more information from the websites of the three main mobile carriers in singapore - m1, starhub, and singtel. m1 and starhub are probably more relevant because they have the most comprehensive prepaid plans. if you are here for an extended period of time (2 years+), consider a contract because they are relatively cheap. entertainment $10+ for a movie ticket. video games are a mixed bag because we have asian versions, but are generally more expensive than in the us because we do not have mega retailers like amazon. plenty of concerts, plays, recitals, musicals etc. that start as cheap as free with world-class acts coming in every now and then. tourist attractions are extremely expensive. the zoos here cost almost $40 for entrance, a one day pass at universal studios singapore costs $74, taking a ride on the singapore flyer costs over $20. not to say there aren't cheap attractions in singapore - museums are quite cheap, and there are places off the beaten track like pulau ubin that costs $2.50 for a one-way bumboat ride that features some diverse ecosystems and a glimpse at old singapore. $30++ for a night of clubbing, alcohol is extremely expensive here ($2.50+ for 330ml of semi-decent beer at the supermarket, the same 330ml turns into $6 at restaurants, drinks at clubs start at $6 and go all the way up).",['serados'],13/03/2014,13,bus,Positive

"might be getting downvotes for unpopular majority perspective, but do understand the point of why we are going cashless because it will increase productivity in the long run. firstly, businesses can reduce the man hours to count money. if you have been cashier, you will know you need to count money at the end of the day, making sure it tallies with the pos, before you can close the account. then you got to ensure your float has the sufficient notes. heck, those procedures are cumbersome for the employees, but not visible to customers. secondly, it reduces the likelihood of fraud. it also reduces the costs to set up security mechanisms to protect cheating. imagine flag day donations goes by digital than using the tin. then for customers, if you lost your wallet, say byebye to your cash. if you lose your cards, you can always report to the bank asap, and the one who picked up your card can't do shit. then there's mobile payments whereby you only require a phone with battery and data to make payments. thirdly, banks/authorities will incur lower costs to print money, maintain atms and transportation of money. making it go digital will reduce the costs and we will have job losses (security guard, less need for so many cashiers). ideally, cashless transactions should not impose any transaction fees to customers or business considering that we save on other costs. it will be ideal if nets can reduce their fees to merchants. i'm thinking of the impact of how cashless will affect the tradition of red packets. issuing qr code vouchers that once scanned will go into your account??? 😂😂😂 or simply scanning qr codes via mobile phones???",['lilfoot0'],12/08/2017,12,bus,Positive

"comfort merely acquired part of the rental car business, which uber had to set up specifically for uber drivers to overcome the high prices here. thats a definite win for uber imho, they get a boatload of cash and they amazingly found someone to actually take partial ownership of their rental fleet and bear part of the risk of low demand and obselecence. arguably the most troublesome part of their ops in singapore. if this wasnt enough all the uber drivers renting the car from there still use the uber app, plus comfort is still nice enough to drive even more traffic to them in the form of cab drivers. what a deal. controlling the rental car business with 51% isnt even leverage, its just cars- uber can set it up all over again should it need to without comfort, and their users will have to jump over. in fact that leaves comfort with a shit load of empty vehicles which it then has to offload or idle (sounds familar?), which means uber has more command over the fleet in reality.",['csixinewkc'],08/12/2017,10,bus,Positive

"the role that mahbubani is playing now was played in the past, too: being a pundit calling for hard nationalization so that the government can present its own approach as a pragmatic compromise, and those who have to accept losses accept it as a fait accompli there is a tendency for pap *and* opposition revisionism to exaggerate just how strong the government position was in the mid 1970s. at that point there was no multidecade track record of staggering economic prosperity and stability. instead, there were many observers and politicians (within the pap itself, which at this point held the entire parliament) who, like mahbubani today, called for nationalization. so the government could effectively say: look, you are making such a mess of this that if we took away your licenses, nobody would support you. now hand over your company for 'restructuring'. without the widespread calls for nationalization, i don't think the pap could have did the-thing-that-was-not-nationalization. on the other hand, by maintaining that it was *not* going to nationalize sbs, it could maintain its favoured solution of operating it as a profit-making concern, rather than being trapped by fearsome bus fare politics. remember that it was only in 1975 that the government had finally smashed the university student unions - one of tan wah piow's largest protests was over bus fare hikes in 1974. he only fled singapore in 1976.",['threesls'],29/10/2015,10,bus,Negative

"peak hour is a function of user behavior, and is not something that arises from a common definition of ""public transport"". unlike mrts and a lesser extent buses (who get bus lanes), taxis share the road with private cars, and so the taxi peak hour is more related to peak hour for private cars. if i had to guess - taxi (and car users) experience slightly delayed peak hour compared to mrt/buses because taxi and car users anticipate a shorter journey as compared to using public transport. so everyone sets out later.",['pingmr'],09/10/2019,9,bus,Positive
"for anyone who is going for any kpop events organized by ime in the future. --- on 5/8/2017, my sister queued up at alexandra post office from 8am to purchase 4 vip tickets for seventeen diamond edge in singapore. ticket sales started at 12pm, and the counter service at apo managed to secure the 4 vip tickets, and charged us exactly $1248.00. however, for some unbelievable reason, he didn't manage to get them to print!!!! why??? nobody has a clue. so they had already taken our 1k+, but we didn't get our tickets. understandably infuriated, i called apactix and singpost to question: why couldn't the counter service officer do a simple and frankly elementary level skill of printing 4 tickets? i was then advised to send them an email including the receipt and our apactix account number and they would get back to me. a week later, apactix's customer service officer cien contacted my sister, and told me this, in their words: ""we will refund you the tickets in full, and give you 4 cat 1 tickets, as all the vip tickets are out of stock."" i double-checked with her, in my words: ""you will refund all $1248, and give me the cat 1 tickets? so essentially i don't have to pay anything?"" she replied, ""yes. can i have your address so that i can mail you the tickets?"" i gave her my address and forgave them for their mistake. after all, it was an honest mistake. fast forward 2 weeks later: no tickets have appeared. i'm confused; you told me that you would mail them, and then i don't see any tickets in my mailbox? so i facebook-messaged apactix, at which they replied that they would get in contact with my sister. turns out that the tickets got lost in mail! apactix did not give me the option to choose what sort of mailing (keep in mind, these tickets are worth in total $992, they literally sent almost $1k worth of goods in normal mail). so they told my sister that she could go down to collect the tickets at sportshub, which we were fine about. she went down to collect the tickets on 5/9/2017 at sportshub, got terribly lost for an hour, but yay she finally got our tickets! and so we thought the saga was over. but it wasn't. today, 6/9/2017, my sister received a call from apactix. she was very confused, and passed the phone to me. they told me, to my ears, without any joking spirit at all: ""the cat 1 tickets you have are of paid value, and you will have to pay us the $992+ (incl booking fee)."" when i heard that, i almost started laughing. so firstly: your customer service officer told me, with her own words written above, that the tickets would not be charged to me. secondly, you had two weeks to get back to me about this, for not only 1 mistake, but multiple mistakes. and now i'm expected to pay? i asked to speak to the manager, clarence. who then proceeded to tell me, with his own words: ""this was an honest mistake from my staff, and i apologise, but you will have to pay in full. if not you have the choice to cancel the tickets."" i replied him: ""clarence, frankly, is your sorry worth $1000?"" he could not reply me. so let me repeat this story: 1. you don't educate the staff who are selling your tickets on how to utilize the system, leading to me losing out on the tickets that i wanted. 2. your customer service officer tells me, which i confirmed twice with her, that i will be refunded in full, followed by being given 4 cat 1 tickets without any extra charge. 3. you send my tickets worth well over $900 in normal mail, without giving me the option to choose what sort of mail i want, despite the tickets being worth almost the amount of a diamond, thus losing my tickets. 4. you wait 2 weeks to tell me that i am expected to pay in full for tickets that i was given as a concession for not being able to get my vip tickets. 5. you don't even offer me anything, except a few simple words of ""sorry, my staff made a mistake"". and you tell me i can just simply cancel my tickets, even though i've waited months for this concert. appalling, really. as i reiterated to your customer service manager, your line is nothing. when people in hospitals make mistakes, it costs lives. they pay hefty amounts of money to the people who've lost family members. and you? you can't even give me a good reason. rest assured, i will be filing a report with case. i sincerely hope no one else has to deal with this business again. --- (posted on apactix facebook) my real life account of what happened with apactix, and ime, who til today have not responded to any of my queries. do not support these people!!!!! they care absolutely nothing about customer satisfaction; it's almost comical to see how terrible they are at their jobs.",['Peanutswithcream'],07/09/2017,9,bus,Positive

"more singapore children are being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (asd) each year, with demand for places in schools for them going up as well. in the past five years, public hospitals reported an annual increase of about 15 per cent of autism cases among children aged up to six years. the steady rise is due to parents, who are now better educated, being more aware of the condition and improvements in the diagnosis process, said experts interviewed. there is better overall developmental surveillance and screening of children, and milder forms of autism are now more readily diagnosed, a health ministry spokes-man told the straits times (st). in tandem with the uptrend is a growing demand for places in autism-focused schools. at least two will be expanding: pathlight and eden. pathlight school, for high-functioning children with autism, said last month that a second campus will be built in tampines. scheduled to open in 2023, it will provide 500 primary-level places. it will augment the 1,456 primary and secondary places at its main and interim campuses, both of which are in ang mo kio. &#x200b; * 15% * approximate annual increase of autism cases among children aged up to six years reported at public hospitals in the past five years. enrolment has risen steadily since it opened in 2004 with 41 students, its principal linda kho told st. in the past three years, year-on-year enrolment has risen by 10 per cent to 15 per cent, she added. similarly, eden school in bukit batok, for students aged seven to 18 with moderate to severe autism, is building a second campus in the same area. it will be ready in january 2021, with 300 to 350 places. eden is also holding extra classes at an interim campus in ang mo kio, said its vice-principal patricia cheng. its enrolment has jumped 12 per cent from 315 in march 2016 to 353 in march 2019. st andrew's autism school, for students aged seven to 18 with moderate to severe autism, has seen enrolment surge up to 13 per cent year on year since 2016. it currently has 287 students and hopes to reach 312 next year. 📷 related story #### [housewife chats better with son after 'kopi sessions'](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housewife-chats-better-with-son-after-kopi-sessions) related story #### [tech improves lives of kids with autism, helps them learn](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/tech-improves-lives-of-kids-with-autism-helps-them-learn) related story #### [once picked on and misunderstood, lab assistant finds a way](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/once-picked-on-and-misunderstood-lab-assistant-finds-a-way) the rising enrolment of children with autism is also apparent in mainstream education settings, such as kindergartens and national schools, said mrs julia teo, deputy director of busy bees asia, which runs bright path preschool for children with different learning needs. one reason is the wider spectrum of learning needs and abilities, which increases the likelihood of children being diagnosed with added learning needs, said mrs teo, who has more than 30 years of experience in early childhood education. other reasons include greater awareness of the benefits of inclusive education and access to greater support in the early childhood and special education sector, she added. dr eyleen goh, principal investigator at the national neuroscience institute, noted that increased awareness and improved diagnosis are part and parcel of being a developed nation, with most people being better-educated and receiving good healthcare services.

"> # epicentre acting ceo uncontactable; former apple reseller gets statutory demands from creditors > singapore - epicentre holdings executive chairman and acting chief executive officer kenneth lim tiong hian has been uncontactable since may 24, the catalist-listed former apple reseller announced on thursday afternoon (may 30), following its request for a trading suspension that morning. > epicentre said it will not be proceeding with a proposed placement of up to about 79.7 million new ordinary shares in its capital, saying that mr lim, ""who has been key and instrumental to the proposed placement"", has been uncontactable. it noted that it does not have any monies held in escrow. > ""in order to repay the existing liabilities of the company, the company is currently trying to come up with a workout plan to facilitate repayment to creditors,"" said epicentre. > having received statutory demands dated may 21 and may 27 from three creditors, epicentre ""is seeking legal advice and assessing the potential impact on the group"". ""this potentially raises issues in terms of the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it added. > ""in the absence of mr lim, the company remains under the leadership of the independent directors, who are considering all possible options in the best interests of the company,"" said epicentre. > separately, an independent review of epicentre holdings' fy2017 accounts has found ""governance and internal control issues"" regarding consultancy services agreements and a supply agreement in which mr lim was involved, as well as a breach of internal policy relating to a s$1.76 million loan, which might have amounted to breaches of listing rules. > after market close on may 30, epicentre provided an executive summary of the findings, noting that they were unrelated to the voluntary suspension of trading that day. ""the company has since taken steps to improve its internal controls and will keep shareholders updated on this via a further announcement in due course,"" it said. > related story resellers reeling from tech giant apple's expansion in singapore > on oct 9, 2017, epicentre announced that its auditor bdo had withheld its opinion on several matters in the company's fy2017 accounts, noting that it had not been given ""sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the veracity of the purported transactions"". > epicentre appointed deloitte & touche llp to conduct an independent review. the accumulative net impact of the transactions reviewed, as at oct 9, 2018, was an increase in cash holdings by s$4.21 million and a net income gain of s$3.9 million. > one area of review were three agreements under which epicentre provided consultancy services: one s$1.4 million contract with lavita (thailand) co, later raised to s$1.45 million; and two contracts with kt pacific group for a total value of s$2.5 million. > both firms were ""personal contacts"" of mr lim. the review noted a sy meng meng who is a director of kt pacific and son of its controlling shareholder, and also held a 6.42 per cent stake in epicentre as at oct 2, 2017. > deloitte & touche said there ""have clearly been governance and internal control issues"" regarding these agreements. it noted that epicentre's core business was in running it retail outlets, and providing consultancy advisory was not part of its ordinary business. > there was no record that management had consulted the board of directors before executing the agreements, and no board resolutions passed. ""the materiality of these agreements and the breach of internal controls suggests that, in this regard, the company did not have a robust and effective system of internal controls and therefore may not have met the requirements of listing rule 719,"" said deloitte & touche. > it added that given the materiality of the agreements, epicentre should have announced them in line with catalist disclosure rules, with the failure to do so potentially amounting to a breach of listing rule 703. > deloitte & touche also said the flow of funds was ""unusual and has not been fully evidenced in terms of primary documents"". it recommended that management review and enhance its policies on credit and material transactions, and ensure adherence to these policies. > a second area of review was a supply agreement with shenzhen blueway technologies co, for an original contract value of s$5.33 million with a discount of s$888,000 if epicentre made an advance payment of s$4.44 million. > the advance was paid into two escrow agents, one of which was beneficially owned by epicentre shareholder leow kok meng and the other by mr lim. the escrow agents, mr leow, and mr lim also issued a performance guarantee for the benefit of epicentre. > here, deloitte & touche also found ""governance issues and internal control issues"". the conduct of the supply agreement was ""irregular and unusual"" as epicentre's funds were transmitted via mr lim and a shareholder. > when the agreement and performance guarantee were established and funds remitted, management should have disclosed the terms of the agreement and the involvement of mr lim to the board. ""there should also have been a discussion with the catalist sponsor on whether this constituted an interested person transaction, and if the appropriate disclosure should have been made,"" said deloitte & touche. > the failure to obtain board approval was a breach of internal policy and controls, and also suggests that epicentre may not have met the requirements of listing rule 719. deloitte & touche said management should set up internal procedures and guidelines on provision of advances to suppliers. > the third and final area of review was a s$1.76 million bridging loan taken on sept 7, 2016 from encore investment group, with a contracted interest rate of 24 per cent per annum, in order to meet payment obligations to apple. on oct 27 that year, epicentre entered a novation agreement to novate the loan to mr lim, with the only change being that the loan was now interest free. > deloitte & touche said it was advised by management that encore is beneficially owned by wong kum yong, who held an 8.03 per cent stake in epicentre as at oct 2, 2017. there was no formal consultation with the board prior to the loan's execution, amounting to a breach of internal policy and suggesting that epicentre may not have been in line with listing rule 719. > ""management should have disclosed the encore loan and the novation to the board of directors, and the novation should have been discussed with the catalist sponsor on whether this constituted an interested person transaction,"" said the review. > deloitte & touche said it had not seen disclosure of the loan from mr lim, nor the payments of the loan, in results announcements for the period ended dec 31, 2016 and june 30, 2017.

"full time grab veteran here. there is absolutely good money still to be made, under certain conditions at least. the biggest one being the often-overlooked one, are you okay with driving a lot. drive to kl non-stop, spend half an hour at a hawker center, drive back. nine hours in the car, does that sound like a lot? because to me, that's tuesday. wednesday, time to do it again... &#x200b; as far as the money goes, i drive a total of about fifty hours a week. which is less than you'd think honestly, because i don't have a commute sucking up time before/after work, and it's potentially spread across seven days, not five. after all car expenses are paid for, i pocket about $1k a week (and of course i get a car to drive, how valuable is that perk to you personally?). imo, the people who can't make that much are doing one of two things wrong. the first/obvious one being driving a car that has crappy fuel mileage. if you're driving for hire full time, most cars have crappy mileage (kilometerage?). grab's two most popular rental cars use less than 7l/100km. if your car uses 10+, that's a lot of money spent wasting fuel. at 10l/100km you're spending over $100 more per week on fuel than i am. is your current car worth spending an extra $400+ a month on? use the right tool for the job. &#x200b; the larger thing that people get wrong (in the sense of ""making less money per hour"") is driving too many lower-income hours. the middle of the day is slow, so working from 7-7 isn't going to get you $30+ an hour. the best times are weekends, like 10am to 11pm (a couple weeks ago i drove seven hours on sunday and got $290 in fares). during the week, the best times are 5:30 -10:30pm. mornings not quite so much so, you got the double whammy of bad traffic, and high downtime whenever you have to drive from downtown to a suburb without a passenger. also it's only busy for about two hours, 7:30-9:30, goes down fast after that. the rest of the hours of the day are well, the rest. so the key to making good money is to get a lot of those hours i listed. seven hours on weekdays (bit more on friday), fourteen on saturday, twelve on sunday. how many of those 62 hours are you willing to work? this isn't a 9-5 job where you hang with your buddies on the evenings. evenings and weekends is where the money's at. if you work a six day week, your day off is monday. &#x200b; as far as the incentives go, well yeah grab just lowered things a bit. that said, they used to adjust the incentives every single week. and in truth, it doesn't matter that much. i mean sure you want to optimize the bonuses when practical, but the incentives are mostly just there to encourage certain hours more than others. and in the long term, the average hourly rate has stayed remarkably constant. early on, when fares were super cheap to attract new customers, and there was a lot of downtime, incentives were higher to compensate. when lta screwed up the rollout of the pdvl license, and a lot of drivers got forcibly sidelined, there were surges all the time, and drivers did made more money despite the incentives going down. when grab absorbed uber drivers over the course of two weeks, the price plummeted (despite the conventional opinion, the uber merger made grab far cheaper). but but, you say, weren't prices rising in april and may? yeah, but grab took in the uber drivers back in early march, it only got into the press because of lta in april. and what was happening in april? after seeing a month solid of lower fares, drivers started leaving. a process that accelerated in april and may, then stopped by the end of june, with income having returned to... the same place it was the summer of the previous year. so if grab lowers the incentive too much, some drivers will quit, and surge will go up until income returns to the long-term average. &#x200b; tl;dr: drive the right hours in the right car, make $1k+ a week, learn to eat late dinners.",['mukansamonkey'],10/07/2019,8,bus,Positive

"what sort of incoming policy change do you have in mind? since 2011 (or 2010, give or take), the government's transport policy has shifted quite significantly from the model in the 90s and 00s: * clawing back route management from bus operators * more competitive bus route tendering * owning rail infrastructure and rolling stock * limiting the length of rail and bus operating licenses take the two most recent mrt projects: the circle line (completed '09-'12) and the downtown line ('13-'17). the circle line is operated by smrt. maintenance of operating assets like signalling are smrt's responsibility, as is the [purchase of rolling stock](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/deadlock-over-smrts-shift-to-new-rail-financing-framework). smrt's operating contract is for 30 years: if they are found to be inefficient or otherwise bad managers of the network, lta has to wait out this contract. the downtown line comes after the [new rail framework](http://www.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/press/2011/sbs%20transit%20limited%20to%20operate%20downtown%20line.pdf) was adopted in 2010. lta now owns not just the tracks, but the trains and the signalling systems. these are leased out to sbs (who pays lta ~$2bn) over the duration of their 15 year contract. a lot of this has been influenced by practices elsewhere; you could make a similar case for buses to the one for trains i made above. in fact, the bus contracting model is explicitly patterned on tfl's in london, where a 90s privatisation initially led to declining service and public complaints (sound familiar?), although london is by no means the only city that does this. i would suggest that these steps *are* moves away from the 90s/00s model of privatisation without a full retreat into complete nationalisation. of course they will take time to become evident—all the other mrt lines are still on the old framework, while the first bus contract doesn't begin until 2016—but i think in due course you will find official policy statements arguing that the new financing framework is superior to both the previous arrangement, and full-scale nationalisation. edit: lta's post 2011 moves like the bsep (buying 900 buses) and purchases of trains even for lines not covered by the new framework are also steps in the same direction",['kelsokelsokelsokelso'],29/10/2015,6,bus,Positive

seatbelts were taken into consideration for his sentencing. > just prior to the accident, yap was about to turn at a junction at commonwealth avenue west and clementi road. he had attempted to make a right turn into clementi road despite seeing a car coming at a high speed towards him in the opposite direction. > nus undergraduate kathy ong kai ting was seated at the rear left of yap's taxi along with two other men, ting jun heng, who was beside her, and lim jin jie, who was at the rear right of the taxi. > another man, zon lim thou jung, was seated at the front passenger seat of the taxi. the three men were 22 years old. > the group was heading back to a nus residential college, tembusu college, when they were involved in the accident. > video footage of the accident last year made its rounds online. > the court heard that on the night of 19 april last year, yap picked up the four passengers from clementi mall. yap did not ensure that his rear passengers were wearing their seat-belts before moving off. > yap then drove along commonwealth avenue west towards commonwealth avenue on the rightmost lane. upon reaching the signalised cross junction of commonwealth avenue west by clementi road, yap stopped at the red traffic light. when the traffic light signal turned green, but before the green right turn arrow lit up, yap drove into the right turn pocket. > he stopped and checked for vehicles coming from the opposite direction. even though he saw a car coming towards him from the opposite direction at a high speed, he decided to do a right turn. > the 21-year-old car driver, ng li ning, who had the right of way, was unable to avoid the taxi and the two vehicles collided. a health sciences authority report later found that ng was travelling at a speed of 92 kmh to 97 kmh on a road with a speed limit of 70kmh. the same report also found that had ng's car been travelling within the speed limit, a collision would likely have been avoidable. > both cars spun and were severely damaged, said deputy public prosecutor timotheus koh. the taxi also hit another car which was stationary at the signalised junction. > all the passengers were conveyed to national university hospital where ong was pronounced dead at 10.25pm. > zon lim suffered from multiple facial lacerations, bruises and glass in his wounds. > lim jin jie received bruises and a fracture to his spine. > ting had a traumatic brain injury, and became vegetative initially but his condition has since improved. he suffered multiple injuries to his ribs, lung, left kidney and pelvic bone, and was dependent on a ventilator. he is still undergoing rehabilitation. > dpp koh sought eight weeks' jail for yap and a disqualification from driving for five years. > the accident claimed ong’s life and inflicted serious lasting injuries to three others, said the prosecutor. the accused was “aware of the danger approaching but decided to run the risk anyway”, he added. > yap was fined for several traffic offences up to 2016, including failing to conform to red light signal on three occasions, careless driving and speeding, according to the prosecutor. > josephus tan, yap’s lawyer, asked for six weeks' jail but agreed with the prosecution on the disqualification period. > the lawyer from invictus law pointed out that tan had first checked for oncoming traffic. > ""this is in stark contrast to the typical dangerous driving or even careless driving cases whereby the offender simply proceeds to drive through the junction without a single stop whatsoever,"" said tan. > referring to the hsa report, tan pointed out that the accident might have been avoidable if ng had been travelling within the speed limit. > yahoo news singapore understands that action will be taken against ng. >

"1) the 3 weeks visa (more or less) is nearly a non-issue. you can always extend, or waltz into malaysia and back again like normal singaporeans going to malaysia on the weekend if you wanna stay a little longer. however, if there's a need (eg parents sick etc etc), there are [longer term visas](https://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/topics/pages/mobile/topicsdetail.aspx?mpageid=197) . 2) to be honest, my most racist experience was actually during my trip in singapore to renounce my citizenship (lol). but this is a deep question and i will try my best to respond. racism is a human construct, that's the most basic thing to remember. for people to see and feel the differences, they are not the smartest, flexible and sociable creatures to be with anyways. so why bother with them? people will always have some sort of bias, even in singapore, so we can learn to deal with it or don't. i mean, let's face it. singaporeans now have an anti prc, anti foreigner mentality. that's a form of bias in itself. just because it's us vs them doesn't mean we aren't racist in singapore. way back when i was growing up, it was either indians are stupid or malays are thieves, right? to get offended is both a choice and a weapon. in australia, at least, there are laws protecting people from racism, and equal amounts of people protecting others from racism. if you choose to be offended, you will not be alone and people will help you, some times for the most ridiculous reasons and extent. eg i know a korean person who was quite abusive to both her clients (who are dependent on her) and colleagues. but when she was reported to authorities, she got let go with ""cultural differences"". but also, perhaps it's time for a reflection on yourself. growing up, i was not comfortable being chinese. never cared about my roots, didn't care to learn more. after i came here and meeting so many people from all walks of life, i learnt to appreciate my difference and cultural history more. australians take themselves very lightly, while still very much in love with being an australian, and i think i have turned out the same. i can joke about being chinese, being squinty eyed, but i genuinely appreciate it enough to go back and study mandarin (lmao, it suffered) and read chinese history. it takes a lot to offend/humiliate me these days, and if there's any racist connotations these days, i either try to educate or walk away depending on the situation. 3) the real question is ""why would you give up your red passport"" right? then the question is ""what's holding you back?"" for me, - i don't go back to singapore often enough. these days, i am probably more tourists than tourists are. i didn't even know what a singapore flyer was till a cabbie pointed it out lol. and i am never returning full time. - half the places singapore passports have privileges with, i don't even visit. - i haven't had the right to vote since a decade before i renounce. because i haven't stayed in singapore for the right amount of time. that said, my knowledge of politics in both country is about the same. - i am never buying a flat in singapore - my cpf in australia has way more money than my cpf in singapore. - there's more opportunities here than in singapore for me. - my life is here now. i still have friends and family in singapore, yes, but i am more familiar with australia than i am in singapore. it's not just about friends and family, but what i am entitled to and what i can do. (legalities, work, etc) - i have even more opportunities if i turn into a citizen in australia. but people differ. some people genuinely think they will return after a while (i know friends who go back to singapore after a decade of living overseas). others think they have more benefits being foreigners for some odd reason (aunt has been a pr for 20 years). so, it depends on your wants and needs.",['pewlapew'],21/03/2017,5,bus,Positive

> the issue of discretionary right turns also recently received an airing in parliament, with two members of parliament calling for their removal. > such junctions are projected to be discontinued in five years, but one mp, lim sun sun, urged the land transport authority to shorten the time to prevent more accidents. > for causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, yap could be jailed up to two years, fined, or both. > for causing grievous hurt by a negligent act, he could be jailed up to two years, fined up to s$5,000, or both. he could also face a driving ban. > what happened > the court heard that yap picked up his four passengers at clementi mall on april 19 last year at about 7.30pm. they then set off for tembusu college, a residential hostel in nus. > mr zon lim sat in the front seat, while the other three, including ong, sat in the back. > they had only been on the road for two minutes when they arrived at the junction of commonwealth avenue west by clementi road. > when the traffic light turned green, yap moved forward into the right turn pocket, stopping to check for vehicles coming from the opposite direction. > he saw mr ng li ling, 21, speeding towards him, but decided to turn right into mr ng’s path. both vehicles collided into each other, while the taxi also hit another stationary car at the junction. > the taxi and mr ng’s car were both severely damaged. at the time, visibility was good, the weather was clear and traffic flow was light. > video footage of the accident from yap’s in-car camera was played in court. > an analysis by the health sciences authority (hsa) found that mr ng had been driving at between 92 km/h and 97 km/h. the speed limit there was 70 km/h. yap was travelling at about 24 km/h then. > a further hsa report stated that if mr ng had kept to the speed limit, they could have likely avoided the collision. > all four victims were taken to the national university hospital, where ong was pronounced dead at about 10.30pm. > mr ting suffered severe brain injuries and was vegetative, but managed to get better. he was hospitalised for 54 days and referred to tan tock seng hospital, where he is still undergoing rehabilitation. > mr lim jin jie suffered a fracture, among other injuries. he stayed in hospital for eight days and was given 144 days of medical leave. > meanwhile, mr zon lim was kept on a neck brace and hospitalised for eight days. he was given 23 days of medical leave. > ‘horrific collision’ > dpp koh sought eight weeks’ jail and a five-year driving ban for yap, citing the death and serious injuries that resulted from the “horrific collision”. > yap’s lawyers, mr josephus tan and mr cory wong, asked for a slightly lower jail term of six weeks. > mr tan pointed out that yap had “stopped intermittently at the turning pocket and checked for oncoming traffic”, which was “in stark contrast to the typical dangerous driving or even careless driving”. > yap was also not speeding then, while the accident could have been avoided if the other driver was not speeding, mr tan added. > however, dpp koh said that nr ng’s speeding should not be a mitigating factor, as

"want to get back home at the end of the day in a levitating hovercraft? flying vehicles may just be a part of singapore's transport network in the near future; in fact, the ministry of transport says that you can ""bet your money"" on it. it has already taken initial steps to make it happen. the ministry's top official has told the business times that it is in talks with some companies to start trials on drones that can carry passengers. but human-carrying drones are not the only newfangled modes of transport to come to singapore down the road - on-demand buses that ply dynamic routes may soon feature in singapore's public bus network as well. these ideas were unveiled on wednesday at the second business times leaders' forum, where the ministry gave an idea of its vision for urban mobility in 2030 singapore. speaking to more than 400 participants, permanent secretary pang kin keong listed some of the trends and technologies his ministry is looking at for singapore's future transportation mix. noting that the availability and affordability of data and the rise of artificial intelligence are already upending the transport sector globally, mr pang stressed, however, that singapore's transport industry is up against land and manpower constraints. these constraints and trends will result in a different transport landscape for singapore by 2030, although trains will still continue to be the core of singapore's public transport system, he said. by 2030, there will be a rich and growing range of urban-mobility means. thus, rather than owning a mode of transport, it may be more sensible to pay for different mobility services tailored for different kinds of journeys. mr pang said that it may thus be possible to ride in a driverless pod to work, cycle to the gym after work, and then take an aerial taxi home. ""there is going to be a significant shift in the public mindset from one of ownership of transport assets - which is the mindset today - to one of procurement of transport services as and when you need them."" the convergence of land and air mobility can be a mobility option, he added, as he showcased images of three human-carrying drones that have already been prototyped. they are the hoversurf scorpion by a russian startup, the volocopter vc200 from german company e-volo, and the ehang 184 autonomous aerial vehicle from china. dubai is already planning to fly the ehang 184 as an aerial taxi as early as july. ""in 2030, you bet your money that aerial transport will also be a means of urban mobility,"" he said, but did not disclose further details beyond the ministry being in talks with some companies about putting human-carrying drones through tests. while the contours of aerial transport in singapore's network may still be hazy for now, a new form of service may take shape sooner. mr pang said in his presentation that singapore is looking at on-demand public bus services for areas with, and during hours of low ridership. this means that buses will ply low-ridership routes that are dynamic and responsive to riders' real-time demand during off-peak hours. this can eliminate the problem of empty spaces on buses, which is a ""terrible waste"" of taxpayers' and commuters' money, he said. mr pang told bt that the ministry is still developing the concept, ""but probably will share something later this year"". the transport ministry is also stepping up its efforts to push for driverless buses. it has signed a partnership agreement with a party to build and put such buses through a trial, and will be signing another agreement quite soon, he said.",['iloveincongruity'],23/03/2017,5,bus,Negative

"yes win for grab. win for taxi operators that's not comfort, as they may get more ""sales""/trips/passengers. but for comfort which has a huge fleet of cabs and the current market leader, partnering grab means giving them a piece of the pie for free, just so to be included in grab. this means that a slice of the cab fare revenue goes to grab just for providing the app platform. if that's the case, i am not sure if this is a great business decision for comfort. the recent uberflash partnership results in comfort drivers to earn less compared to a street hire or booking trip as comfort is not subsidizing the shortfall in the cab revenue. hence comfort drivers earn less in exchange for more trips that can be completed as compared to waiting for booking or street hire at. then where does comfort's revenue come from? it is from the cab rental. rental for comfort cabs is 90? reduced to 70? (not sure of the numbers) and that lioncity rental and grab rental is much lower iirc. then essentially comfort will have drivers returning cabs to them as they can get cheaper vehicles and comfort will suffer in rental revenue. tldr: comfort needs to rival grab or end up being just a taxi fleet renter company.",['lilfoot0'],17/02/2018,4,bus,Positive

"i understand it's within the rights of uber to charge as much as they like as a private enterprise. however, i don't agree with that as uber markets itself and acts like a public transport taxi service but at the same time uses such predatory business tactics. if they want to market themselves as a taxi alternative, then play by the same rules with regulation of drivers, cars, availability and fares. if they want to be private car hire then market themselves as that. that's a reason for regulations to safeguard interest of the public with regards to public transport. looking back to the days of unlicensed taxis in the past, i would say that a dose of regulation is good for this industry. if free market was in play for public transportation, then your bus and mrt fares will be 10 dollars cause who's going to compete with them? you might understand their business model and identify them as not a public transport, but is it the fault of the commuters not understanding that, as uber has marketed itself as a taxi alternative and not a private hire alternative.",['zed_j'],08/07/2015,4,bus,Positive

"the large portion of costs associated with hawker food is in the overhead of rent. this overhead of rent was increased tremendously in the 90s by a policy decision by then pm goh chok tong. the reason for this was to create a situation whereby we are beholden to our biggest asset - our flat or condo as the price appreciates we have to ensure that our biggest asset was well taken care off. this was coupled with another policy decision to have a public/private ownership of non essential assets. so hawker centers used to be managed and owned by nea/hdb. the reason is that the hawker centers was a public good meant to improve the hygiene of street hawkers. my understanding is that nea hawkers centers are no longer managed by nea, but instead by social enterprises and for profit organizations (e.g. ntuc foodfare). in order words if a hawker was making $5000 profit per month this year, the manager may decide to increase the rent (or management fee) $500/month the next. it increases their profit but at a low risk of the hawker bearing the cost and risk of moving. of course there will be an equilibrium whereby there are so few people wanting to go into such a low-margin business that the rents will stagnate to ensure maximum profitability. &#x200b; as such &#x200b; 1. the large conspiracy is that pap believes that by making singaporeans wealthy they will vote incumbent 2. their method of increasing wealth is by increasing the asset value of home owners (a large part of singaporeans were hdb owners) as well as privatizing non-essential services. 3. this meant that something that was in the past was a public good and could be publicly managed, is privately managed and profit can be taken from the producer without consideration of the value that is placed into the process to justify the profit-taking (of course they will say that there is a cleaning fee, or clearing tray fee etc, but since the manager is not beholden to the hawker, it is not necessary for them to justify said fee increases). &#x200b; in my opinion, the ownership of management facilities in hawker centers should either be borne by the taxpayer for proper oversight or should be given to the hawkers themselves as a constituent body with full transparency to the stakeholders so that producers remove extractive rent-seekers from the equation. &#x200b;",['very_bad_advice'],28/02/2019,4,bus,Positive

"singapore - two local motor companies have bought uber-owned lion city rentals, marking the united states ride-hailing firm's complete exit from singapore. waydrive holdings, a new joint venture between vehicle trader motorway group and workshop operator toh motor, signed on the dotted line on friday evening (jan 4) to acquire 100 per cent of lion city rentals (lcr) for an undisclosed sum. the straits times understands the transaction involves some 8,000 cars that are two years old and above, and an acquisition price of around $350 million. when contacted, motorway chief executive michael lim said the deal will include the takeover of about 150 lion city rentals employees, as well as its rented premises. asked why he was buying over the company when the market is deemed over-supplied with cars, mr lim said: ""eighty per cent of lcr cars are rented out. ""we are also in talks with grab and gojek to supply them cars. we will have a fuller picture in two to three weeks' time."" mr lim said the acquisition has been four to five months in the making, and that there were at least two other motor dealers who were in talks to buy over lcr. the deal comes eight months after uber and comfortdelgro called off an agreement for the local taxi giant to purchase a 51 per cent stake in lion city rentals for $642 million. comfortdelgro’s purchase agreement was inked in december 2017. three months later in march 2018, uber announced its exit from the south-east asian market. uber did not respond to press queries on saturday, but a spokesman said last september that ""lion city rentals continues to partner with thousands of drivers and hirers every day in singapore and remains committed to the market"". in an e-mail sent to employees on friday, uber chief international business officer brooks entwistle described the deal as ""good news for uber and waydrive... and great news for lion city rentals employees and customers"". he said lion city rentals ""business fundamentals are solid"". in another e-mail to driver-hirers, lion city rentals said the transaction ""will not result in any changes to your experience"", and that there would be no change to their contracts. although some industry players expect motorway's mr lim - known for his business acumen - to turn the loss-incurring lion city rentals business around, others are surprised by the deal. one said: ""drivers today prefer fuel-efficient hybrid cars. most of their (lion city rentals) cars are not hybrids. ""and in this business, a two-year-old car is considered old. each week, these cars can clock up to 10,000km, as the drivers drive for 10 hours a day or more to survive.""",['stforumtroll'],05/01/2019,3,bus,Positive

(aka why the dnb trains pass by stations at full speed) yokohama subway has overtaking tracks at kaminagaya station (and maybe more) where express trains can bypass locals. not here. a better comparison for the point you're trying to make would be the toei asakusa line, where the airport express services skip stops without a single overtaking track. then again, such airport expresses only run once every 20 mins, and only during off peak hours when the regular frequency is 5 mins anyway. definitely a no go short of expensive rebuilding, especially on the downtown and tel lines that need it more due to shorter station spacing. >being optimistic, i'd say it can be implemented tomorrow, by allowing people to board the ""do not board"" trains. these trains skip many stops at full speed just to return to the depot. imagine taking one ""dnb"" train from jurong east to bishan depot, with the train stopping at only cck, woodlands, yishun, and amk (to allow the rear train to catch up and not be too near to the train infront) before returning to the depot. lol no, this is so ridiculous i don't even go trainspot for a while. tell me where you see such ""do not board"" trains, and in which direction do they go off towards. >ps: till this day, singapore has no direct train or express public bus from the airport to the city oh, how i miss express 12... > >fast trains: > >how would you expect people to ditch their cars and take public transport if the mrt's top speed is mostly lower than the road's speed limit? > >mrt's top speed: 80km/h or 90km/h (nel only) (seems fast, but you have many stops along the way) >pie speed limit: 90km/h (if you're taking a bus, it's limited to 60km/h unless it is a malaysian bus) > >compared to other countries, jr east runs local trains at 130km/h, kl mrt has a top speed of 98km/h, and even jakarta is catching up with a new 100km/h mrt system > >if turning radius is a problem, get a tilting train like what is done in taiwan, such as their temu1000 or temu2000, both of which operate at 130-140km/h well, there's only so much the actual structure can take. go too fast and you get noise concerns and structure degradation issues (like bits falling off el structures in nyc due to increased vibration from faster passing trains). even the **shinkansen** runs at 110kph between ueno and omiya, because the structure is designed for that speed. they're investing in bringing that up to 130kph, but are bending over backwards to do it. --- edit: no, army boys, building express mrt lines won't help you get to gedong faster either. lympstone commando, being just a concrete platform next to a pair of rails, is much easier to set up than to build a station to the kind of standards we have here in singapore. at least founders memorial would probably have a few folks at all days of the week - a gedong station would be busy on friday and sunday nights, but as much of a ghost town as the twe stations at all other times. nor do people commute down from kulai or yong peng (don't know where those are? google is your friend) to work in singapore daily - that's the kind of distances japanese commuter express trains cover, which warrants the speed and the few stops.",['yuuka_miya'],04/04/2019,3,bus,Positive

"> #new rail infrastructure adds to rising costs of public transport: ptc chair richard magnus > singapore: the public transport council (ptc) will consider the rising cost of maintaining new rail infrastructure as it goes into its annual fare review exercise, ptc chairman richard magnus said on thursday (oct 19). > the council will also consider whether free pre-peak travel and lower off-peak travel fares will be made permanent. > mr magnus wrote in a blog post, titled balancing sustainability and affordability, that the council ""cannot turn a blind eye"" to rising costs as it has to ensure the ""viability of the public transport system"". > he detailed the cost of investments in public transport, such as the new downtown line and bus contracting subsidies. > the government’s investments in new rail infrastructure will cost s$20 billion over the next five years, and comes on top of s$4 billion to renew, upgrade and expand rail operating assets, he wrote. another s$4 billion will be spent on bus contracting subsidies over the same period. > ""while these investments are a necessary part of the government’s push to improve the public transport experience, they raise operating costs and impose a heavy cost burden on taxpayers,"" he said. > off-peak travel review > the ptc will also review the findings of the free pre-peak travel and the off-peak pass trials. > the council will assess if the tiered fares to incentivise off-peak travel should become a permanent feature, mr magnus said. > ""the concentration of travel within a few hours each day is resource-intensive and inefficient. a more sustainable solution is to spread out travel demand across the day."" he said. > ""the council is therefore evaluating travel patterns to determine how a differential fare mechanism can best help smoothen travel demand in singapore."" > mr magnus highlighted that singapore’s rail fares are among the lowest in asia, and considerably lower than those in australian, european and north american cities. the council has also got feedback from commuters that fares are affordable through focus group discussions, he said. > ""we must, and will, continue to keep the voices of our commuters firmly at the forefront, even as we consider the rising costs. we will announce our fare decision in due course,"" he said. > [source](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fare-review-adds-to-rising-costs-of-public-transport-magnus-9325772) --- v1.1 | [github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [readme/changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/readme.md)",['rsg-retrivr'],20/10/2017,2,bus,Negative

"because your purchasing power in singapore influences your perception of price. you may think that it costs more in nyc/london, but that is because you are comparing it with how much *you* can afford. same thing with congestion. you cannot use congestion as a measure of how good or bad traffic is. what you need is to compare the time it takes for you to get to your destination from you origin. even if the congestion you mentioned, it is still much faster to travel by car than by subway in nyc. people there value time over money. it is different here in singapore. the difference in travel time between trains or by taxi has a smaller margin compared to nyc, therefore, people here value cost over time. even though travel time by train is longer, people still choose to do so (because of a economics metric called [value of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/value_of_time)). therefore, this changes the perception of how ""good"" the public transport is compared to nyc. i do not claim that the *public transport* (trains/busses etc.) in singapore sucks. what i describe is the *system of bringing people from point a to b* (aka *transit system*) is flawed and already at a breaking point and extremely difficult to improve without tearing down everything and rebuilding. the added flexibility offered in nyc/london means that as demographics and social behaviour changes, the transit system can be changed easily. sure, cabs and uber is expensive in nyc, but there are many other means to travel. car sharing like zipcar cost like $0.50 a minute, citibike is another option, even walking or biking is viable. all of them are affordable. when you outprice an alternative against another, you create an illusion of choice, but that choice becomes far more inferior. even you have the option of taking uber/cab everyway in singapore, i come back to my original point that your purchasing power limits your flexibility.",['MINDEF_HQ'],07/07/2017,2,bus,Positive

"oh, don’t rule out the buses just yet! singapore has a surprisingly (even when i’m local) punctual bus system and all buses are well air conditioned. some buses will shorten the trip that will be longer with the mrt. moreover, all trips are distance based calculations so a transfer trip on the bus will probably just cost you a few cents. for example’s sake, if you were trying to get to little india from bugis, it could be a few transfer on the subway which could mount to at least 20-30 mins before reaching, but via the bus you could get to the same area in 2-3 stops, which excluding bus arrival waits can be as short as within 10mins. some tips to help you along the way, you may want to avoid traveling to the central area during morning peak and vice versa during evening peak, and during peak, especially morning peak, the crowd may get overwhelming at the station. in the city area, there are loads of subway stations that are very close to each other, and if you have a circle line (yellow orange line) option, almost 90% of the time during peak periods it is going to have lesser crowd compared to the north south (red) and east west (green). google is your best friend for transfer trips, but it doesn’t always tell you all you need to know. alternative route planner that i always use is gothere.sg. it conveniently has a browser version that is free to use and it gives you rather accurate price estimations of your fare, no matter bus/mrt or by taxi. hope you’ll have a good trip in sg!! if you need help along the way (or just looking for a local friend) you could dm me if you want too!",['eejhan'],16/07/2019,2,bus,Positive

"if you can't beat them, join them. that is exactly what taxi giant comfortdelgro is doing with a planned roll-out of non-metered fares. the cab operator may also open its taxi-booking app to private-hire drivers. the straits times understands that comfortdelgro, which controls 60 per cent of singapore's 20,000-strong taxi fleet, will soon introduce dynamic pricing - made popular by private-hire operators such as grab and gojek. unlike metered fares, which are transparent and regulated, dynamic fares fluctuate according to demand. on a rainy saturday evening, for instance, a $10 ride could spiral to $50. during a major rail breakdown, the same ride could exceed $100. sources said comfortdelgro will offer this fare option through its phone app, alongside regular metered fares. when contacted, comfortdelgro spokesman tammy tan said: ""we are always looking at ways to cater to different commuter and driver needs."" the transport giant has been looking to enter the private-hire space since its failed tie-up with uber last year, when the american ride-hailing firm decided to pull out of south-east asia. with the taxi business battered by private-hire players - average daily taxi trips have shrunk by nearly one-third since grab entered singapore in 2013 - cab operators are looking at ways to claw back their market share. with its shift, comfortdelgro is expected to eventually open its cab-booking app to private-hire drivers, numbering about 46,500. observers reckon comfortdelgro will not only be able to turn the tide with this move, but it stands to grow a new revenue stream from ride hailing too. there are close to 100,000 licensed taxi drivers in singapore, but fewer than half of them are said to be active. in a report last month, equities research house macquarie said that it was ""bearish on the taxi segment"" as grab's ambition to grow its footprint will ""continue to put pressure"" on comfortdelgro's taxi business. ""we have pencilled in an 8 per cent decline for comfortdelgro's average taxi fleet over our forecast period,"" the report added. regulations are in place for comfortdelgro's decision to take the fight to private-hire companies. the competition and consumer commission of singapore has mandated that drivers be free to use any ride-booking app they wish, and that operators cannot enforce exclusivity clauses. the land transport authority and public transport council have given the green light for surge pricing by taxi operators. mr ang hin kee, deputy chairman of the government parliamentary committee for transport, noted that some commuters are unhappy with surge pricing, but added that with comfortdelgro's large fleet, the ""ceiling of how high dynamic fare can rise may be curtailed"". ""furthermore, grab, gojek and comfortdelgro may compete through better terms and incentives to attract commuters,"" he said, noting that waiting time for passengers may also shorten with access to a bigger fleet. mr ang, who is also executive adviser to the national taxi association and the national private hire vehicles association, added: ""with the various fare types, comfortdelgro drivers will also experience less empty cruising and not depend only on street hailing or phone bookings. that is in keeping with available technology.

"i'm not saying you are incorrect, but it is simplifying a few things. the demand for usd and cnh is mismatched due to capital controls. in fact offshore rmb traded in hong kong (cnh) and onshore rmb traded in china (cny) run by different rates. and the rmb you see on global markets is most definitely offshore rmb. therefore, the weaker demand for cnh, because even with it, if you bring that currency into china to conduct business, that money will be subjected to capital control. china has been opening up to foreign investments, but it is still extremely restrictive. there is an abundant of capital in china looking for international investments, and those international investments are dealt primarily in usd. even if the investment has to be made with with other currencies, usd is the preferred currency as a medium of exchange in international markets. there are many companies which struggles to repatriate their profits outside of china due to this. the main reason for hk's current financial position is not just attributable to trust. as hong kong is the best geographical choice for international companies in certain industries to deal with china. as an international company, it can conduct business with china at arms length, and its capital flow is not constricted. there are also other considerations such as taxation. however, this is a deliberate design by china to designate hong kong as a bridge, and similar to most artificial construct, it could also be shifted and altered by the main architect, china. in a hypothetical situation where china decides to shift that cg to shanghai and lift onerous capital control for designated bank accounts in shanghai, hong kong's position will be disposed.",['power_gust'],18/10/2019,2,bus,Positive

">my entire argument is that a police state which imperfect surveillance is shit, but one with perfect surveillance is amazing. your examples all involve a non-omniscient surveillance system. imperfect surveillance makes everyone who does anything suspicious a suspect. perfect surveillance sees that 99% of suspicious actions don't mean anything, and so we'll be free to be shady af as long as we don't actually cause harm. the stasi was very well near-omniscient in its surveillance. they were already bugging every single phone line and apartment before the nsa even had plans to. they also had a network of informants that ran deep and wide. there are also stories from east germans that the stasi would break into a house, take nothing, but misalign something just to announce their presence. and you're missing the whole point of my argument against a police state. humans are not infallible. those in power have always proven themselves incapable of not abusing it. while a police state will enable to police to find and arrest criminals more efficiently, it will also serve to increase the efficiency of rounding up political dissidents as well. we're talking about people who just happen to have a different idea, nothing more. tell me, how are these people a threat to the nation? they aren't. but they will be a potential threat to those in power. nothing to hide sounds like a very nice argument to have, but can you guarantee that it will always be the case? that you do not need to hide your political alignment from the powers that be? that was the basic premise to 1984 afterall. >i don't delude myself into thinking humans can be altruistic. you want a big job done right, you pay through the nose to get it done. same justification the old man gave back then. while it has served to prevent corruption in government, we have had quite a few fuckups in the form of mbt and wks. paying through the nose demands results, not fuckups. >greed is only one side of the equation. everyone would rather have $4 million than $3 million. but if taking the $4 million came at the risk of losing the $3 million, the additional $1 million, and jail time after that, would you not just accept the $3 million and do the job? coreect me if i'm wrong, but it's usually niddle managers and generally people who aren't paid ridiculously well who embezzle money and engage in corruption. it's not that $3 million is enough to not want to be corrupt, it's that it's enough clean money that you wouldn't want to risk by taking dirty money it's not just the underpaid that will risk arrest. heck, the underpaid will have more to lose. they will be unable to provide for their families while in jail. the rich on the other hand can afford to go to jail for a couple of years. their investments and assrts can and will tide their families through with minimal discomfort. you'd be surprised at how many multi-millionaires would risk it all to have another million. you see, it's always a case of n+1. and jail time? it has been historically proven that the rich have more power than the poor in court. a mid-level exec and a ceo are charged with embezzelment of the same quantum. guess who gets a longer jail time?",['potatetoe_tractor'],30/04/2018,1,bus,Positive
"that's the problem. the crux of your reasoning depends greatly upon a ""best-case"" scenario. you fail to realise that the system you are proposing is never gonna be perfect, by virtue of it being run by people, by imperfect human beings. there has never been a perfect society, or a perfect form of governance, and there never will be. absolute power will corrupt. what may have started out with benevolent intentions will invariably result in abuse and perversion. human history is an endless cycle of people fucking over each other just for a quick buck. what's to say that those who execute your plan won't? to cite your example, >imagine if i said ""fuck lhl, he's an idiot, we should stage a revolution"". i'd get arrested if the government found out. but wiy perfect surveillance, they'd also know i'm just blustering to my friends to sound edgy and nothing's actually going to come of it, and so i get off scot free. the end result depends highly upon the assumption that the powers that be are benevolent and are capable of accepting criticism. do you see where this could go? you depend highly upon your government to be incorrupt, not in terms of money, but in terms of principle. but yet you fail to realise that it is an impossibility. please, show me a society or system run by humans that is perfect. also, there is a physical limit to the presence and surveillance powers of any intelligence operation. >near omniscient is not omniscient. the stasi had 1 informant for every 4 people, with informants ratting out each other as well. even if you discount the fact that technology at the time was pretty limited, they were still effectively watching every move that everyone made. with all the bugging of houses going on, there was never a time where you could take a dump without them knowing. if that isn't an all-seeing omniscience, i don't know what is. >suddenly, there's one red blip oon the screen. someone actually wants to revolt. do you a) kill them, showing the people that you might not be the best choice of government, or b) give him what he wants? what could he want anyway? what's wrong with his life? whatever it is, you can fix it with a snap of your fingers. within reason of course. define ""within reason"". who is to say what methods are reasonable? and does reasonable fall under benevolent? also, what repercussions are there if option a is used? the people have no power, and they know it. those who are vocal will attract the attention of the government and be promptly dealt with as yet another red blip. how will you ensure that option a will never be used? you can't. those in power are still human. they are imperfect. they are corruptible. they will still be equally prone to making shitty decisions all in the name of preserving their power. >everyone wants n+1. but how many will bet n to gain 1? you've missed the entire point. only a poor man would be risking n to get +1. a rich person would only be risking a small percentage of n to get +1. hence, it is inaccurate to say that rich people are incorruptible. statistically speaking, they have more to gain by being corrupt. >heck, the underpaid will have more to lose. they will be unable to provide for their families while in jail. the rich on the other hand can afford to go to jail for a couple of years. their investments and assrts can and will tide their families through with minimal discomfort. does that seem like a risk n situation to you? sure doesn't look that way. oh, and one last thing: >if you ran a oerfect police state benevolently two problems with this argument: *1. there is no perfect society, let alone a perfect police state. *2. benevolence has never gone hand-in-hand with totalitarianism. a benevolent police state is an oxymoron, on the same level as that of a peaceful war.",['potatetoe_tractor'],30/04/2018,1,bus,Positive

"in economics, welfare is often measured by the surplus generated from a particular choice of distribution. for example, in a [classical demand-supply diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/economic-surpluses.svg/350px-economic-surpluses.svg.png), the welfare is the sum of two surpluses, and is maximized when the market clears (i.e., the favored bundle is at the red equilibrium point where the two curves cross). you can prove or see visually that if you deviate from that point, you generate inefficiency by consuming too little, or too much of something - [""deadweight loss""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deadweight_loss). a situation like this - maximized total surplus - is what is known as *allocative efficiency*, where the maximum amount of benefit is achieved per resources you spend. a *pareto efficient* point is different. a pareto efficient point is one where no one party can be made better without making another party worse off. for example, if the economy has ten donuts and we both have five, i cannot make you better off without making me worse off. however, is pareto efficiency also allocatively efficient? let's say i value donuts at 1u each (5u) and you value donuts at 5u each (25u). then, by giving all 10 donuts to you, we increase the total surplus from 30u to 50u. we have obtained an *allocative* improvement by 20u, but only by hurting me by 5u. this happens to be a kaldor-hicks improvement because you can pay me 5+ϵ, and i am now better off by ϵ while you are also better off by 25-ϵ. we have gained both pareto and allocative improvements through a k-h transfer. --- the reason i mentioned it is because the conclusion that competitive markets are efficient comes from the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics, which briefly states that 1) any walrasian (competitive) equilibrium is pareto efficient, and 2) any pareto efficient point can be accomplished with a combination of endowment redistribution and letting the free market take over. as we can see from the donut example, we had *a* pareto-efficient outcome (5 donuts each), but not necessarily an allocatively efficient outcome (10 donuts to you). in a sense, the price mechanism can fail to generate max efficiency - we didn't include prices, but you can introduce prices, endowment ~~and asymmetry~~ (not needed) to demonstrate this. not all improvements can be k-h improvements. this is a more general statement about price not guaranteeing efficiency, not directly targeted at the taxi market. --- in general, any imperfection in the market generates allocative inefficiency. this includes monopoly power, barriers to entry (such as cost or regulations), information asymmetry (where one party knows more than another) and so on. the taxi market here demonstrates all of these factors, which is why the price mechanism can fail to bring about ""efficiency"". one might wonder why, at the beginning, i said that a classical demand-supply leads to efficiency while here, i said that the price mechanism can fail in doing that. the gist of it is that the models are different - when markets are imperfect, one party, either supplier or consumer, has an incentive to deviate from the perfect equilibrium. for example, if i have the power to slash quantity and raise prices, i might do so. you can see such an illustration [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/monopoly-surpluses.svg/326px-monopoly-surpluses.svg.png), where the allocatively efficient point is where blue crosses red. if i do so, i lose the revenue from the bottom yellow triangle, and gain the upper blue square, a net gain for me. the top yellow triangle represents the consumers who were cut out by the price raise; so yellow = total loss. if i were to force the firm to produce at qc on the x-axis, they are forced to sacrifice the top blue square and gain the bottom yellow triangle, but consumers gain the top blue square and the top yellow* triangle, erasing all allocative inefficiency - but at cost to the firm! the price mechanism has generated a pareto efficient point, but we show that allocative improvements can still be made. --- the truth, of course, is that transport economics is much more complex than that. but the rule that pricing may be flawed in flawed markets holds. that is not to say that the taxi market is inefficient, simply that there exists a strong potential for it to be. to fix the above, for example, the firm may charge different prices to different people (price discrimination). such is the case for area-based pricing, or student pricing, for example. in this case, the inefficiency is alleviated because everyone gets to use the service, but the benefits are skewed towards the producer/taxi firm. then it becomes not a problem of efficiency, but of ""fairness"", which is much more subjective. even now, though, you might be able to think of a number of examples of abusing things like student price (reselling, scalping, buying more than you need...), which can re-introduce inefficiency.",['denunciator'],20/09/2017,1,bus,Positive

[why you shouldn't use sms for two-factor-authetication](https://www.howtogeek.com/310418/why-you-shouldnt-use-sms-for-two-factor-authentication/) google has long ago identified this security flaw and prompted it's users to move on to its new prompt based 2fa method way back in 2016. and it has only been recently implemented across banks in singapore last year in 2017. whereby banks here are also now trying to do away with 2fa via sms when trying to log in to your internet banking. i can see why banks are rolling out these changes quietly without much elaboration because that's when customers and cardholders all go nuts knowing that the sms otp has always been their last and best line of defence when it comes to safeguarding their money. the best part is seeing comments scolding the bank for making unnecessary changes like these and don't fix what is not broken and doing this is not user friendly and makes life difficult for them and they want it to be revert back to sms else they will take their money out and put it with another bank. all i can say is, i'm not sure if this move from sms to device based 2fa prompt and otp is something mandated by the mas, if it's not, and any of the banks that i'm currently banking with were to tell me don't worry they will not be making this move, i'm definitely taking my money out from them instead. and other than banking, please also migrate your other online accounts from sms 2fa to device based 2fa instead (if that site supports it). you can start it off right here with your reddit account. there are many device based otp generator app out there and the best part is that you just need to choose 1 and it should allow you to add your various different online accounts like google, amazon, instagram, facebook, aws, paypal, discord, lastpass, dropbox, snapchat and more. i'm personally using the microsoft authenticator because i'm using a samsung s9+ and the microsoft authenticator is the only one that supports unlocking of the authenticator app via iris.. on top of the usual pin/fingerprint offered by others.",['PsychologicalPanic8'],02/06/2019,1,bus,Positive

"your reasoning is.... chaotic. it will end up back to square one or worse. now, lets evaluate this using economics. artificially forcing prices up is pretty much the same as bringing all that inflation in the next 50-100 years into the present. it does jack-shit. using economic analysis with the aid of supply and demand curves, one will realize that after the dust settles, its just a big 'ol inflation. the increase in price of goods with the introduction of minimum wages means that there is little change to the ""same basket of goods"" that a low income worker can buy at the end of the month: you double their wages, but double their spending as well. the middle income will feel the most pain immediately, and there will be 2 scenarios: 1. companies will eventually raise all their employees salaries to match the ""standard of living""; 2. the middle income now become the lower income due to their greatly reduced spending power (they can only buy half of what they can get previously). this puts more percentage of people into the low income group which creates a huge divide between low income and high income earners. income inequality will be very high. scenario 1 puts the whole situation back to square one. scenario two puts us in a much worse off situation. so, ultimately, forcing prices up does jack-shit. &#x200b; now, lets use a socio-anthropology analysis with a focus on socio-economics; why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer (or stays the same): mindset. long story short: you can never keep a rich man poor and a poor man rich. many poor people who strike windfalls end up in the same situation because of their mindset, while the rich can never be poor be it their aptitude to do business, their financial management abilities, how hard-working they are, their tenacity etc. the end-result is that we will end up back to square one with a major inflation if we introduce minimum wages and force prices up. the wages are priced as such in a society because of supply and demand. the guy at the top with his leadership, experience, flair, aptitude, knowledge, iq, eq (and whatever else you can think of) is there because no one can easily replace him. a pencil pusher on the other hand, can be easily replaced with another dime-a-dozen pencil pusher.",['Schryker'],28/02/2019,1,bus,Positive

">because haircuts being cheaper =/= everything being cheaper nobody said anything about everything being cheaper? i'm not sure why you are bringing this point up. > on the contrary people seem to have no inhibitions about paying a lot go coffee and avocado toast. sure. > i think in addition to the government signaling we can both agree than singaporeans themselves are pretty cheapskate when it comes to hawker food. so the observation i'm making is that singaporeans are cheap, the government reinforces this (or reflects this, probably both), and so there's significant cultural social and political pressure keeping hawker food prices cheap. not really. people don't really want to pay 15 dollars on plain aglio olio. if hawker food push up higher slightly i think people will still pay - i mean look at the new estates, the prices are higher than mature estate and people are still buying them. however, if prices go up closer to restaurant food, then more people will be priced out and opt to cook at home more often. this is happening in many countries where it's cheaper to cook yourself. > people pay $15 for bad ramen at ajisen all the time. there has to be socio cultural reasons for hawker food being treated as basically budget cuisine, and i'm just mentioning the government's role in perpetuating this culture. there's a difference between many different people paying for bad ramen at $15 vs the same person paying $15 for bad ramen everyday. ultimately people are still going to be moved by price. there is a reason why takagi ramen is doing very well. i think people will go for value, no matter what the g tells you. sure, signalling plays a role but people aren't going to pay more just because the g signals it. for every single hawker that is dying, i know hawkers that are driving mercs and buying landed property because their business is good. it is really just business. &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b;",['None'],28/02/2019,1,bus,Positive
"i’m not suggesting. i’m clarifying explicitly cuz i’m not interested to misunderstand you. wagyu is expensive not because people are willing to pay for it. it is expensive firstly because the process to produce wagyu is expensive, but people are willing to pay for it hence it is worthwhile to make it. it is economically impossible to say have an item that cost 10 dollars and yet charge 1000 dollars just because people are willing to pay 1k. basic supply and demand simply means people will enter the market as sellers because they can see the huge margins and hence your price will ultimately be driven lower. ultimately all business should be only making risk free rate + an expected % return of investment to compensate risk when equilibrium has been reached. if the roi is too low, due to whatever reason, business will close down. you don’t need to be making losses to close down your business. as long as there is a lower return to risk free + low alpha you will shut up shop and transfer capital to other more rewarding businesses that is worth your capital opportunity cost. so given the above, no matter what “good” is, or what “value” is, as long as the product you are selling is easily replicable which is the case for f&b, then you should not be making supernormal profit for a long time. re: thai express, that’s my whole point. if they can sell at 5 and make money, they would have. the reason they are not doing it is because they can’t make money. the reason hawker centers are selling at 5 is because they make money at 5 dollars price point. this is not because people have some weird hidden prejudice against hawker centers. fwiw, you look at zi char stalls. some of them charges more than crystal jade and are doing pretty well with people willing to pay. we are paying for value - whatever the metric is - and my take is that this value is highly tight to cost rather than some unquantifiable qualia. for your argument to have significant impact on prices, the mass populace must really be some dumb fuckers that is literally being hoodwinked about quality, i’m not saying this is not possible, for example diamonds - totally worthless and have a perfectly good substitute in artificial diamonds that cost less than 10% of naturally occurring diamonds but people still lap the shit out of it. but even then, the reason diamonds are expensive is because the cost of acquiring the raw diamond itself is expensive. personally i find it hard to apply the above on food which is an even more highly substitutable item in terms of similar product offering",['None'],28/02/2019,1,bus,Positive

"a) housing a-1) rent seems to be expensive, but i wonder if it is the same everywhere? of course rent depends on so many factors: proximity to mrt (train) stations, size of flat, area, how new it is, whether it's a condominium or a public housing flat. a-2) there seems to be two types - entire house for rent or partial house (some rooms) a-3) i'm married so i want to live in a house that is fully occupied by us a-4) i'm okay with a one bedroom house i could be wrong but i don't think i've come across a one bedroom house. the smallest ive seen is 2 bedrooms. a-5) i'm also okay with 30 - 60 minutes of commute. a-6) what localities should i search for houses? and what are the average rents there? depends on where your office is gonna be. in jurong east, bukit batok area.. common room - 400-700 is my guess. master bedroom - 800-1000. for an entire two bedroom unit, maybe 1.8-2.2k. a-7) do i need to pay an advance for the house before moving in? like paying 12 months of rent in advance which will be returned to me when i leave that house (it's a common practice in india) usually just one month deposit that's returned to you when you leave. 12 months? if anyone makes you pay that, they're cheating you. a-8) is there any other cost apart from rent? (like apartment maintenance fee, etc) if you stay in a condominium, you might need to pay maintenance. consider whether you'll really need a condo with swimming pool and gym and stuff. b) transportation b-1) cars are very expensive and i don't think i'll be able to afford them b-2) how much does it cost you to commute in bus/train per month? public transport is cheap. one way travel, max max max $3 per way. assuming 2 way, 6/day * 30 days = 180 (of course you don't work 30 days a month). c) groceries and household items c-1) we are two persons and we mainly buy vegetables, fruits and rice. c-2) we try to be frugal as possible c-3) what would i be spending on the above items? uh, i spend about 200/month on the groceries mentioned above for 2. d) mobile, internet, tv etc d-1) i need to communicate with my family and friends in india, what is the best way to do this? facetime? skype? whatsapp? i use all of these. d-2) is calling over mobile networks cheaper over apps like skype? what about incoming calls over mobile networks? just trying to get an idea here. incoming calls are free for most postpaid plans. d-3) how much does internet cost for usage like browsing, youtube, skype etc (no heavy downloads) unlimited broadband access - i think it's between 45-65/month, depending on your speed and duration of contract etc. d-4) i don't watch tv but i think i'll buy one for my so. how much do indian channels package cost? hmm check starhub cable tv's site. if i remember correctly from a few years ago, you need to get basic package + hindi/tamil/other channels, about 9/channel. maybe a total of 40/month for cable tv. e) what is a reliable website to calculate tax? iras f) did i miss any other important expenses? eating out? come on, new place, you gotta try new food! :) (and yes, you can find loads of veg food here if that's your concern. )",['Schlego'],27/05/2015,1,bus,Positive

"1. usually it's fully furnished in my pov. so you don't have to spend your money on furniture that you'd eventually leave behind when you leave. i don't think the rental amount will go down much if you request to remove some furniture. it costs money to get bulky furnitures removed. as for the bed, if you are sticky about the mattress, you can consider buying your own mattress? not an expert in this. when my hubs first came to sg and rented a place, he just used his own bedsheets over the existing bed. we use laptops but desktops are also wifi enabled (there are those dongles for desktops). home owners usually offer wifi instead of letting you use the router or ethernet cable (my understanding is because the owners are usually paying for the internet contract?). unless you stay with fellow rentees, you can negotiate with them? 2. most neighbourhoods have a mall near the mrt station. if that's your definition of good. popular estates like clementi will cost more for a room ($1k for master bedroom) and maybe slightly lesser for a common bedroom (but you have to share toilet space with another stranger). personally, i'd not spend more than $1k on rent (to ensure it includes utility bills cost). i've come across some landlords that charge a slightly cheaper rent but you have to pay for the utility bills. if you're living with your landlord, thre is a high chance they won't like you to cook at home. hence you'd be spending money on food or the occasional beer with your colleagues. my hubs found himself not able to save money in the beginning and it took some time for him. 3. you can consider renting rooms at commonwealth, queenstown or clementi. although i feel clementi's rates might be a wee bit more expensive. but i'm not in touch with the current pricing. 4. clementi has 2 malls near the mrt. it has almost all the shops you can find in town. there is a cinema there and it's pretty low in traffic. queenstown doesn't have a mall nearby but there is a mall (not sure if they have a cinema but definitely a grocery supermarket)and ikea one bus stop away. they have a food center there too with a wide range of local food at economical prices (great for the wallet). commonwealth doesn't have a mall nearby but there is seng siong (supermarket), food court and a wet market near the train station. 5. i dont see any drinking places around this area. peeps usually head down to holland v, clarke quay or robertson quay to drink. so you should be relatively safe if you choose to rent in one of the 3 options that i've shared. there might be one or two drinking establishments but i doubt it'll be too rowdy. 6. in my pov, i'd rather not share room or toilet with a stranger. but it all depends on your budget. hope that you can manage to get a reasonable rental :)",['regalaeros'],20/03/2019,1,bus,Positive

"most things have been more or less covered and i'll chip in some additional opinions, especially so since i just returned from london to singapore last nov. if you are working near buona vista (bv) you could (and actually should) consider locations along the yellow line as well. there are interesting and convenient neighborhoods along this line too. also, what amenities are you specifically looking for in terms of accessibility? the urban planning of singapore outside its historical centre includes multiple town hubs, usually near a train station, and then neighbourhood centres at a more local scale. everyday amenities ain't a big problem in most neighbourhoods as far as i know. although high street-ish facilities are integrated into malls, however, pubs remain scattered at more happening (and consequently more expensive) places e.g. tanjong pagar and holland village. since you don't mind to move further away from the city, for west i'd recommend areas like clementi (a very mature housing estate, highly accessible, and offers a range of amenities) and jurong east (the new hub in the west, but am not sure why i'm somehow picturing stratford without its major problems, however, it gets rather crowded especially during commuting peaks). i'd not recommend some expat hotspots in your case - bukit timah and upper bukit timah (beauty world) are not the most convenient places if you don't drive, although you could choose bus or bounce across a few lines in this case. holland village is a stone's throw from your office with a lot of amenities but it's rather expensive. central parts of singapore e.g. ang mo kio, bishan, and toa payoh, as well as the central-northeast e.g. farrer park, boon keng, serangoon, are really convenient to live imo. as for the east side, bedok and tampines are pretty cool too but they a wee bit too far. some parts of geylang offer plentiful studio apartments but do a bit research about that area might help your decision-making. a stereotypically 'boring' part of singapore around bukit panjang to hillview ain't too bad to live as they are not too expensive but still offer some amenities, just not that 'vibrant' to some. i'm sorry if this part comes way too messy, and it seems that i am just throwing in random places in. property guru, 99co, and stproperty are the most commonly used platforms locally so do play around with their features e.g. amenities within x radius. as for phone bill, gym membership, and insurance etc, do check with your company's actual package, because some do offer subsidies and benefits. food budget is fairly flexible if you cook and meal-prep, and would like to experience local hawker culture - getting a coffee at £1 and a meal at £3/4 is manageable. however, dining out at fancy spots and having a few drinks could cause some significant damage, and booze is especially expensive here. public transport is pretty affordable, and you could do your calculation to save more [with concession](https://dollarsandsense.sg/concession-passes-working-adults-ever-worth/) with some financial planning, i believe you could save a bit monthly, but highly depending on your lifestyle. and since you're gonna be in singapore, it's pretty easy to travel around southeast asia, and even further away. this could be another thread itself as different styles of traveling have very different financial consequences, but many destinations ain't too expensive and there are a lot of hidden gems regionally. and if you could secure some good deals, regional budget airlines are fairly affordable too.",['b_musing_l'],15/04/2019,1,bus,Positive

"> yes yes, i know y’all are gonna say what if it’s your sister, your mother, your daughter or your wife. what if it's you? edit: why the downvotes? i'm bothered by how people keep saying that people should care about sexual assault only because it could happen to someone they are related to. but why must the victim be related to somebody in order for this to matter? also, *what if the victim is you*? we don't treat other crimes like theft or murder the same way when trying to build empathy. people don't say ""stealing hurts people. imagine if your mother lost something she worked very hard for, or your brother gets cheated out of all his life savings."" that's just beating around the bush and is a terribly ineffective way to get people to empathise. instead, they address the person directly to evoke that empathy: what if this happened to *you*? so, why the difference with sexual assault? why the reluctance to evoke that same immediate empathy? because i'm certain that going ""but what if it's someone you love"" lets people falsely imagine it will never be them, and makes it harder for them to understand what the victims are going through, which is only contributing to the problem.",['anakinmcfly'],27/09/2019,-13,bus,Positive

">why leslie fong and bilahari kausikan see it fit to criticise the protesters and bring singapore into it . it is none of their business. we should be building good relationship with hong kongners. they are not doing us any good. > >moreover, they are wrong. the ccp is not the pap. they are a corrupted, semi incompetent party who regularly misuse their power. the xinjiang crisis is an example. > >before the extradition bill was past. the ccp kidnapped 5 hk booksellers for selling books that are critical of ccp. they even force them to parade a bunch of lies o if u actually take 1 min to think about the entire situation, everyone with any common sense would conclude that hong kongers are misguided first off extradition does not simply means china wants someone, china will get someone. extradition treaty doesn't work that way and this one includes many countries not just china. just look at how difficult it is to get james roach back to sg for a robbery trial 2ndly, hk court is the first line of defence and the law have already included many sub text to ensure chinese govt trying to get dissident via the extradition treaty will not happen. they already made provisions like human rights protection and minimum sentencing. hk claim that they are doing this to protect their rule of law, that being the case they already have the means to not send dissidents back to china even if the extradition treaty is made into law 3rd, the hongkies thinks ccp are retarded. u already mentioned ccp use underhanded means to get whoever they want. why would they risk using the extradition treaty to get pple via official channel and risk local and international political backlash. the answer is they are unlikely to. the extradition treaty is there to deal with pple who have committed actual crime and more likely than not, deal with the powerful tycoons in hk which they won't be able to use under handed means like kidnapping back to china. so not only is the stupid protest not going to stop china from moving political dissidents back to china, they've effectively protecting murderers, kidnappers and rapists as well finally, those supporting the hk protesters and the protesters themselves are shortsighted. china's deal with the uk only last for 50 years. 22 years have already passed. if hk play nice and give china what they want once in a while, china might allow this 1 country 2 system nonsense to go on beyond 50 years. as it stands, hk is no longer important to china, their gdp as a percentage of china's gdp has dropped from 20 to 3. the trouble that the hong kongers are causing is simply not worth it for china. this would impact hk and sg relationship.",['CharAznia'],06/07/2019,-16,bus,Positive
