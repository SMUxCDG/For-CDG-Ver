"your question is likely rhetorical but i had to get this out of my system :d i've spent more time thinking and researching about this issue than healthy and it comes down to varying combinations of a few factors:**1.** singapore (and countries like china) has modernised too rapidly in a short span of time - we went from having no television to the phasing out of it in the span of one generation. people are at various degrees of catching up when it comes to adoption of the technologies and social etiquette that entails.we are now capable of individual broadcasting in a format which never existed before and not everyone can manage a superpower like that.**2.** a lack of public education about socially-acceptable behaviour with technology usage. our system is very focused on achieving material results but have very little in the way of teaching cultural politeness (see japan). this is especially difficult considering you are now trying to change the actions of people across different age groups, countries-of-origin and demographics; habits that they've acquired all their lives from wildly varying backgrounds.we see how effective it has been to try get people to clear trays in hawker centres - something i admittedly found difficult to do in my mid 30s'!**3.** coolness. when i was much younger, i thought the music i listened to were ballerz and i wanted to be seen as cool by letting people hear the sounds bleeding out of my earphones. no one told me otherwise and i was left to figure out that it was not true. some of the offenders are stuck at this stage of thought and they may or may not want to get out of it.**4.** people who engage in anti-social practices have higher tendencies to live lives with negative circumstances outside of their control, and they are trying to exert dominance in other areas to compensate. pmd bengs with loudspeakers anyone?**5.** a lack of tangible, uniform societal pressure. singaporeans are very tame when it comes to correcting erroneous behaviour in public. op is a minority here because most of our population were taught from a young age to stay out of trouble. these situations are volatile and can escalate quickly to something that people may not want to be a part of.if a person is willing to be blatantly anti-social, they are likely to get into a shouting or fighting match with provocation. this can end up being a police incident or something far inconvenient that people do not have the time nor energy for. if the entirety of singapore is willing to collectively frown upon a certain set of public acts, it'll pose much less danger for the individual or group who performs the correction. but as of now, we don't have that homogeneity and will likely never, considering we pride ourselves on diversity.there is so much more to talk about with each segment but i believe that's the gist of it!",Positive

"help with what? everyone was clearly trying to get rid of her for holding up the bus. nobody gave her a solution other than just go across and take the same bus back. she needs to switch buses, the bus she mentioned that has ended was the bus that would take her home. she didn't mean to hold up the bus(she said it), i doubt she ever wanted to experience this situation. she did what she needed, the moment she got on the bus she told the bus driver where she needed to alight and questioned him multiple times if she was reaching etc. but the bus driver kept telling her ""haven't reach yet"". again, totally agree she's not behaving correctly. imagine her, in a new place, did everything she needed to get home, provided information(photos/destination), asked about it and yet ended up at the wrong place late at night, ended up with people berating her when she herself is very frustrated as well. the couple at the end, especially the lady talked to her nicely asking where does she wants to go and you could see that she toned/calmed down a lot in that split second and just talk it out.",Negative

"it's a scorecard of different criteria. like you said, a checklist. there is a score - how many criteria pass/fail = different clearance. the way you say it machiam like a true/false test paper of 20 question cannot have overall score, because is either true or false, nothing in between.",Negative

"amk hub somewhat has the same thing. problem is with the small taxi stand/drop off on amk ave 3 whereby many buses ply, some turning into bus interchange, some going straight, then the small taxi stand always results in a taxi queue forming which then only allows 1 for going left/straight for buses+cars and the other lane for turning right",Positive
"amk hub has a similar design, in order: a very popular bus stop just before a fucking crowded traffic light junction, a left turn into amk central, entry/exits for amk hub, a pedestrian crossing that has a overhead bridge right above it screaming ""use me"", entry/exit of amk hub's taxi stand, then another traffic light junction where buses turn left to go to the interchange but are usually slowed down by the hordes of people crossing the zebra crossing at the left turn.",Positive
give up nex is a real clusterfack. vehicle and human traffic is unreal,Positive
"similar problem near buona vista station coming up from aye side. iirc, drop off point, bus stop, taxi stand, traffic light. in that order. pain in the ass when train break down and the shuttle goes by that direction(no idea why they want to take that long route passing acsi; even if the boon lay way continuation that runs parallel to the tracks is narrower, it's generally faster moving).",Positive

once you get in the carpark it's still horrible. i don't know what kind of lanjiao architect thought that would be an efficient carpark design.,Positive
"the carpark enterance (not the hdb one beside it) is ok, but the internal design of the carpark is knnccb",Neutral

"you forgot about the entry and exit points of both carpark and drop off points.worse is, there isn't alternative car park entrance or alternative drop off or taxi stand.nex is better because there is options.",Positive
they actually removed the traffic light junction some time after amk hub was completed. but then put it back again after someone realised that a lanjiao architect forgot about disability access and made the bridge only have an up-going escalator and a set of stairs on the hdb side. because fuck the disabled right?,Positive

i pref to park there cos nex's carpark is shit.,Negative
"as some who frequent amk hub and nex, nex is the worse, probably the worst. two lane road with 3 different entrances within 20m, each with a potentially long waiting time. i've resorted to stopping at the hdb carpark beside it, via the other entrance, whenever i take a cab to nex.",Negative
yea i remember that. that bridge is just pointless honestly.,Positive

"i am not sure if you know this, but for alot of the buses that operate in singapore, the bodywork is assembled in singapore or jb. for sbs i know they use gemilang in jb.the chassis of the bus comes in (engine, suspension, exhaust and it is bare bone) from the manufacturer and it looks like this:[https://landtransportguru.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gemilang-coachworks-man-a95-facelift-38.jpg](https://landtransportguru.net/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gemilang-coachworks-man-a95-facelift-38.jpg)gemilang then adds the body works as specified by sbs or it's customer. these body works includes lights, seats, doors etc. the exhaust is part of the chassis along with the pipingso there is no way gemilang can and will change how the exhaust is piped out because it is part of the chassis. i also must add that any modification done to the chassis that is not done by the actual manufacturer may not always be legal in singapore.&#x200b;note: any modification to the chassis done by gemilang would also make the warranty for the bus chassis void",Positive
i've always thought that the new buses sounded bloody loud compared to the older buses. like i-need-earplugs kinda loud.and i've always suspected cuz the procurement team didn't do their fucking specification properly and only told the vendors they wanted the driver and doors switched sides and not the exhaust.now my suspicious are (partially) confirmed.,Negative

"the over-deduct is by design. when you board the bus/train, the reader immediately deduct the maximum amount possible, in case of a bus, the fare to the last stop. this is why you need to have some minimum balance. when you align and tap out, the device refund you the difference, so if you don't tap out, or the device is faulty, you will be charged as if you travelled to the last stop. this is also why you don't really need to tap out when leaving the bus at the last stop, unless you're transferring.i don't see why the companies are too concerned about you not able to tap out, it's free money. they are only concerned about you not able to tap in when boarding.from a technical perspective, it's a genius design because the whole system can work totally offline, no need for constantly being connected.",Positive
isnt public transport more concerned about earning money from the consumer? reimbursing money back isnt their main concern.,Positive
"are you being overcharged because the current bus stop indicated on the reader is incorrect?it's not a long term fix, but go to the front and inform the bus captain. he's able to override and manually the current bus stop forward and back.",Positive

"hey, same thing happens to me (and many others i‚Äôm sure). i only notice because i am abit of a cheapskate.what i do is to ‚Äúrefund‚Äù myself when possible. this means that, when i feel like i have been overcharged, i look out for a chance not to pay on a separate trip. so - i don‚Äôt tap in, especially when the bus driver cannot keep track of all the passengers flooding into the bus.i don‚Äôt do this often at all. only when i have been overcharged, or have suffered an extremely unpleasant ride (standing on the steps right next to the door on a speeding bus) etc. but it‚Äôs my little way of getting back at a subpar service. and also i tell myself pap cannot track me if i don‚Äôt tap.",Negative

"it sounds like op takes the route every regularly to know what price he should be paying. maybe something like taking the same bus to and fro from work every weekday. by that count, if in 2 months and countless journeys later, only five times he was overcharged, it means that there are times he was charged normally after an overcharge. this is a good indicator that the ‚Äúincrease in price‚Äù is not due to a price hike. also op did mention the whole story meted out over six months and was overcharged 12 times. numbers do not fit the price hike theory.",Positive

"the true problem is the way the article was written. it's not about what she said, but how. she seems to be putting the entire blame on the bus driver, which is wrong. the way she should have done it was to acknowledged her own fault and also given the bus driver the benefit of doubt that he may not have noticed the kid. at the same time, suggest that bus drivers should pay more attention to a kid travelling alone that couldn't pay, which would have been very helpful. i bet then the response would be very different. it's not so much that we don't want to help, but rather we don't like it when people feel (or present themselves as if they feel) entitled. same with mrt seats. if you need the seat, be nice and ask and i'll gladly give it up. if you're gonna be a bitch about it i'm gonna lie down across the entire row and take up every empty seat even though it makes me more uncomfortable, simply out of spite.",Positive
"she might be a good mother who's trying her best. but she sounds like to total bitch in the article. in my opinion, it's hard to put the blame on anyone for what happened. hard for the mother to be with the son 100% of the time. hard for the driver to keep looking at who scanned his card or didn't. for her to put the blame on someone else without looking at herself first is just a bitch move.",Positive

"just as the mom allowed the child to step out of her sight, are people honestly expecting bus drivers to be that watchful? are bus drivers to be blamed whenever this happens? in this case, it's ridiculous that any blame is even shifted in that direction. there will always be people who somehow manage to go under the radar. that's why there are random bus conductor checks.do note that there was no confirmation that the child was given a free ride(or noticed), the mom assumed that as a possibility and wrote her post based off it. people are quick to play the blame game, that mom need to put padlocks on her gate and secure her keys. put a gps watch on her child so she can track him easily. see, i made an baseless assumption on her security, i can now write an entire self righteous post about how such parents should have tighter measures when they have children with special needs in their house.she's running off on possibilities with little merit. when your foundation is off, it distorts the message that is being said. what's funnier is that she inferred from the entire incident that people who did see her child were not helping him, as if a child taking a bus on their own is an abnormality or that those people and bus driver are not compassionate beings.",Positive

"it can be hard to get the child back into the house. most people with autism have to stick to a routine, else they will have an epic meltdown. so you can't ask him to go back into the house nicely when he's supposed to have already left the house and was going to the bus stop. it will mess up his routine and he will get very very very upset (screaming, hitting, kicking etc). yea i get that a child having a meltdown is still better than a missing child, but at that point maybe the mum just wanted to take a chance and grab the book real quick :(",Positive
"frankly, i'm quite surprised everyone thinks it's hunky dory that a kid gets to go on a bus without paying. of course bus drivers won't know whether the kid is supposed to be taking a bus or not, but no one is supposed to ride on public transport without paying, surely?now just to indulge the two minute hate against the mother, we're saying it's okay for a bus driver to give a free ride?",Positive
"> so, let me get your stance clear: bus drivers don't need to make sure passengers are paying bus fare?please read. it's not their primary job unlike that of a lifeguard's who main focus is the safety of the swimmers. this is why your analogy is flawed.>i'm not saying the way things are arranged currently on the bus makes it easy for bus drivers to do so, but you, together with so many other people, seem to think that in principle bus drivers don't need to check fare payment.of course they do. but between focusing on the road and the bus being completely packed, it's completely understandable of a boy of a small stature manages to slip pass without paying. no reasonable person would actually blame the driver given the context. people are simply pointing out that it's a complete cop out for the women to not acknowledge any responsibility on her end, especially since it would be infinitely easier for her to monitor one child versus a bus driver who has to look out for hundreds of them.>we hold them responsible because it is their job. please don't say ""it's the job of a mum to look after the kid"".it actually is the job of a parent to look after their kid, which is why we're holding the mother responsible too. what a silly argument.>if a kid wanders away from the mum and into a gang-infested area, and gets beaten to death by gang members, are we going to say, ""oh it's the mum's fault..."".it is the mother's responsibility if the kid wanders off, why wouldn't it be? a tragic ending doesn't absolve her of that.",Negative

"many things. the fact that how buses, and public transport in general, being such a significant part of our lives, we should at least appreciate them in some form.i love riding buses. to me its a form of relaxation, to just do nothing and sit and watch the world go by. from an enthusiast's perspective, that feeling when you are chasing a particular occurrence - e.g. last day of service of a particular model, special appearance of a model on a particular route. the sense of accomplishment when you document it. i also enjoy reading about bus ops, scheduling... the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. as an enthusiast, i am able to observe things that regular commuters don't necessarily see, and as such view things like service disruptions, long frequencies a little more bearable, to a certain extent.

"hi,yes they are. buses have a statutory lifespan of 17 years, which can be extended to 19 (19.5 maximum). the original superbus, the aircon leyland olympian, has already been retired. its successor, the volvo olympian (basically volvo bought leyland and continued production of the olympian) are in the process of retirement. one particular trivia - one of the leyland olympians in our fleet is the last leyland chassis ever to be produced in the whole world. that bus is now preserved by a uk based enthusiast, and is (i believe) the only leyland olympian not scrapped.there are other buses undergoing retirement as well.from sbs 1) volvo b10ms - basically, almost every non-wheelchair accessible single deck sbs bus is a volvo b10m, apart from a few cng volvo b10bles found mostly in the west. 2) sbs transit's mercedes-benz o405s were also retired a few years back. theyy have different bodywork from their smrt counterparts and are also older, with different gearbox. i don't have much memories of them as an enthusiast though. they retired when i just entered the hobby, but i liked their front wheelarch because i could sit there and pretend to be the driver (was still a little kid then)3) scania n113crb. they were already retired when i came into the hobby, so i have no memories of them. 4) dennis dart. they were the shortest public buses in singapore at time of retirement at 9.4m (standard buses are 12m). mostly found on services 92 and 42, though the 92 ones were retired early, while the ones on 42 served until the end of 17 years.from smrt -1)  mercedes-benz o405s. they're the characteristic boxy buses that you see on almost all smrt services. believe it or not as robust and as modern as they look and feel many of them are approaching 17, 18, 19 (the oldest) years old. their bendy variants are also getting retired. they're a bit younger at 17, but with the new double deckers coming in and lta's (and probably the public) stance towards bendies, they have not received any lifespan extension. 2) the scania l113crl, its retirement was quite recent in fact, just last week. they're the ""old looking"" buses that used to be found on routes 178, 187, 852, until their progressive retirement started this year. a different variant of the scania l113crl, the same chassis but a different bodywork, was retired in ~2012. probably the worst ever bus that smrt bought. they also used to be found often on 178/187/852 - they're the dusty, squeaky ""old looking"" buses and their aircon was crap. glad they're gone, but us bus enthusiasts used to chase them a lot because they mostly only appeared on 178/187/852, so any other service was quite the special occurrence. they're actually newer than all the o405s and they retired before their lifespan was up. most likely due to the horrible condition they were in.3) the hino hs3krk and dennis lance. these were also retired early due to the poor condition of the buses - they were about 13~14, maybe 15, at the time of retirement. the hinos were the last japanese bus bought by smrt and were found around cck, the dennis lances were based at ang mo kio depot and served yishun.most buses that are retired end up in the scrapyard - most at kranji, a few at other places. some have been exported to other countries - the sbs transit mercedes-benz o405s have been refurbished, re-engined and rebodied and are now running as public buses in thailand.pics:leyland olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/22193-6/sbs9000s-51.jpgvolvo olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/8732-6/800x600xvo3x-premium-shentonway.jpg.pagespeed.ic.l-sfbdpuly.jpgthe volvo and leyland olympians are quite similar on the outside but there's a few notable differences, including engine type on the later volvos, the dashboard, lack of power steering for the leylands (made them very hard to steer) and 2 rear grilles on the leyland instead of 1 on the volvo.sbs transit mercedes-benz o405: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/622-10/sbs3798m-ct8.jpgsbs transit volvo b10ms: they came in several batches with different bodywork. all variants are going off now, some at 17 years and some at 19.http://www.sgbuses.com/d/47-10/sbs694z-99-sbs746h-96.jpg mark 3, retired in 2012http://www.sgbuses.com/d/9670-6/sbs886l-39.jpg mark 4 duple metsec, majority retired, ~40 out of 115 left in servicehttp://www.sgbuses.com/d/2633-8/sbs2631s-156.jpg mark 4 walter alexander strider. some are retiredhttp://www.sgbuses.com/d/2977-8/sbs2795c-15.jpg mark 4 duple metsec dm3500. just started retirementsbs transit scania n113crb: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/334-10/sbs3692j-225.jpg all retiredsbs transit dennis dart -

"that bus stop bollard is supposed to absorb the impact in case a bus barrels into a bus stop. its not gonna stop it but at least mitigate its effect. much better than if the bus just crashes straight in. i don't have stats on its actual effectiveness, but basic physics leads me to imagine it would decrease the chances of serious injury/death in case of such an accident happening.",Positive
"not sure what you mean about the pedestrian bridges though - personally i find them quite useful especially when the traffic light is quite a distance away. im more annoyed by traffic lights since it just slows the journey down. overhead bridges provide the solution.not only are the bus stops too small but passengers are also too lazy. often people cannot walk the distance of 1 or 2 buses because the bus is 2nd or 3rd in the queue. they expect the driver to literally stop in front of them.  this further delays the bus(es) behind, just so they can avoid walking a distance of like 15 metres. bus drivers should teach these idiots a lesson by just driving off. until then they will learn that their legs can be used for walking too, not just standing in front of the bus expecting the driver to stop in front of them. the only exception would be for the elderly",Negative

"the same way that planes are differentiated. buses are differentiated more by their bodywork rather than their chassis since that is where most of the differences lie. other methods include engine sounds, gearbox, lights etcfor eg: the man a22 http://www.sgbuses.com/d/45548-4/smb350a-852.jpg has this black structure on its roof which is its distinguishing feature and in fact differentiates it from all other bus types. also all man buses currently in service have the same front headlight cluster and bumper design. another eg: the volvo b10m. in 2011 there were 4 variants of b10m in service. the mark 3, the mark 4 duple metsec, the mark 4 walter alexander and the mark 4 duple metsec dm3500. the mark 3 has a round headlight cluster.the mark 4 is similar to the mark 3 but has a square headlight cluster and the radiator grille moved to the side. also it has a different gearbox from the mark 3. the mark 4 walter alexander strider has a front windscreen that angles inwards.the mark 4 duple metsec dm3500 also has a inward-angling front windscreen, but there is a ""depression"" below the front windscreen where the volvo slash would be. it also has a different gearbox from the wa strider.for smrt eg: the variants of the mercedes-benz o405the ""regular"" o405:some o405 variants originally came without aircon. the aircon was added later. these buses now have yellow tinted windows and roof aircon sets. the o405 variants that originally came with aircon have underfloor air conditioning that is not visible.the o405 volgren has a less ""boxy"" front:the o405g mark i bendy, is obviously longer than the standard o405.the o405g mark ii bendy has a curvy front with ""smiles"" below the windscreen. the front is often likened to the early mercedes-benz citaros.the o405g hispano habit bendy is, well, self explanatory. considerably more modern looking than the earlier two.the o405g volgren bendy has a front similar to the mark ii but there is a lack of ""smiles"" and the headlight cluster is more squarish.there are various other differences too, like interior, gearbox variant which i mentioned, and also registration plate. it may look like rectangular boxes at first sight but when you closely observe them they all have differences. it's like airplanes, you can differentiate an airbus a320 with iae engines and an airbus a320 with cfm engines by hearing the sounds each engine makes. the 787 has its unique wings that sets it apart from the similar 767. the 747-8 has a longer upper deck hump than the 747-400. etc etc etc....",Positive
"most variants of buses have different bodywork, so they look different. you just need to have the interest and the patience to pay attention to the differences. for the very few they are truly very similar: (for example the volgren bodywork on the [hino hs3](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sgtransport/8423892448/) and the [mercedes o405](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sgtransport/10506490666/)), the differences may be as subtle as the different dashboards and steering column, slight interior differences like seat positions, engine and gearbox sounds, radiator locations, and, if you're lazy, the registration numbers.",Negative
"i say it's a mix of poor driving attitude, crappy buses and ""old habits die hard"". the newer buses are much more sensitive on the accelerators and brakes, older drivers may take some time to get used to this. some types of buses - notably the scania k230ub which is the most common ""new"" single bus in sbs's fleet, due to a crappy gearbox and engine that makes the bus hard to drive and jerk very often. others are just drivers with poor attitude who cannot be bothered. our buses are quite powerful actually, the newest purchases output between 300-360hp depending on type of bus and engine.",Negative

"the newest buses being bought now are all complaint with euro v emission standards: https://www.dieselnet.com/standards/eu/hd.phpbuses come with technology like selective catalytic reduction (scr) which converts nox into n2 and h2o, through diesel exhaust fluid adblue (aqueous urea). others have exhaust gas recirculation (egr) systems which feed already combusted exhaust gas back into the engine, lowering combustion temperature and producing less nox as a result. both have their advantages and tradeoffs, but i think that scr is more suited for the singapore environment. egr lowers engine performance which is not very suited for city buses' frequent starts and stops. scr on the other hand utilises a much simpler concept reducing the need for maintenance.more reading:https://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/exhaust-gas-recirculation-egr/https://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/selective-catalytic-reduction-scr/we have also trialed alternative fuel source buses in the past, including a couple of hybrids (sunlong and zhongtong hybrids come to mind) and a hydrogen fuel cell bus that was supposed to go into service but never did. the former was apparently a headache for maintenance staff and had problems keeping schedule, which was why they were removed and sold off after some time.",Negative

"the tridents are not that new, they were introduced in 2001 so that makes them about 13 years now. this is a very comprehensive read: https://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/dennis-trident-3/i don't really like the man though. the design is nice but the bodywork is of very cheap quality (it is made from a certain company up north) - listen to the amount of rattling. also it is not quite well maintained. the citaros are much better, but i imagine in europe their standard is even higher. their bodywork is much more robust and of much higher quality than the man.that is a volvo b10m variant as well, specifically the mark iv duple metsec. it was the longest rigid bus at 14.5m, with a tapered rear for easier turning. it was initially on trial as part of plans for high capacity buses, but it didn't really work out since no more were ordered. it's probably due to the long distance between the doors creating inconvenience for pax (especially the ones at the rear), and the increased length making it difficult for the drivers. that bus also used to ply service 174 in its initial years... after its stint on 62 it was redeployed to 83 in sengkang where it served until its end of lifespan at 17 years. sbs originally had 2 bendies, a volvo b10ma (this also had a tapered rear because it was longer than average bendy buses) and a mercedes-benz o405g. yes they indeed did svc 18 before. i never had the chance to ride them - they were exported to new zealand, i'm not sure if they're still running though - they should be getting quite old already.i really love the non a/c buses too - without the a/c they are just so much more powerful, even more when certain buses have no speed limiter. really enjoyed my last rides on them in the jurong industrial area before their retirement in late 2012. i'd kill to get some of those back!yes smrt is phasing out their bendies... like i mentioned above the mark is are already undergoing retirement. if you hang around kranji enough you may see one getting towed to the scrapyard, with doors open, smrt logo removed, sometimes windows broken, it's quite a sorry sight because just a few days earlier those same buses were still in tip top condition carrying pax. they're all going to be replaced by double deckers, the only remaining bendy would be the demonstrator bus smb388s, delivered in 2013 now plying svc 190. it was intended as a one-year trial for its particular model, to date no more have been confirmed but there are rumours flying around in the community of 40 more buses as a one-to-one replacement of the mark is. even if they are brought in, they will probably be deployed on feeder routes, with the double deckers on the longer trunk routes..",Positive
"lta does not generally like bendy buses, as they take up more road space. smrt has commented that they will purchase more, and made a few comments about how they plan to deploy them alongside the new double decks. in general, i expect to see bendy buses in short-distance high-capacity routes (like feeder services), and less on longer-distance trunk services.",Positive
"we'll have to go into the pros and cons of bendy buses vs. double deck buses. bendy buses:  pros: faster disembarkation due to 3 doors. slightly higher capacity, standing allowed throughout. can run almost all routes due to the articulation, which makes them rather flexible.   cons: takes up more road space: rigid buses are usually 12m, bendy buses are 18m. blocks traffic and uses more of the bus stop length. double deck buses:  pros: more seats. has the same footprint as a single deck rigid 12m bus.  cons: slower disembarkation: between the stairs and the exit door is a usual bottleneck. less standing room. can only be assigned to fixed, approved routes due to height and clearance. lta has to consider factors beyond just public transport: they also need to factor the effects on other road traffic. does the advantages of bendy buses outweigh the additional footprint? we don't know for sure the reasoning, for they're probably a combination or all of the above.",Negative
imo: bendy buses take up more road space in land scarce singapore. double decks can carry the same amount of passengers but require less space hence they are more suited for singapore roads. however bendies have a faster boarding and alighting time due to more doors and thus would be more suitable for shorter feeder services.,Positive

"here's one fact: sometimes at night, apart from the off service buses, you'll see very irregular buses running with service numbers like eb10, or wt1. those stand for ""employee bus"" (sbst) and ""worker transport"" (smrt), and are internal bus services that ferry employees after operation hours to, from, and between bus parks and depots. they don't operated on fixed routes though, so it's even harder to specifically look out for one unless you wait around the depots. edit: i don't really know about the behind the scenes, but it involves returning to depot, refueling, cleaning, and maybe driving off to park for the night at the bus park (which are sometimes away from the depots).",Positive

"since this is an ama, i will answer everything as honestly as possible. most of this is restricted to the younger/newer enthusiasts, i myself was like that when i started off but now that i am older i understand the consequences of my actions and stick to safe places to get my pics.* running around the bus interchange. i get it if you're running for the bus but don't run all over the interchange, all the time, shouting at one another. people think you are crazy and you are just a hazard to others. * running around the road. i see people standing on the centre divider snapping buses all the time. the more atrocious people stand on the middle of the road. *the middle of the bloody road.* i cannot comprehend how they have the guts to do that because i will certainly not risk getting hit by a car for a photo of a bus that is likely to come back an hour later in the opposite direction.* screaming and shouting. this, honestly, isn't reserved for only bus enthusiasts, but youths in general. i find most don't know how to conduct themselves appropriately on public transport, and it is very irritating. i'm a natural introvert that hates loud voices so it's even more irritating for me. as an enthusiast, however, i would imagine they know public transport etiquette.* disturbing the driver and taking advantage of him. this is mainly restricted to the younger enthusiasts but leads to horrible consequences. there was a particularly high profile incident on the last day of a particular bus service; the driver was an extremely friendly and helpful person who has been complimented numerous times in the past. a few people took advantage of her kindness and tolerance towards enthusiasts, spent the entire trip at the entrance door talking to her, disturbing her and being a nuisance to passengers. the company found out and she did receive some form of penalty, because nuisance enthusiasts cannot control themselves. some other enthusiasts have also been known to take advantage of nice bus drivers to get free rides, rides on off service buses etc.... that is putting the driver's ricebowl in danger for their own gain. how selfish and how disrespectful. **idiots**.* flamebait. politics is rife in our hobby, as for the current situation i think it is rather peaceful. there are many factions within the community, and so far efforts to unite them have been rather futile due to vastly different ways of thinking. usually nothing happens, but every now and then some idiot will try to aggravate/wrongly accuse other parties leading to flamewars and shit. and the way they treat the mentally impaired members of the community is downright disgusting. i'm not even requesting you help them, assist them in everything. the very least you can do is to leave them alone. i personally am not a professional and i find it hard to communicate effectively with others so mostly i do not interact much with these people, but it pains me when people make fun of their condition and repeatedly abuse them. yes having a mental impairment is not an excuse, but we still have to show understanding and accept them for who they are. it shows a lot of who they are as a person.",Positive

"reddit hasn't been nice to you but i will echo your sentiments because this system did not critically consider this:**my reasoning is simple why should someone with disabilities make it visually obvious when ones medical condition is private.**this intentionally imposes a certain expectation of the disabled. my friend who has a slip disc may still be able to stand or sit or move around. what if this said friend wears the sticker, got a seat, and later walked down the escalator reasonably? what would the people around think? they would impose their expectations of him standing on the left or taking the lift, and possibly thought he or she gamed the system. (sure, the counterargument is that you can put on and take off the sticker, but then if you put on the sticker at that point in the mrt, because you needed a seat at that time, then what? it imposes an explanation to the person giving up the seat as well. ""why do you need to seat? what injuries do you have?"")beyond that, this sticker has a lot of problems drawing distinctions of able-disabled binary where we should look beyond that and give to those in need. lta is purposefully drawing this line within the public transport spaces with the social good in mind but without considering other social factors.in addition, socially engineering this is not going to help, especially when intersectionality of age and disability has not been considered: i wanna see how a young person with sticker compete with the middle-aged and elderlies without stickers.",Positive
"then i put the question to you: how should your friend - or any other person, for that matter - signal that they need a seat if and when they really need one? expectations are going to be imposed nonetheless.",Positive
"the answer is simple but not easy: to remove the categorization altogether beyond able-disable binary. essentially, it means when you give up this seat to this person, the schemas of the disabled and its current nuances are not used for or against the person. the difficulty (or ridiculousness of it, for most people) is that ""how can this be possible?"". but by allowing stickers, you reinforce that notion. so while not having stickers has its own issues, it's by far leading to the desired direction in the bigger picture.it gets a lot more theoretical (not that it does not impact reality), but i think the point isn't so much for us to deconstruct and reconstruct a whole reality at this point. what we want to see is whether lta has considered these medical ethics and social implications when pushing this idea instead of going ahead just to fulfill someone's improvement kpi and favourable performance index.",Positive

that's what i was guessing for my case(not that i stopped taking public transport for a long time) as well. got away progressively in my case .,Negative
>facilitates movement towards the exit in case of an accident. ouch. have you experienced many accidents in buses that this became a consideration for you? haha. anyways i tried sitting at a front facing seat today. i was okay until the bus became too crowded for me to stare at the road ahead. can't look to the side also cause of fogging (the a/c is damn cold) + advertisement stickers at the side. i closed my eyes and restrained myself from redditing. giddy but no vomit ! great success.,Positive

"> # no roll-out of on-demand buses as trial reveals higher costs> singapore - singapore will not roll out on-demand buses, which operate like phone-booked taxis, because of higher costs involved.> the land transport authority said on friday (may 31) that a six-month trial of on-demand buses - which plied the joo koon and marina-downtown areas - will conclude on june 15.> during the trial, it found that these buses were costlier to run than regular, fixed-route buses.> ""mileage savings were observed during the trial, but it is currently less cost-effective for on-demand public buses to be scaled up due to high technology costs,"" the authority explained in a statement.> compared to fixed and scheduled bus services, operated mileage in the same area was 18 per cent lower during the trial, the lta added, noting that this meant fewer buses were required.> but the system ""is currently less cost-effective"" because of ""high software development costs"".> ""larger-scale deployment of on-demand public buses is expected to become more cost-effective in the future when the efficiency of algorithms improves,"" the lta said.> related story what you need to know about on-demand public bus services> the system would also become more efficient when driverless buses are ready, it added.> more than 26,000 rides were booked during the trial to date. and according to an lta passenger poll, about half of those who were aware of the scheme had tried it. but there was also ""a significant group of commuters who were either not aware... or chose not to try it"".> the latter group said regular bus services provided greater certainty. they also felt uncomfortable with using a mobile application to book a bus ride.---1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Positive

"there is very few comparable , running projects on a big city scale that have a system like this. estimation in that case is challenging and trial is a very effective way of generating data to make a long term projection. development costs here includes likely long term devops and a decision will not be based on fixed costs but cost to utility ratio. if demand and traffic optimization benefits are great, high cost can be justified. likely, demand and efficiency gain was not that great enough to justify further development at projected cost.",Positive
"thank you for your explanation. i can accept it.in any case, the article's thrust seems to be pinning the blame on development cost by sayings it's high, instead of giving more context like you. the development cost cannot be said to be high or low, because there is no comparison to development costs by other vendors (higher than what thing?). if it must be high, then the take up rate should be said to be low(er than hoped).",Positive

"peak hour is a function of user behavior, and is not something that arises from a common definition of ""public transport"". unlike mrts and a lesser extent buses (who get bus lanes), taxis share the road with private cars, and so the taxi peak hour is more related to peak hour for private cars. if i had to guess - taxi (and car users) experience  slightly delayed peak hour compared to mrt/buses because taxi and car users anticipate a shorter journey as compared to using public transport. so everyone sets out later.",Positive
"just to give one small reason why taxis may have different peak hours. **also, this is a hypothesis which is valid only for evening and i don't have any actual data to prove it. i could be wrong as well.**i would say people taking taxis and buses/mrt are coming from a different economic background. i would say generally someone   would be higher up in the hierarchy of any organization and an extension of that is they would be willing to pay for a taxi ride from my personal observation i would say the higher your position, the later you work in office. leaving late from office you may be willing to take a taxi instead of bus/mrt which may account for different peak timings in the evening.",Positive

"cos you look at smrt which has both mrt/bus and taxi but the peak hour for both is different. not only does taxi is able to maximise profit by having longer peak hours, the mrt/bus's shorter hours also reduces cost for them as they only need to have more services for a shorter period of time. if you consider the demand for public service transportation as a whole, shouldn't it be going up (peaking) at roughly the same time? if they justify that after 6pm onwards, people are going home so there higher demand(peak) for taxis. shouldnt the mrt/bus demand is also be higher(peak) and hence consider their peak as after 6pm and be held to a service level of lower frequency after 6pm accordingly? but right now their peak is only 1700 to 1900.",Positive
