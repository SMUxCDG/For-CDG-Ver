"your question is likely rhetorical but i had to get this out of my system :d i've spent more time thinking and researching about this issue than healthy and it comes down to varying combinations of a few factors:**1.** singapore (and countries like china) has modernised too rapidly in a short span of time - we went from having no television to the phasing out of it in the span of one generation. people are at various degrees of catching up when it comes to adoption of the technologies and social etiquette that entails.we are now capable of individual broadcasting in a format which never existed before and not everyone can manage a superpower like that.**2.** a lack of public education about socially-acceptable behaviour with technology usage. our system is very focused on achieving material results but have very little in the way of teaching cultural politeness (see japan). this is especially difficult considering you are now trying to change the actions of people across different age groups, countries-of-origin and demographics; habits that they've acquired all their lives from wildly varying backgrounds.we see how effective it has been to try get people to clear trays in hawker centres - something i admittedly found difficult to do in my mid 30s'!**3.** coolness. when i was much younger, i thought the music i listened to were ballerz and i wanted to be seen as cool by letting people hear the sounds bleeding out of my earphones. no one told me otherwise and i was left to figure out that it was not true. some of the offenders are stuck at this stage of thought and they may or may not want to get out of it.**4.** people who engage in anti-social practices have higher tendencies to live lives with negative circumstances outside of their control, and they are trying to exert dominance in other areas to compensate. pmd bengs with loudspeakers anyone?**5.** a lack of tangible, uniform societal pressure. singaporeans are very tame when it comes to correcting erroneous behaviour in public. op is a minority here because most of our population were taught from a young age to stay out of trouble. these situations are volatile and can escalate quickly to something that people may not want to be a part of.if a person is willing to be blatantly anti-social, they are likely to get into a shouting or fighting match with provocation. this can end up being a police incident or something far inconvenient that people do not have the time nor energy for. if the entirety of singapore is willing to collectively frown upon a certain set of public acts, it'll pose much less danger for the individual or group who performs the correction. but as of now, we don't have that homogeneity and will likely never, considering we pride ourselves on diversity.there is so much more to talk about with each segment but i believe that's the gist of it!",Positive

"i was eating/reading at the fine establishment known as mcdonald's yesterday when these two guys came in at sat on the same bench thing as me, a few places down. first they splashed their coke over the table, then they proceeded to talk incredibly loudly in hindi (i think), while constantly banging their hands and elbows on the table as they spoke. then they started playing videos on near full volume on one of their phones. this was at like 3 too, and there a few people studying/working in there too. it was a rip",Negative

">if you were the one who were in china and trying to figure the way back in a foreign country where you can’t read half the road signs or figure out the way back easily late at night, moreover as a working class woman, what would you do?happened to me in thailand. mind you, not in bangkok where people know some basic english. i was in countryside-thailand, an hour or two out of the touristy area, it was night and i was trying to take the public bus back to bkk. the driver of the bus we were on suddenly stopped and lots of people started getting off. suddenly he chased us off the bus in thai too. you can only imagine how scared we were because he wasn’t being too friendly about it either. thank god we asked around if anybody spoke english and someone stood up and help us translate. turns out we were on the wrong bus and the bus had reached its terminal (somewhere out in the woods) so the driver was telling us to get out before he made a uturn and loop his service back. point is, we were in the wrong bus. that lady missed her bus. both of us didn’t understand the driver. but i didn’t stop the bus from moving and demanding the driver bring me to my destination, even though i was scared, it was dark already, i didn’t know the language and i didn’t know the way home. at least she got lots of people she can speak to. we only had the one who we had to ask around to find.",Negative
"uh if you tried doing what she did, you'd get physically thrown off the bus in lots of big cities. i've taken plenty of night busses in foreign cities and i'm sure i would get my ass beat if i behaved like that. she's not a kid. she's a grown ass adult and she should handle her problems instead of making it everyone else's. i understand that she is scared and annoyed but this in no way excuses her behaviour. there's someone over the intercom suggesting that she wait for another bus (there are night busses) but she's insisting that she was on the last bus.",Positive
it's not like she's the only one who can speak chinese. there were people there who can understand her. the person over the intercom was trying to help too. she just needs to calm down. no excuses for this kind of behaviour.,Positive
"well assuming that phone she is holding has google. she has access to google maps. lo and behold, google even tells you what time the next bus is coming. i've gotten lost in foreign countries at night, in the dark. many people have. most people just don't have the selfishness to hold up buses and demand stuff. nobody forced her to come here. if you're in a foreign country don't become a nuisance.",Positive
"well, it's on her if she can't speak the lingua franca of the country she chose to work in. it's ridiculous if i move to germany and expect the bus driver to speak mandarin, right? since she couldn't communicate with the driver, it was her responsibility to find another way to figure out how to get home. she could've even asked another passenger, used a translation app etc. her actions are simply inexcusable.",Negative

"jesus christ, you make it sound like there's no taxis in singapore or something.",Positive
my exact thoughts after watching the video. not that it excuses her behaviour in anyway but even i could pick out the fear and desperation in her voice. unfortunate situation.,Negative
take a bloody taxi,Negative
"not only that, she asked the bus driver multiple times as well. i think i heared her mentioning the need to switch bus and that bus service has ended? which probably multiplied her anxiety and she doesn't even know where she is. i don't agree with her behaviour as well (shouting/expecting the bus to u turn). at the end, a couple probably offered her a solution which was what she needed rather than other people who just focused on getting rid of her.",Negative

"people are trying to talk to her. the person over the intercom is probably offering a solution? singaporeans can be kind and gracious, there were chinese people around who i'm sure will be glad to help her find her way back?? if someone needed help finding their way around i definitely would help. so there's really no need for this kind of public freak out.",Positive

"help with what? everyone was clearly trying to get rid of her for holding up the bus. nobody gave her a solution other than just go across and take the same bus back. she needs to switch buses, the bus she mentioned that has ended was the bus that would take her home. she didn't mean to hold up the bus(she said it), i doubt she ever wanted to experience this situation. she did what she needed, the moment she got on the bus she told the bus driver where she needed to alight and questioned him multiple times if she was reaching etc. but the bus driver kept telling her ""haven't reach yet"". again, totally agree she's not behaving correctly. imagine her, in a new place, did everything she needed to get home, provided information(photos/destination), asked about it and yet ended up at the wrong place late at night, ended up with people berating her when she herself is very frustrated as well. the couple at the end, especially the lady talked to her nicely asking where does she wants to go and you could see that she toned/calmed down a lot in that split second and just talk it out.",Negative

do you mean clearance? or is there a score for this? do enlighten us!,Negative
"sure you can panic, but that doesn’t entitle you to act inappropriately. as an adult it’s your own responsibility to make sure that you can find your way home. while the bus driver can assist you, it’s not his responsibility. most bus drivers i’ve seen would actually take time to tell you how to get to your destination. what bugs me in this case is her sense of entitlement in expecting the bus driver to be able to speak her language. after all, this is not a chinese country. she should be well aware of that. or maybe we’re not sending the message strong enough.",Positive
would you freak out to that extent though? lmao,Neutral
i don’t think you know the meaning of woke.,Neutral
then stop taking yourself some fcking seriously lol,Positive
"there is a scorecard for clearance - which includes the following:   \- parents nationality (how many generation of singaporeans)\- parents criminal records \- relatives mental health\- any prominent opposition supporter from this and other criteria they will determine whether you have the clearance or not. note that most of these is totally out of your control, but it affects your score and your ability to climb the ladder in your job.&#x200b;what i am not sure of is whether they use the same scorecard for scholarship selection. &#x200b;&#x200b;",Positive
"that $30 a day may have wiped out her entire day’s wage or the remaining savings. to some of us, it’s not an issue. to someone like her, it’s the difference between having just enough for food or save up for buying necessities, or to send an extra bit home.",Neutral
"maybe. have you ever freaked out at least once in your life? it’s a genuine question. we’ve all been those at least one of those moments. different people react differently. not everyone is born calm or can react calmly, especially if most of the factors are stacked against you.",Positive
"it's a scorecard of different criteria. like you said, a checklist. there is a score - how many criteria pass/fail = different clearance. the way you say it machiam like a true/false test paper of 20 question cannot have overall score, because is either true or false, nothing in between.",Negative
"where are you getting that she's poor from this video?she had a phone, clean nice clothes, makeup, hair, a bag, shopping or another bag, a watch and she's in singapore but most likely not from singapore.  none of that says ""i'm too poor to take a taxi.""  but even if she couldn't she has a phone, just pull up the bus schedule and catch another one.",Positive

nex is one true clusterfuck,Positive
there's always a long queue to pick up and drop passengers at serangoon nex which traps the buses in the bus stop or behind the queue.,Negative
that nex junction is one hell of a stupid design. so is their carpark that jams up the whole road.  dont even know what lta can do about it. it’s been like that for years. cap the amount of waiting taxis and fine the rest?,Negative

nex is really cannot fasterpark.,Positive
"amk hub somewhat has the same thing. problem is with the small taxi stand/drop off on amk ave 3 whereby many buses ply, some turning into bus interchange, some going straight, then the small taxi stand always results in a taxi queue forming which then only allows 1 for going left/straight for buses+cars and the other lane for turning right",Positive
"amk hub has a similar design, in order: a very popular bus stop just before a fucking crowded traffic light junction, a left turn into amk central, entry/exits for amk hub, a pedestrian crossing that has a overhead bridge right above it screaming ""use me"", entry/exit of amk hub's taxi stand, then another traffic light junction where buses turn left to go to the interchange but are usually slowed down by the hordes of people crossing the zebra crossing at the left turn.",Positive
give up nex is a real clusterfack. vehicle and human traffic is unreal,Positive
"similar problem near buona vista station coming up from aye side. iirc, drop off point, bus stop, taxi stand, traffic light. in that order. pain in the ass when train break down and the shuttle goes by that direction(no idea why they want to take that long route passing acsi; even if the boon lay way continuation that runs parallel to the tracks is narrower, it's generally faster moving).",Positive

the internal layout and escalator of nex is quite strange. i always find myself on the wrong floor.,Negative
lta stipulates where bus stops and taxi stands are supposed to be located. so if you dig deep into the tender agreement you can find such details.,Neutral
"the escalator in the center of building is always crowded especially at level b1 and level 1. it's simply bad design to only have 1 set of escalators to cover such a wide area. bras basah station got 2 sets of escalators for some reason, it's not even a crowded station.",Negative

"when you have a kid that doesn't follow instructions, lives in his own world and will have a massive breakdown if his routine is broken it's not unreasonable to expect that he will get lost at some point unless you are physically restraining him 24/7. for example imagine you are searching for ez link card and your teenage kid decides to shake off your grip and dash off into the crowd on an mrt platform or worse into the mrt train. i don't think as a 40 year old you may even have the fitness to catch him.",Negative

"that's the thing, isn't it the responsibility of the bus driver to check that people are paying fares? i'm not saying that bus drivers will be able to detect every last fare dodger, but surely asking a bus driver to check on fare payment isn't ""catering""?",Positive
"let's have an analogy. let's say a kid goes to the swimming pool, and his mum brings him there. the mum loses sight of the kid, and next thing you know he's floating face down in the pool. but here's the twist: there's a lifeguard supposed to be on duty at that pool, and he was goofing off at that moment. if he had been at his post, he would have easily saved the kid. whose fault is it?the immediate fault is that of the lifeguard. that was his job and his responsibility. if he had been at his post as he should have been, nothing of consequence would have happened! whether the mum should have done this or that is beside the point. when people carelessly cause their flat to catch fire, and the fire department doesn't show up because they were all goofing off, nobody is going to say ""well the stupid people shouldn't have caused their flat to catch fire"". unless you genuinely think checking on people paying bus fare isn't part of a bus driver's job.",Negative
"just to share an alternate viewpoint:my son also has autism. he has a certain routine he likes to stick to - when we go out to a shopping mall for example, we must walk back exactly the same way we came, otherwise he starts having a meltdown. from my understanding of autism, even a slight deviation in routine requires them to mentally prepare themselves ahead of time. i'm not saying this is exactly what happened in this incident, but it is also possible that even just going back inside the house may not be 'acceptable' to the boy.",Positive

"lack of empathy.i understand people are pissed with her sense of entitlement, but she raised an issue about caring for kids with special needs which is legit, although her suggestions are not well thought off. maybe a better one will be to suggest the bus drivers to notice any suspicious people around and alert it to the control room/",Positive
"just as the mom allowed the child to step out of her sight, are people honestly expecting bus drivers to be that watchful? are bus drivers to be blamed whenever this happens? in this case, it's ridiculous that any blame is even shifted in that direction. there will always be people who somehow manage to go under the radar. that's why there are random bus conductor checks.do note that there was no confirmation that the child was given a free ride(or noticed), the mom assumed that as a possibility and wrote her post based off it. people are quick to play the blame game, that mom need to put padlocks on her gate and secure her keys. put a gps watch on her child so she can track him easily. see, i made an baseless assumption on her security, i can now write an entire self righteous post about how such parents should have tighter measures when they have children with special needs in their house.she's running off on possibilities with little merit. when your foundation is off, it distorts the message that is being said. what's funnier is that she inferred from the entire incident that people who did see her child were not helping him, as if a child taking a bus on their own is an abnormality or that those people and bus driver are not compassionate beings.",Positive
"because tone matters. how you present the information, and your attitude matters. acknowledging that you made a mistake, even an excusable one, while requesting for society to help will be received and treated very different from what seems to be interpreted as complaining/demanding responsibility from people with no actual obligation towards your situation.",Neutral

"i understand what you are saying, and i certainly didn't like the attitude of the woman whose son was pulling car handles (the story i linked). but i'm really puzzled at the outburst here on reddit in this present case. she is asking a valid question: how did the boy get onto the bus when he does not have any means of paying for it? from my own experience taking public transport, bus drivers don't really seem to care whether people tap their cards. i just read the letter again, and i really don't see ""attitude"" in it. maybe it's just me, and i tend to weigh the scales in favour of people with children with difficulties, but i remain puzzled at the anger towards her.",Positive
">but here's the twist: there's a lifeguard supposed to be on duty at that pool, and he was goofing off at that moment. if he had been at his post, he would have easily saved the kid. whose fault is it?you have a terribly flawed analogy. a lifeguard's primary job is to ensure the safety of those swimming. a bus driver's primary job is to drive to the bust on the designated route. unlike the lifeguard, it's not his main focus to screen the passengers to see if they belong on the bus or otherwise.you're also talking about vastly different contexts. surely you can see the difference between a lifeguard overseeing an open pool versus a bus driver monitoring many passengers trying to board a very crowded bus during morning peak hours.>the immediate fault is that of the lifeguard.nope, the immediate fault is that of the mom who lost sight of her kid. the mom only has **one** kid to look after, yet somehow we're holding someone else more accountable even though he has vastly more people to look after? come on already.",Positive
"if that's what it takes. the kid already has a history of getting lost, plus apparently the mother cannot take responsibility for herself  and can only blame bus drivers for 'not paying attention'.",Positive

"yup. and the reason why internet arguments tend to be more frustrating is the lack of body language and (vocal) tones. it's more difficult to convey your intentions, and what you type can be read in any voice depending on the reader's presumed idea of what you're trying to say. it's quite interesting actually. i can reply to someone on reddit who is getting down votes and effectively write the same thing as he did, but in a different manner and get up votes instead.",Positive
"it can be hard to get the child back into the house. most people with autism have to stick to a routine, else they will have an epic meltdown. so you can't ask him to go back into the house nicely when he's supposed to have already left the house and was going to the bus stop. it will mess up his routine and he will get very very very upset (screaming, hitting, kicking etc). yea i get that a child having a meltdown is still better than a missing child, but at that point maybe the mum just wanted to take a chance and grab the book real quick :(",Positive
"frankly, i'm quite surprised everyone thinks it's hunky dory that a kid gets to go on a bus without paying. of course bus drivers won't know whether the kid is supposed to be taking a bus or not, but no one is supposed to ride on public transport without paying, surely?now just to indulge the two minute hate against the mother, we're saying it's okay for a bus driver to give a free ride?",Positive
"> so, let me get your stance clear: bus drivers don't need to make sure passengers are paying bus fare?please read. it's not their primary job unlike that of a lifeguard's who main focus is the safety of the swimmers. this is why your analogy is flawed.>i'm not saying the way things are arranged currently on the bus makes it easy for bus drivers to do so, but you, together with so many other people, seem to think that in principle bus drivers don't need to check fare payment.of course they do. but between focusing on the road and the bus being completely packed, it's completely understandable of a boy of a small stature manages to slip pass without paying. no reasonable person would actually blame the driver given the context. people are simply pointing out that it's a complete cop out for the women to not acknowledge any responsibility on her end, especially since it would be infinitely easier for her to monitor one child versus a bus driver who has to look out for hundreds of them.>we hold them responsible because it is their job. please don't say ""it's the job of a mum to look after the kid"".it actually is the job of a parent to look after their kid, which is why we're holding the mother responsible too. what a silly argument.>if a kid wanders away from the mum and into a gang-infested area, and gets beaten to death by gang members, are we going to say, ""oh it's the mum's fault..."".it is the mother's responsibility if the kid wanders off, why wouldn't it be? a tragic ending doesn't absolve her of that.",Negative

"you know, if the bus driver had wanted to pay for his fare, good for him. but the bus driver should have asked him where he wants to go, why he doesn't have his card, etc. and then realised that something's off about the kid (remember, he's ""non-verbal""). the point right now, which all of you are stubbornly refusing to see, is that bus drivers should be checking if people are paying fares. now, whether it's hard for bus drivers to do that right now is another issue which should be discussed. if it's hard to do, then they should be helped to do it. but all of you are simply, no, not bus driver business at all.",Negative

"many things. the fact that how buses, and public transport in general, being such a significant part of our lives, we should at least appreciate them in some form.i love riding buses. to me its a form of relaxation, to just do nothing and sit and watch the world go by. from an enthusiast's perspective, that feeling when you are chasing a particular occurrence - e.g. last day of service of a particular model, special appearance of a model on a particular route. the sense of accomplishment when you document it. i also enjoy reading about bus ops, scheduling... the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. as an enthusiast, i am able to observe things that regular commuters don't necessarily see, and as such view things like service disruptions, long frequencies a little more bearable, to a certain extent. (i do, however, think that our operators still have much to improve on to provide truly world class service) ",Positive
"dear gauntfallow,thanks for the interest and support towards us enthusiasts. our videos are mostly just to document the daily happenings on public transport, but i'm really touched by this. it's these little things that make the hobby worthwhile, knowing that sometime, somewhere, we may be able to make an impact on others' lives (:",Positive

"hi,yes they are. buses have a statutory lifespan of 17 years, which can be extended to 19 (19.5 maximum). the original superbus, the aircon leyland olympian, has already been retired. its successor, the volvo olympian (basically volvo bought leyland and continued production of the olympian) are in the process of retirement. one particular trivia - one of the leyland olympians in our fleet is the last leyland chassis ever to be produced in the whole world. that bus is now preserved by a uk based enthusiast, and is (i believe) the only leyland olympian not scrapped.there are other buses undergoing retirement as well.from sbs 1) volvo b10ms - basically, almost every non-wheelchair accessible single deck sbs bus is a volvo b10m, apart from a few cng volvo b10bles found mostly in the west. 2) sbs transit's mercedes-benz o405s were also retired a few years back. theyy have different bodywork from their smrt counterparts and are also older, with different gearbox. i don't have much memories of them as an enthusiast though. they retired when i just entered the hobby, but i liked their front wheelarch because i could sit there and pretend to be the driver (was still a little kid then)3) scania n113crb. they were already retired when i came into the hobby, so i have no memories of them. 4) dennis dart. they were the shortest public buses in singapore at time of retirement at 9.4m (standard buses are 12m). mostly found on services 92 and 42, though the 92 ones were retired early, while the ones on 42 served until the end of 17 years.from smrt -1)  mercedes-benz o405s. they're the characteristic boxy buses that you see on almost all smrt services. believe it or not as robust and as modern as they look and feel many of them are approaching 17, 18, 19 (the oldest) years old. their bendy variants are also getting retired. they're a bit younger at 17, but with the new double deckers coming in and lta's (and probably the public) stance towards bendies, they have not received any lifespan extension. 2) the scania l113crl, its retirement was quite recent in fact, just last week. they're the ""old looking"" buses that used to be found on routes 178, 187, 852, until their progressive retirement started this year. a different variant of the scania l113crl, the same chassis but a different bodywork, was retired in ~2012. probably the worst ever bus that smrt bought. they also used to be found often on 178/187/852 - they're the dusty, squeaky ""old looking"" buses and their aircon was crap. glad they're gone, but us bus enthusiasts used to chase them a lot because they mostly only appeared on 178/187/852, so any other service was quite the special occurrence. they're actually newer than all the o405s and they retired before their lifespan was up. most likely due to the horrible condition they were in.3) the hino hs3krk and dennis lance. these were also retired early due to the poor condition of the buses - they were about 13~14, maybe 15, at the time of retirement. the hinos were the last japanese bus bought by smrt and were found around cck, the dennis lances were based at ang mo kio depot and served yishun.most buses that are retired end up in the scrapyard - most at kranji, a few at other places. some have been exported to other countries - the sbs transit mercedes-benz o405s have been refurbished, re-engined and rebodied and are now running as public buses in thailand.pics:leyland olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/22193-6/sbs9000s-51.jpgvolvo olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/8732-6/800x600xvo3x-premium-shentonway.jpg.pagespeed.ic.l-sfbdpuly.jpgthe volvo and leyland olympians are quite similar on the outside but there's a few notable differences, including engine type on the later volvos, the dashboard, lack of power steering for the leylands (made them very hard to steer) and 2 rear grilles on the leyland instead of 1 on the volvo.sbs transit mercedes-benz o405: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/622-10/sbs3798m-ct8.jpgsbs transit volvo b10ms: they came in several batches with different bodywork. all variants are going off now, some at 17 years and some at 19.http://www.sgbuses.com/d/47-10/sbs694z-99-sbs746h-96.jpg mark 3, retired in 2012http://www.sgbuses.com/d/9670-6/sbs886l-39.jpg mark 4 duple metsec, majority retired, ~40 out of 115 left in servicehttp://www.sgbuses.com/d/2633-8/sbs2631s-156.jpg mark 4 walter alexander strider. some are retiredhttp://www.sgbuses.com/d/2977-8/sbs2795c-15.jpg mark 4 duple metsec dm3500. just started retirementsbs transit scania n113crb: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/334-10/sbs3692j-225.jpg all retiredsbs transit dennis dart -

"yes. a lot. i bloody hate those non adjustable air condition vents. especially when it's blowing cold air in your face on a rainy monday morning. oh. god. i understand it's for easier maintenance or whatever, but still.some of us are into trains. the refurbished trains certainly do look and feel much brighter. i think the refurbishment will not affect pax capacity that much. doing some simple math puts the capacity reduction at ~76 seating passengers, or 4-6% depending on what your definition of ""full"" is. i used 1300 pax a conservative estimate which gave me 5.8%, using the official 1920 pax would give you 4%. however, the refurbishment process has also created slightly more standing room near the doors and newly created wheelchair spaces, which means that the actual reduction would be even smaller. plus it's more comfortable too - the 9 seat per block config was extremely squeezy for me.",Positive
"if you're looking for some trivia i guess the most interesting would be that one of our retired buses sbs9168s, a leyland olympian, is the last leyland chassis to be ever produced in the world, in that factory. it bears a special significance to british motoring history and the people who have worked on the bus. the olympian was one of the best selling leyland models and continued to be produced as the volvo olympian, up till ~2000. it is now preserved by a uk bus enthusiast, bears a new uk registration and runs around in bus exhibitions/shows/rallies/whateveryouwant to call it",Positive

"not op too. 1: the problem is that in singapore: singaporeans hate walking. singaporeans hate heat. having further bus stops means both of that. 2: no idea why they put that island there, but they're removed from many bus stops now. the bus stop near me has visible marks from when they removed that island years back.",Negative

"that bus stop bollard is supposed to absorb the impact in case a bus barrels into a bus stop. its not gonna stop it but at least mitigate its effect. much better than if the bus just crashes straight in. i don't have stats on its actual effectiveness, but basic physics leads me to imagine it would decrease the chances of serious injury/death in case of such an accident happening.",Positive
"not sure what you mean about the pedestrian bridges though - personally i find them quite useful especially when the traffic light is quite a distance away. im more annoyed by traffic lights since it just slows the journey down. overhead bridges provide the solution.not only are the bus stops too small but passengers are also too lazy. often people cannot walk the distance of 1 or 2 buses because the bus is 2nd or 3rd in the queue. they expect the driver to literally stop in front of them.  this further delays the bus(es) behind, just so they can avoid walking a distance of like 15 metres. bus drivers should teach these idiots a lesson by just driving off. until then they will learn that their legs can be used for walking too, not just standing in front of the bus expecting the driver to stop in front of them. the only exception would be for the elderly",Negative

"the same way that planes are differentiated. buses are differentiated more by their bodywork rather than their chassis since that is where most of the differences lie. other methods include engine sounds, gearbox, lights etcfor eg: the man a22 http://www.sgbuses.com/d/45548-4/smb350a-852.jpg has this black structure on its roof which is its distinguishing feature and in fact differentiates it from all other bus types. also all man buses currently in service have the same front headlight cluster and bumper design. another eg: the volvo b10m. in 2011 there were 4 variants of b10m in service. the mark 3, the mark 4 duple metsec, the mark 4 walter alexander and the mark 4 duple metsec dm3500. the mark 3 has a round headlight cluster.the mark 4 is similar to the mark 3 but has a square headlight cluster and the radiator grille moved to the side. also it has a different gearbox from the mark 3. the mark 4 walter alexander strider has a front windscreen that angles inwards.the mark 4 duple metsec dm3500 also has a inward-angling front windscreen, but there is a ""depression"" below the front windscreen where the volvo slash would be. it also has a different gearbox from the wa strider.for smrt eg: the variants of the mercedes-benz o405the ""regular"" o405:some o405 variants originally came without aircon. the aircon was added later. these buses now have yellow tinted windows and roof aircon sets. the o405 variants that originally came with aircon have underfloor air conditioning that is not visible.the o405 volgren has a less ""boxy"" front:the o405g mark i bendy, is obviously longer than the standard o405.the o405g mark ii bendy has a curvy front with ""smiles"" below the windscreen. the front is often likened to the early mercedes-benz citaros.the o405g hispano habit bendy is, well, self explanatory. considerably more modern looking than the earlier two.the o405g volgren bendy has a front similar to the mark ii but there is a lack of ""smiles"" and the headlight cluster is more squarish.there are various other differences too, like interior, gearbox variant which i mentioned, and also registration plate. it may look like rectangular boxes at first sight but when you closely observe them they all have differences. it's like airplanes, you can differentiate an airbus a320 with iae engines and an airbus a320 with cfm engines by hearing the sounds each engine makes. the 787 has its unique wings that sets it apart from the similar 767. the 747-8 has a longer upper deck hump than the 747-400. etc etc etc....",Positive
"most variants of buses have different bodywork, so they look different. you just need to have the interest and the patience to pay attention to the differences. for the very few they are truly very similar: (for example the volgren bodywork on the [hino hs3](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sgtransport/8423892448/) and the [mercedes o405](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sgtransport/10506490666/)), the differences may be as subtle as the different dashboards and steering column, slight interior differences like seat positions, engine and gearbox sounds, radiator locations, and, if you're lazy, the registration numbers.",Negative
"i say it's a mix of poor driving attitude, crappy buses and ""old habits die hard"". the newer buses are much more sensitive on the accelerators and brakes, older drivers may take some time to get used to this. some types of buses - notably the scania k230ub which is the most common ""new"" single bus in sbs's fleet, due to a crappy gearbox and engine that makes the bus hard to drive and jerk very often. others are just drivers with poor attitude who cannot be bothered. our buses are quite powerful actually, the newest purchases output between 300-360hp depending on type of bus and engine.",Negative
"the longest smrt bus service would probably be 858, from woodlands to woodlands, looping at changi airport. one trip is 3 hours long and covers  73.3km. non-loop, it would be smrt bus service nr1 at 43.2km.by time, again it'd be 858 at 3h per trip. non-loop, it should be sbs 51. however several of the longer routes can have very long trip times especially during the peak hours e.g. 10, 14, 30 etc. they have stretched outwards of 3h too.",Negative

"the newest buses being bought now are all complaint with euro v emission standards: https://www.dieselnet.com/standards/eu/hd.phpbuses come with technology like selective catalytic reduction (scr) which converts nox into n2 and h2o, through diesel exhaust fluid adblue (aqueous urea). others have exhaust gas recirculation (egr) systems which feed already combusted exhaust gas back into the engine, lowering combustion temperature and producing less nox as a result. both have their advantages and tradeoffs, but i think that scr is more suited for the singapore environment. egr lowers engine performance which is not very suited for city buses' frequent starts and stops. scr on the other hand utilises a much simpler concept reducing the need for maintenance.more reading:https://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/exhaust-gas-recirculation-egr/https://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/selective-catalytic-reduction-scr/we have also trialed alternative fuel source buses in the past, including a couple of hybrids (sunlong and zhongtong hybrids come to mind) and a hydrogen fuel cell bus that was supposed to go into service but never did. the former was apparently a headache for maintenance staff and had problems keeping schedule, which was why they were removed and sold off after some time.",Negative

"the tridents are not that new, they were introduced in 2001 so that makes them about 13 years now. this is a very comprehensive read: https://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/dennis-trident-3/i don't really like the man though. the design is nice but the bodywork is of very cheap quality (it is made from a certain company up north) - listen to the amount of rattling. also it is not quite well maintained. the citaros are much better, but i imagine in europe their standard is even higher. their bodywork is much more robust and of much higher quality than the man.that is a volvo b10m variant as well, specifically the mark iv duple metsec. it was the longest rigid bus at 14.5m, with a tapered rear for easier turning. it was initially on trial as part of plans for high capacity buses, but it didn't really work out since no more were ordered. it's probably due to the long distance between the doors creating inconvenience for pax (especially the ones at the rear), and the increased length making it difficult for the drivers. that bus also used to ply service 174 in its initial years... after its stint on 62 it was redeployed to 83 in sengkang where it served until its end of lifespan at 17 years. sbs originally had 2 bendies, a volvo b10ma (this also had a tapered rear because it was longer than average bendy buses) and a mercedes-benz o405g. yes they indeed did svc 18 before. i never had the chance to ride them - they were exported to new zealand, i'm not sure if they're still running though - they should be getting quite old already.i really love the non a/c buses too - without the a/c they are just so much more powerful, even more when certain buses have no speed limiter. really enjoyed my last rides on them in the jurong industrial area before their retirement in late 2012. i'd kill to get some of those back!yes smrt is phasing out their bendies... like i mentioned above the mark is are already undergoing retirement. if you hang around kranji enough you may see one getting towed to the scrapyard, with doors open, smrt logo removed, sometimes windows broken, it's quite a sorry sight because just a few days earlier those same buses were still in tip top condition carrying pax. they're all going to be replaced by double deckers, the only remaining bendy would be the demonstrator bus smb388s, delivered in 2013 now plying svc 190. it was intended as a one-year trial for its particular model, to date no more have been confirmed but there are rumours flying around in the community of 40 more buses as a one-to-one replacement of the mark is. even if they are brought in, they will probably be deployed on feeder routes, with the double deckers on the longer trunk routes..",Positive
"lta does not generally like bendy buses, as they take up more road space. smrt has commented that they will purchase more, and made a few comments about how they plan to deploy them alongside the new double decks. in general, i expect to see bendy buses in short-distance high-capacity routes (like feeder services), and less on longer-distance trunk services.",Positive
"we'll have to go into the pros and cons of bendy buses vs. double deck buses. bendy buses:  pros: faster disembarkation due to 3 doors. slightly higher capacity, standing allowed throughout. can run almost all routes due to the articulation, which makes them rather flexible.   cons: takes up more road space: rigid buses are usually 12m, bendy buses are 18m. blocks traffic and uses more of the bus stop length. double deck buses:  pros: more seats. has the same footprint as a single deck rigid 12m bus.  cons: slower disembarkation: between the stairs and the exit door is a usual bottleneck. less standing room. can only be assigned to fixed, approved routes due to height and clearance. lta has to consider factors beyond just public transport: they also need to factor the effects on other road traffic. does the advantages of bendy buses outweigh the additional footprint? we don't know for sure the reasoning, for they're probably a combination or all of the above.",Negative
imo: bendy buses take up more road space in land scarce singapore. double decks can carry the same amount of passengers but require less space hence they are more suited for singapore roads. however bendies have a faster boarding and alighting time due to more doors and thus would be more suitable for shorter feeder services.,Positive

"here's one fact: sometimes at night, apart from the off service buses, you'll see very irregular buses running with service numbers like eb10, or wt1. those stand for ""employee bus"" (sbst) and ""worker transport"" (smrt), and are internal bus services that ferry employees after operation hours to, from, and between bus parks and depots. they don't operated on fixed routes though, so it's even harder to specifically look out for one unless you wait around the depots. edit: i don't really know about the behind the scenes, but it involves returning to depot, refueling, cleaning, and maybe driving off to park for the night at the bus park (which are sometimes away from the depots).",Positive

"since this is an ama, i will answer everything as honestly as possible. most of this is restricted to the younger/newer enthusiasts, i myself was like that when i started off but now that i am older i understand the consequences of my actions and stick to safe places to get my pics.* running around the bus interchange. i get it if you're running for the bus but don't run all over the interchange, all the time, shouting at one another. people think you are crazy and you are just a hazard to others. * running around the road. i see people standing on the centre divider snapping buses all the time. the more atrocious people stand on the middle of the road. *the middle of the bloody road.* i cannot comprehend how they have the guts to do that because i will certainly not risk getting hit by a car for a photo of a bus that is likely to come back an hour later in the opposite direction.* screaming and shouting. this, honestly, isn't reserved for only bus enthusiasts, but youths in general. i find most don't know how to conduct themselves appropriately on public transport, and it is very irritating. i'm a natural introvert that hates loud voices so it's even more irritating for me. as an enthusiast, however, i would imagine they know public transport etiquette.* disturbing the driver and taking advantage of him. this is mainly restricted to the younger enthusiasts but leads to horrible consequences. there was a particularly high profile incident on the last day of a particular bus service; the driver was an extremely friendly and helpful person who has been complimented numerous times in the past. a few people took advantage of her kindness and tolerance towards enthusiasts, spent the entire trip at the entrance door talking to her, disturbing her and being a nuisance to passengers. the company found out and she did receive some form of penalty, because nuisance enthusiasts cannot control themselves. some other enthusiasts have also been known to take advantage of nice bus drivers to get free rides, rides on off service buses etc.... that is putting the driver's ricebowl in danger for their own gain. how selfish and how disrespectful. **idiots**.* flamebait. politics is rife in our hobby, as for the current situation i think it is rather peaceful. there are many factions within the community, and so far efforts to unite them have been rather futile due to vastly different ways of thinking. usually nothing happens, but every now and then some idiot will try to aggravate/wrongly accuse other parties leading to flamewars and shit. and the way they treat the mentally impaired members of the community is downright disgusting. i'm not even requesting you help them, assist them in everything. the very least you can do is to leave them alone. i personally am not a professional and i find it hard to communicate effectively with others so mostly i do not interact much with these people, but it pains me when people make fun of their condition and repeatedly abuse them. yes having a mental impairment is not an excuse, but we still have to show understanding and accept them for who they are. it shows a lot of who they are as a person.",Positive

"reddit hasn't been nice to you but i will echo your sentiments because this system did not critically consider this:**my reasoning is simple why should someone with disabilities make it visually obvious when ones medical condition is private.**this intentionally imposes a certain expectation of the disabled. my friend who has a slip disc may still be able to stand or sit or move around. what if this said friend wears the sticker, got a seat, and later walked down the escalator reasonably? what would the people around think? they would impose their expectations of him standing on the left or taking the lift, and possibly thought he or she gamed the system. (sure, the counterargument is that you can put on and take off the sticker, but then if you put on the sticker at that point in the mrt, because you needed a seat at that time, then what? it imposes an explanation to the person giving up the seat as well. ""why do you need to seat? what injuries do you have?"")beyond that, this sticker has a lot of problems drawing distinctions of able-disabled binary where we should look beyond that and give to those in need. lta is purposefully drawing this line within the public transport spaces with the social good in mind but without considering other social factors.in addition, socially engineering this is not going to help, especially when intersectionality of age and disability has not been considered: i wanna see how a young person with sticker compete with the middle-aged and elderlies without stickers.",Positive
"then i put the question to you: how should your friend - or any other person, for that matter - signal that they need a seat if and when they really need one? expectations are going to be imposed nonetheless.",Positive
"the answer is simple but not easy: to remove the categorization altogether beyond able-disable binary. essentially, it means when you give up this seat to this person, the schemas of the disabled and its current nuances are not used for or against the person. the difficulty (or ridiculousness of it, for most people) is that ""how can this be possible?"". but by allowing stickers, you reinforce that notion. so while not having stickers has its own issues, it's by far leading to the desired direction in the bigger picture.it gets a lot more theoretical (not that it does not impact reality), but i think the point isn't so much for us to deconstruct and reconstruct a whole reality at this point. what we want to see is whether lta has considered these medical ethics and social implications when pushing this idea instead of going ahead just to fulfill someone's improvement kpi and favourable performance index.",Positive

i thought the government will save this for the national day rally to prepare for elections.,Neutral
"agreed! they tend to do really well on the economic dev side (see jurong island, harbourfront shipping redev, changi etc). it’s not so much the abandonment of rationality as it is sticking to the same principle of efficiency when deciding social issues. for example, singapore has a much better abortion coverage system than many other “progressive” countries. that doesn’t mean the government is progressive, it’s only a coincidence because it’s socially efficient to allow abortions.for the record, i hard disagree with the government’s stance on many social issues as well. i just wanted to point out that as far as underlying principles go, keeping 377a is a matter of efficiency (in this case avoidance of friction and public outrage) to them. whether it’s justified, however, is another discussion altogether.",Positive

"well, it's safety vs practicality. i'd go with safety and for the booster seats no need a big fat ones but a simple ones like currently used by phv can be equipped in taxis too. if not, then make it clear to the public that taxi/phv comes with no 'safety' and you choose to bring your own booster seat or go without safety :|",Positive
"i remember the bus that goes to ntu (179 i think?) has godlike frequency even during non-peak hours, you can easily see one every 3-5 minutes.then there are buses like 858 which never ever seem to have seats, while also having long frequency and long queues :|",Positive

"having packed buses is good for them because it maximises profits. on the contrary, having near empty/optimal seating capacity buses (at the expense of more comfortable rides)just doesn’t cut it.",Positive
"these days singapore's buses are divvied up by ""packages"" which are depots and their associated routes. lta specifies the headways and running time of the routes in each package and tenders them out for operators, similar to how tfl does it for london routes.presumably the frequency would be reviewed every now and again by lta, although more feedback for the bus companies won't go wrong since they can highlight issues",Positive

858 is the longest bus service and the entire trip takes about 3 hours. even a 1 minute increase in frequency from 10 to 9 minutes would mean they have to deploy 2 more drivers.,Positive

>facilitates movement towards the exit in case of an accident. ouch. have you experienced many accidents in buses that this became a consideration for you? haha. anyways i tried sitting at a front facing seat today. i was okay until the bus became too crowded for me to stare at the road ahead. can't look to the side also cause of fogging (the a/c is damn cold) + advertisement stickers at the side. i closed my eyes and restrained myself from redditing. giddy but no vomit ! great success.,Positive

"> # no roll-out of on-demand buses as trial reveals higher costs> singapore - singapore will not roll out on-demand buses, which operate like phone-booked taxis, because of higher costs involved.> the land transport authority said on friday (may 31) that a six-month trial of on-demand buses - which plied the joo koon and marina-downtown areas - will conclude on june 15.> during the trial, it found that these buses were costlier to run than regular, fixed-route buses.> ""mileage savings were observed during the trial, but it is currently less cost-effective for on-demand public buses to be scaled up due to high technology costs,"" the authority explained in a statement.> compared to fixed and scheduled bus services, operated mileage in the same area was 18 per cent lower during the trial, the lta added, noting that this meant fewer buses were required.> but the system ""is currently less cost-effective"" because of ""high software development costs"".> ""larger-scale deployment of on-demand public buses is expected to become more cost-effective in the future when the efficiency of algorithms improves,"" the lta said.> related story what you need to know about on-demand public bus services> the system would also become more efficient when driverless buses are ready, it added.> more than 26,000 rides were booked during the trial to date. and according to an lta passenger poll, about half of those who were aware of the scheme had tried it. but there was also ""a significant group of commuters who were either not aware... or chose not to try it"".> the latter group said regular bus services provided greater certainty. they also felt uncomfortable with using a mobile application to book a bus ride.---1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)",Positive

"thank you for your explanation. i can accept it.in any case, the article's thrust seems to be pinning the blame on development cost by sayings it's high, instead of giving more context like you. the development cost cannot be said to be high or low, because there is no comparison to development costs by other vendors (higher than what thing?). if it must be high, then the take up rate should be said to be low(er than hoped).",Positive

"peak hour is a function of user behavior, and is not something that arises from a common definition of ""public transport"". unlike mrts and a lesser extent buses (who get bus lanes), taxis share the road with private cars, and so the taxi peak hour is more related to peak hour for private cars. if i had to guess - taxi (and car users) experience  slightly delayed peak hour compared to mrt/buses because taxi and car users anticipate a shorter journey as compared to using public transport. so everyone sets out later.",Positive
"just to give one small reason why taxis may have different peak hours. **also, this is a hypothesis which is valid only for evening and i don't have any actual data to prove it. i could be wrong as well.**i would say people taking taxis and buses/mrt are coming from a different economic background. i would say generally someone   would be higher up in the hierarchy of any organization and an extension of that is they would be willing to pay for a taxi ride from my personal observation i would say the higher your position, the later you work in office. leaving late from office you may be willing to take a taxi instead of bus/mrt which may account for different peak timings in the evening.",Positive

"cos you look at smrt which has both mrt/bus and taxi but the peak hour for both is different. not only does taxi is able to maximise profit by having longer peak hours, the mrt/bus's shorter hours also reduces cost for them as they only need to have more services for a shorter period of time. if you consider the demand for public service transportation as a whole, shouldn't it be going up (peaking) at roughly the same time? if they justify that after 6pm onwards, people are going home so there higher demand(peak) for taxis. shouldnt the mrt/bus demand is also be higher(peak) and hence consider their peak as after 6pm and be held to a service level of lower frequency after 6pm accordingly? but right now their peak is only 1700 to 1900.",Positive
