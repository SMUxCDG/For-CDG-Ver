how the fuck is she so strong? i actually experienced first hand what its like to get trapped between mrt doors when i was rushing for the train during my sec sch days like 7-8 years ago.  half my body stuck outside and i legit used all my strength and still couldnt pull the doors apart until they opened automatically 10 seconds later.,Positive
never understood why the aunties are all like kan cheong spiders on the mrt. what‚Äôs the hurry?,Neutral
why does this make me irrationally angry?,Negative
"the moment she got stuck between both doors. facepalm. she's very lucky, we've seen mrt moving off 3-4 seconds after closing. as you can see no amount of safety can stop someone who wants to put themselves in danger.",Positive
"the station doors will lock after closed fully. she is lucky the train opened for her, because if it didnt she would not be able to manually open the station door via the lever as it is behind her",Negative

fucking hate these kinda people. on a daily basis people try to rush in when train door is closing or squeeze in when it is already crowded,Negative
"well, if this keeps up we would eventually see mashed tomato smeared across the platform doors one day...",Neutral
"wtf i've seen aunties rushing in just before the door closes but not after the fucking door closes and then prying it open. like wtf, what's so important that you can't wait 5 minutes for the next train and you have to risk your life and other people's time?",Negative
she should be fined for causing delay and possible harm.,Neutral
she‚Äôll be safe if there was a zombie apocalypse,Positive
"in one of those mr mystery books there was this scene where these 2 people were hiding either a dead body or treasure and had to transport it via the train and they made this elaborate plan and all and they stated the train doors would be open for 40 seconds. smart me thought mrt=train and i decided to test it out too. everyone went inside while i stood outside counting to 40 but then the doors started to close and i freaked out and rushed inside, obviously i got caught between the doors and i was just awkwardly looking inside the train with half my body inside the mrt and the other in the playform... it wasnt painful but there was slight pressure( i used to deliberately let lift doors squash me to scare my friends) and honestly i could have opened it too but i was confused if i should go in or step out. in the end, my dad forced open the doors and pulled me out. so basically my dad basked in the glory of being ‚Äústrong‚Äù enough to open the mrt doors while i got scolded for trying to test out a book theory..i stopped reading mr mystery books after that.",Negative

must create a fake news that say one auntie has died from doing this then all the other aunties will be deterred from doing this.but then again might not be effective considering how much satisfaction they get from successfully squeezing through a train door.,Positive
fricking idiot could have died instead of waiting barely a few mins. bitch better be grateful,Negative
one time i was in the mrt and the door was closing and one auntie almost got snapped by the door when that happened in the past singapore didn't have that kind of tec to sense things yet and the auntie would've died if she didn't get through the door lol this shit was like almost,Positive

"apparently she was in such a rush because her sister, the lady in blue that entered the train before her, is her sister that has autism and has a tendency to wander around.  that could've explained her rush to get into the train. source: heard it on the radio-- apparently someone named fabian published a post of fb claiming that he knows this lady.",Positive

"when all the platform screen doors and closed and locked, a green light is shown at each end of the platform. some older nsl stations have a light at the top of the door that turns off when the doors are closed and locked. you can try to observe the next time you are at the platform. if one of the lights doesn't go off, the train will not move, and sometimes the doors will quickly open and then close again, in an attempt to get the doors to close or to release anything possibly trapped in the doors. for the dtl, it is the same. the train will not move off until both the platform screen doors and the train doors have been confirmed to have been shut, but i believe the dtl does it slightly differently. if the platform doors are detected to not be properly closed, but the train doors are closed, it will only reopen and close the platform doors, which is what happened here. she managed to open the platform doors before they were fully able to close, but since the train doors had already closed, she was unable to forcefully open them.",Negative

"**paternoster**a paternoster (, , or ) or paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. the same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store large amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts. the much smaller belt manlift which consists of an endless belt with steps and rungs but no compartments is also sometimes called a paternoster.***^[ [^pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=wikitextbot&message=excludeme&subject=excludeme) ^| [^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/singapore/about/banned) ^| [^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com/r/wikitextbot/wiki/index) ^| [^source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/wikitextbot)   ^]^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",Negative

"i'm not explicitly wishing harm. there is a consequence for everything which mostly remains neutral.in this case, the consequence of my wife getting sucked into an escalator for not tying her shoes is neutral towards everything. she did not wish for harm and neither did i nor the escalator. it is simply an unfortunate accident. sure, the escalator could have a safety system where it automatically stops when it detects something getting jammed in it, but ultimately, no one person or thing is at fault or to blame.the difference between the escalator example and the train is that one is an accident while one is a stupid, deliberate attempt. you can implement the most advanced safety systems for the former and it will be justified because an accident is mostly out of control and unintentional.what is not justified is implementing the same systems for deliberate acts of stupidity because they are intentional and within the control of the individual.when you say that systems should be in place to protect the safety of people in a situation like this where safety is under their control and a choice, you are indirctly tolerating the act by reducing the consequences of said act. dire consequences should be prevented regardless of the reason of the act, but not to the point where consequence is effectively absolved.how am i wishing harm upon someone when they are putting themselves in harms way?and i would like you to look deeper into the consequences of using technology to combat idiocy. if consequences were to be effectively removed for commiting a dangerous or stupid act, it can send a message that said act is more do-able which then becomes more tolerable. eventually we won't even have to think about any significant risk or consequence, dumbing us down.technology is here to improve our lives, not to perform our logic for is or make up for a lack of it.",Positive

"as much as i'd like to agree or even believe the fact that you know this auntie, i'd still be speculative on this issue myself. it's like the whole saga in hong kong now - you can't just rely on any media or any online forum; you've gotta dig deep into the details, bite every piece of info from different media outlets, solve the whole puzzle piece by piece and start building a perspective of your own. the downtown line (dtl) of the singapore mrt is fully autonomous. if it were the high-capacity lines, i'd believe that the auntie was better off shouting to the train captain and request the train doors be opened again. in this context, knowing that if the dtl is fully autonomous, i'd try and understand why she's desperately trying to open the doors. what happened could be that either one of the sensors at the station (platform screen door sensors, train door sensors, foreign object obstruction sensors, etc) picked up a signal that some one was between a closed - door train, and a signal that the psds were forcefully opened once. the folks at ops control should've seen it, thus opening the doors manually or the system automatically performed the action. as much as the land transport authority (lta) likes to advertise its firendly staff in the public transport sector, the best possible way would be to ask for assistance at the station, with station staff informing the staff at succeeding stations to look out for this certain passenger. this is also what one wrote in the comments, and i totally agree with this solution. it's safe, and it's way better than posing oneself to any immediate risk of safety. what i wanna say is, whatever the auntie was thinking that caused this action, the end result was all we wanted to see - everyone safely living on their lives. it's too late to judge and comment on her actions. it's better if we think about how we advertise and inform fellow singaporeans, travelers and all citizens living in cities with fully autonomous metro systems how to deal with these kinds of citizens in the future. hope i tried to calm some people down here. lol peace",Positive

what an absolute joke. nothing but he/she says...,Positive
"one of the things that pisses me off is standing around laughing when we're in distress. this often leads to us having full-out meltdowns (""tantrums"", although a meltdown is different: tantrums are because an e.g. child did not get what they want and would stop as soon as they get what they want; a meltdown is caused by sensory overload). instead, you should really don't laugh or comment about it at all, or try to comfort the person. be aware that this might get you hit. for me, i think that when i have a meltdown i'd like someone to be there the whole time. that shows me you understand that i'm not trying to hurt you, but that i've been pushed over my limit. another thing that pisses me off is baby talking, or accusations of us having 'puppy eyes'. these are syndromes of autism. we find it hard to react in socially expected ways (making eye contact/ speaking in the correct tone/ ""a indoor voice"".) keep the baby talking up and i will have a meltdown and likely raise hell for you. one more thing: we like to know what's going to happen, so that we can prepare our reaction. i was brought to court last year because my parents signed me up for a social program, and i was shook when i heard i had to be put at the boys' home for a month. that made me have a meltdown against the police, because up to then i only knew a bit of why i had to go to court.edit: also check out /r/aspergers if you want. i'd say, through:tl;dr we are siao because you call us siao. don't kaypoh, know that we have our problems and that we cannot perfectly socialize with you, and don't laugh at us for that.",Positive

that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking too. for example ang mo kio station is already over crowded and we want to make it more overcrowded? although it‚Äôs a less advantage to me but i‚Äôd rather they have the light green line pass through yio chu kang so that to veer away the crowd. amk is too close to another interchange- bishan,Positive

"i definitely find your curved version easier to read. it's much faster to focus on parts of the map, because the circle line and cross island give the map a central focus point, for other elements to attach to and come out from / go in from. in art theory terms, the oval circle line creates an identifiable shape that directs focus and attention - something that the non-curved version lacks. in feng shui terms, the curved version has better feng shui.",Positive

"cool, thanks !",Positive
"bishan station is just poorly designed. everything is cramped into a small area. the platform to the northbound is super cramp for the amount of traffic it receives, it was the plaform for the original station. southbound side is much better as it has a lot more space. the circle line side is slightly better but needs to be slightly bigger and absolutely needs to have the trains run on time otherwise it literally a sea of people. the bus stop on ground level needs to be longer so it can accommodate more people alighting from the bus, given how popular the station is. 2 buses at a time is not enough when you frequently have 5-6 busses. the private busses also use the same bus stop as well, adding to the problem.here's the real kicker, the taxi stop in front of the bus stop and how the road connects to the major road between toa payoh and bishan. the road is full of cars. there's simply way too heavy traffic there.",Positive
yeah but the most useful version of this map is that tiny sticker that they put at the corners of the carriages otherwise google maps would supercede this.i think the only time people look up this official map online is whenever someone who needs a reminder on whats coming in the future rather than a daily driver like the sticker version,Positive

"yep, bishan is poorly designed. i don't know if there's even space to expand it or enhance it. can't remember which side is the smaller platform, don't use it often enough. for the peak traffic it receives, i think the connector (between ccl and nsl) should be wider, and yes, if there's a train breakdown or delay, it's chaotic there (ccl especially, though nsl northbound at after work hours is bad too). bishan and je are my personally ""hated"" stations.",Negative

the thing is that the whole ui looks like someone‚Äôs fyp project. the font is some times new roman kinda thing. the pictures of landmarks on each station doesn‚Äôt help. i don‚Äôt need picture slideshows of buildings. i already have my phone. it‚Äôs best that the whole ui gets a huge revamp. perhaps an eta to when you‚Äôll arrive to the next station etc. the only decent thing is when they show where are the exits of each stations located and where are the escalators. that is also if you‚Äôre damn near the screen. i hope they‚Äôll change it up soon enough.,Positive
"honestly, as someone who barely goes out to other parts of singapore,the screens are useful for navigating my way around by showing the buildings outside each exit as well as the floor plan showing where each exit is at (problem is,it shows up a few seconds before the door opens with so many clumped up words and it goes by too quickly to read carefully) so that i can be at ease that i'm not gonna be lost.however, i do also agree that the previous mrt trains with no digital screens are better in showing the train stations on the train lines. it helps to gauge how long the ride is going to bein general, 4/10 for navigation because the exits things don't always show the places i need to get to and only showing the layout for like 10 seconds or something, 2/10 for showing all the stations on the line.",Positive
no i just take the train.,Neutral
the mrt screens should display a geographically accurate version of the mrt map (specific to their line) in my opinion. i don't want a straight line that doesn't accurately represent the distances between the stops (jurong east - clementi is an example but there's also one near khatib) and i feel that the simple layout isn't enough. i understand that this isn't as much of a problem on the downtown line but it still annoys me nonetheless.,Positive
"i feel your pain. the usability design of the station signage and in-carriage displays leave a lot to be desired. it's like the designers of the system didn't even bother to test their solution in the real world.station names that aren't easily visible from inside the cabin and signage that focuses on the direction instead of the station names.""welcome aboard"", ""next station"", etc - too many useless or redundant words. the slow scroll speed exacerbates the flaws too.",Positive
"i analyzed their screens and there are many ux and ui flaws. i am in one and i can think of these.1.	when stationary: it shows your current station and a static map. no way to know which direction the train is going.2.	when moving, it shows the next 4 stations animated and an advertisement. again no way to know if you are3.	when reaching a station, it shows a technical drawing of the station and an advertisement. no way to know where this door is in relation to the outside station.4.	when outdoors, the sunlight blinds the map.5.	when at an angle, it becomes an effective mirrorit looks like they just jumped on the digitalization drive hastily and missed out a lot of the potential benefits that a display could have provided. a quick and dirty example is - at city hall / raffles, telling you where the opposite lines go towards.",Positive

"history repeats itself, like long time ago when smrt ceo decided to focus on advertising and property management instead of public transport because it brought in profits for shareholders.",Negative
"agreed. i think the layouts, landmark infos, things that are around that station could be useful, but all that is just fluff and should not overshadow all the things that are absolutely necessary. commuters need to know which station they are currently at, and which station is next. im sure we're all sick of having to bob our heads left and right, looking out the window to find out what is the current station. if it does not firstly fulfil what is 100% necessary, then its a failed design and is useless, no matter how much more you put in.",Negative

"the light-up lines on the newer northeast line trains are fantastic. it's basically the old physical map but every stop lights up green, the next stop blinks red, and stops that it has passed already have their lights off.",Positive
"what they should have done instead is create a digital version of the led-lit board. the two screens are definitely capable of that if they can stretch it across both of them.i agree with you, things like showing the attractions, attraction photos and emergency exits are pointless. firstly, there are already signs in the station to guide you to your destination after you have exited the station. secondly, the emergency exits is a half-done job. in japan, the train displays to you which cabin you are currently in, and points to the closest exit. whereas for this display, they merely show you the entire train, and just ""show"" you where the exits are. how do you know which cabin you are in? you would still have to orientate yourself with the train on the display, which is incorrect half the time.  2/10. a great concept, but executed so poorly that makes it such a huge missed opportunity.",Positive

"not only that, the design of the digital screen looks rather amateurish and made by a primary school kid. for example, the closing doors animation looked like it was made with a flash game back in 2003, and the font just looks like the default font that is used in microsoft word.personally, the way i would fix this is to essentially make a digital version of the led-backlit board where they show you a station map, and activate the lights on the next and following stations. while it may be practical for customers, the issue is that when a new station opens up (for example, canberra), they would have to redo the backlighting and create new boards for all of them, which is not very practical and also expensive for smrt.thus, this is where the digital display could prove it's worth. the digital version of the old display could be updated easily. new stations and lines could simply be added to the map via a software update. and besides, the display is clearly capable of doing that. they could simply stretch the map across the two screens.",Positive

"that people disagree with the judge's decision does not make her decision *unjust*. when agc decides not to prosecute a sex offence (which does happen), or not to recommend a severe sentence for a sex offence, would the same people still have faith that there has been a just outcome? the law is not meant to bend and bow to shifting public sentiment like a willow, depending on how sensational a case has been made out to be. would it not be best to leave it to the courts to regulate, if it finds appropriate?",Positive
"i agree that no man is above the law.. but no man should be beneath it as well. we should wait for the entire court transcript before we know more. basing it off the news framing by the media is never a wise thing especially since it was newpaper that covered it first. their use of sensationalism to increase page views and readership isn‚Äôt a new thing. again, that‚Äôs why we have the court of appeal but you see the court of appeal can go both ways. see kong hee‚Äôs example where he received a reduced sentence. if there are no checks and balances, agc would have no more recourse after the first judge gives the verdict and it would be final. food for thought: while i believe no legal system is perfect, can i ask where do you think the legal system can improve? should we adopt the jury system like the us?",Positive

"i‚Äôm very sure the reasons would be covered in the appeal at the very least. so if there‚Äôs any misjudgement, it will be brought to light by the appeal.an admission isn‚Äôt admissible unless it has been taken to court and he has been convicted or charged for it. for example, i can go around telling people i robbed a bank but legally it would mean nothing because i wasn‚Äôt charged or convicted of it so i‚Äôm not recorded as a criminal. i think courts cannot use such examples unless they can prove that such incidents did happen beyond reasonable doubt.",Negative
"like i mentioned in my previous replies to other people, i‚Äôm not disagreeing that the sentencing was too light.however i think people need to understand that in any criminal system, punishment and rehabilitation are two very different things. and very often, one impedes the other. i don‚Äôt know why you claim punishments to be rehabilitative when it‚Äôs more of a punitive and deterrent factor. what kind of punishment are we talking about here? would caning and jail time help him more than counselling and actual exposure to psychiatric help(given that he is on probation and will be monitored), even as you so readily admit that there‚Äôs ‚Äúsomething not quite right in his brain.‚Äù because if you punish him too severely, the chances of him being actually able to seek help has just greatly been diminished. prison isn‚Äôt the best place for people to treat their abnormal sexual urges.",Positive
"okay yes i agree with your sentiments but no that is not how the law works. have you ever wondered why sentencing for similar crimes are never exactly the same? this is because circumstances are never the same and all criminals are never the same either. we dont just arbitrarily slap a penalty because we think it is harsh enough to deter. we also have to balance it with many other factors, making it a very subjective judgement because different people have different threshold on what would constitute the most acceptable utilitarian  outcome(for both the perp and the victim). it‚Äôs not as easy as saying someone should do the time if they do the crime. how much time should they do? how much is enough? does it make a difference if they are young? does it make any difference if we think they are able to improve themselves? rehabilitation as a process does not only come after you put someone in jail, it starts when you consider the effect that a particular sentence might have on the individual as well.",Positive

i am really glad that people like you still exist in this world.,Positive
"1) i don‚Äôt know if this is the appropriate terminology used in courtrooms but i do know there is a difference in degree and culpability in different outrage of modesty cases. there is for example, a difference in degree if a victim is touched on the thigh briefly vs the victim is being groped for an extended period of time. i know for most people, molest is molest, but the way the law works is that not all outrage of modesty cases are equal in degree; some are minor and some are major. sentencing has to reflect such differences.2) appeal not to operate as stay of execution41.‚Äî(1)  an appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the decision appealed from unless the court below or the court of appeal so orders.the very fact that the judge welcomed an appeal speaks volumes about her desire for transparency and accountability. as judging from the code above, perhaps there is some legal ramifications between a stay of execution and an appeal that resulted in her decision(anyone trained in law are welcomed to help interpret this decision)3) does it matter if anyone is surprised by the verdict? i know the law minister is also a lawyer, but i‚Äôm not too sure if he is acquainted with all the facts of the case.  at the very least, the person most familiar with the case would be the judge herself, and we should let the appeal court review the case with the full facts. as in every case, there will always be people surprised and whatnot at the outcome. that does not mean that the judge has not gone through due process in delivering the sentence. 4) have you ever considered the fact that the judge could view him as repentant because the perp admitted to his crimes himself. admission of guilt are usually mitigating factors, especially in cases where they have no obligation to admit and could have stayed in the dark without anyone finding out. this coupled with probation, which probably included counselling and other help, could have convinced the judge that the perp was not only willing but also able to overcome his urges.5) you are comparing 2 different case with very different perps. when i talk about precedence, i‚Äôm talking about young students who are adjudged to have a bright future ahead of them. remember nicholas lim? he was let off lightly by the police too. if you scrawl through the nus database, you would see that students who commit sexual crimes face less harsh punishments as opposed to other people. this problem has been here since time immemorial because our system views students in universities to have more rehabilitative potential than anyone on the street. this imo, is the true elephant in the box that should be addressed, not the indiscriminate bashing of judges based on emotive feelings.",Positive

"even if the appeal changes the punishment, it doesn‚Äôt mean that the high court judge fucked up.the judge has to base her opinions on the precedent set by the other courts and based on the powers of her court. if there are similar cases presided over by a higher court with the same/similar verdict. she cannot just say fuck it that higher court is wrong; i can excise my judgement. she will have to follow the precedent set by that court.so there are many factors that the judge has to take into account when she gives her opinion. i am not saying that she is right or that she fucked up. but that's the reason why the courts of appeal exist.",Positive

"you seem to be implying that the emotional impact of manslaughter and outrage of modesty (on the victims) is comparable. and hence the perpetrator should be punished equally for either crime. which is definitely not the case.either way, importance should be placed on rehabilitating the perpetrator, as well as providing emotional support/counselling for the victim, so that at the end of the day, we still have two functioning and contributing members of society.",Negative
"not necessarily. sometimes new evidence come into light that would change the perspective of the whole crime. for example, the victim claimed she was groped in her private parts as opposed to court testimony that she was merely touched. if her claim is true, perhaps sentencing would have to be harsher because it could no longer constitute a ‚Äòminor intrusion‚Äô.i agree with you though, someone didn‚Äôt do their job well. i‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs the judge as their job is to listen to the case facts and evidence to render the verdict. more likely, someone on the ground didn‚Äôt present the facts properly and made the crime look less severe than it appeared to be, if the victim‚Äôs claim is indeed true.",Positive

"agreeing with your point on equal punishment.depending on a myraid of factors including repetition, previous crime history, mitigation factors, etc, their exact jail terms and types of jail class and possible caning would best be titred by a judge.but offenders of serious crimes and sexual offenders should go on a public register after receiving their 1st tier punishment. this would serve as deterrence and also encourage last offenders to relocate in the interest of the victims. this is similar to the concept of how after we jail animal abusers, we further prevent them from being pet owners by decree. while it will be nice if we can rehabilitate the perpetrator, this should not be the onus of the law. the responsibility lies in the perpetrator, who  should live in fear of greater overwhelming punishment should they fail to turn over a new leaf.",Positive

"i see them pretty often at paya lebar mrt late at night. they're pretty aggressive - they even walk alongside people after they were turned down. really they're no better than an mlm - a small faith group starting up needs funding and they get it from your tithes/donations. in certain churches, the status of the recruiters depends on the number of people they manage to rope in. once you agree to attend a session, they bombard you with friendship and there will always be follow up sessions. just like in sales. of cos once you leave, you lose all the friends you've made cos they cut off ties with you. it's just like how cults recruit people. i usually see the missionary mormons in pairs approaching people on the train. not sure if you guys know abt them, but they're always foreigners because they've been assigned to singapore by their leaders. singaporean mormons are in turn sent overseas to recruit more people for the church. it's entirely voluntary and similar to a student exchange. they usually have a recruitment quota to meet that's impossibly high. i find them quite alright, they're pretty polite once you turn them down.",Positive

"> # public transport fares should factor in mrt system‚Äôs rising operating costs: khaw> singapore ‚Äî signalling the need for higher public transport fares, transport minister khaw boon wan on monday (july 8) called for both the fare formula and the next fare revision that is to take place later this year¬†to be reviewed. this is to take into account the rising operating costs of the mrt system.> while he did not explicitly say that fares have to go up, mr khaw pointed out that it would be unsustainable to continue relying on government subsidies to fund public transport infrastructure, adding that subsidies given out ‚Äúhave exceeded their intended scope‚Äù.> mr khaw has said several times before that public transport fares needed to be higher.> in february, he said in parliament that increased costs to improve transport reliability will ultimately be shared by taxpayers through government subsidies or commuters through some fare adjustments.> on monday, he said: ‚Äúas it is, the additional costs have been partly covered by increased government subsidy and partly absorbed by the operators who have been incurring substantial losses. this is certainly not sustainable.‚Äù> the minister's latest comments came in response to mr sitoh yih pin, member of parliament for potong pasir, who asked for an update on the current level of rail reliability and how this will be sustained and funded.> mr khaw delved into the issue of funding after updating the house that rail reliability has improved seven-fold since 2015, with the ‚Äúmean kilometre between failure‚Äù ‚Äî a benchmark for rail reliability performance ‚Äî rising to more than 950,000 train-km as of last month,> efforts to improve rail reliability, he said, have come at a substantial expense to both operators and the government ‚Äî a point he already¬†raised in parliament in february when asked about the government grants and subsidies used to cover operating costs of mrt lines.> mr khaw said that between 2016 and 2017, the total cost of running the rail network has gone up by around s$270 million.> and rail companies are operating at a loss since the fares paid by commuters do not cover operating costs.> in the latest reported financial year, smrt trains incurred a loss of s$86 million, while sbs transit‚Äôs train division also lost tens of millions of dollars.> as for the government, it has spent around s$1.9 billion to take over ownership of all rail operating assets. while this is a one-off move, mr khaw said, the government is now ‚Äúalso responsible for the proper and timely renewal of these assets and this is a huge and continuing financial liability‚Äù.> under the rail financing framework, the government pays for the full upfront cost of civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets, he explained.> subsequent operations and maintenance of operating assets are supposed to be fully paid for by the operators through fares and non-fare revenue such as advertising.> ‚Äúin practice, as fares have been inadequate to cover the cost of operations, government subsidies have exceeded their intended scope of funding the civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets,‚Äù mr khaw told the house.> ‚Äúwith intensified maintenance to reach the current level of reliability, the government‚Äôs operating subsidies have increased further.‚Äù> he pointed out that over the next five years, the government expects to spend s$4.5 billion ‚Äî or nearly s$1 billion a¬†year ‚Äî on operating subsidies. this comes on top of the s$25 billion spending on civil infrastructure to build and equip new lines.> fare formula not strictly followed> mr khaw said that the fare formula determined by the public transport council (ptc) is supposed to keep fares in line with macroeconomic cost factors such as inflation, wages and fuel costs.> the ptc revises public transport fares every year. the fare formula review is typically done by the ptc once every five years, and it was just¬†revised last year.> until recently, the ptc‚Äôs fare formula had not been strictly followed, mr khaw said. if it had, the operators would have been ‚Äúbetter able to cover the costs of the intensified maintenance‚Äù.> mr khaw said that in due course, the ptc will need to review the fare adjustment mechanism to reflect the increased operating cost to support the intensified maintenance efforts and the extra¬†operating subsidies from the government to the mrt system.> in response to today's queries, a ptc spokesperson said that the council will start¬†the annual fare review exercise later this year and undertake a review of the fare formula by 2023.> ""as with all fare review exercises, the council will take into consideration the prevailing developments in the public transport landscape, and strike a balance to ensure that our public transport system is sustainable while keeping fares affordable,"" the spokesperson said.> ""we take the views of all stakeholders, including commuters, taxpayers and operators, seriously in our deliberations.""> though the¬†fare formula now is valid until 2023, mr khaw stressed the need to ‚Äúhave the discipline to implement the formula fully, as we adjust fares over the next four years‚Äù.> he said that for the time being, the government will provide operators with a temporary enhanced maintenance grant, with the details being worked out between the transport and finance ministries.> ---1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) |
