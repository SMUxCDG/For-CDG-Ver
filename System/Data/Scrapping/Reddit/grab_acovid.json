                "comment": "biting the bullet to go against the general sentiment of this thread... but like another poster mentioned, i believe we've got to understand the bigger picture of how grab is doing. for a long time now, they've been rolling out their food delivery subscription service (it used to be $8 for a $5 & $10 voucher + free 30 deliveries with no minimum cost; think it's now $10 for the same amount for vouchers, but 50 deliveries and $10 min cost - pardon me if i'm mistaken, gave up that habit of grabfooding a while back).i used to be some of those dudes who would order a $6 meal (i knew a friend who would order a $3.50 bubble teas) and get free delivery. since grab pays roughly $6 or more to its riders, and still has to pay the hawker/restaurant, you can imagine the loss they must have incurred during this period of time. i believe the main reason behind this move was to take away market share from the other food delivery services like foodpanda and deliveroo, by undercutting their profits (most likely taking a loss like what happened with uber).so #1 we learnt that grab's food delivery arm in the singapore context has probably been incurring losses. and #2 is even if food deliveries see a spike, we must be reminded that grab as a whole is doing poorly in this period of time. i've got a friend who's a driver there and boy, there are legit no passengers at all. and that means less profits for grab too, in the area in which they rely on most.in response to this, they've allowed drivers to too deliver food, which in turn increases the supply of people delivering food, and as you've mentioned... supply & demand. so yeah, i believe these wage reducing measures were already bound to happen, and the current covid crisis might have simply expedited the process. ps. not a grab staff. actually do not like grab (felt their price cutting measures were too mean for my lack of business acumen mind) as i used to ride for food panda but i thought an objective opinion should be shared. on a more important note - stay safe and sane, everyone!"

(short) orders that used to pay a minimum of 5 now pay about 4.5. (long) orders that used to pay ~6.5 now pay about 5.9/6. this multiplied by 12 and reduction of incentives ($10 for 12 deliveries) makes us lose about ~$20 a day from the changes. imagine working full time, this is significant (20*30 assuming working whole month at *minimum* orders is 600 dollars dip in earnings."

                "comment": "> it's not right for merchants to prioritize walk-in customers just because they're physically there.  from my experience working in service positions, i can tell u that i would be much more pressured to answer immediately to the angry and inpatient customer who is there in person, rather than the delivery guy who's sitting around scrolling his phone 90% of the time. it's really not a matter of right or wrong or principles; it is a very simple psychological effect. >customer decides to never order from the restaurant again. restaurant has lost a customer. right and you\u2019ve already answered your own question. it is very very unlikely that every single merchant faced by a food delivery guy will be so inefficient - because it will hurt their profits too. so your argument about next merchant being equally slow whatsoever, moot. ~~the problem is op\u2019s dad did not choose to cancel and move on when op explicitly mentioned that a number of other riders did - in that case, he made the choice to wait that 2.5hr, the \u201clost opportunity cost\u201d is his to bear. i also don\u2019t think any customer would actually want to wait 2.5hr for their lunch, even if it is from dtf. but idk, don\u2019t see op addressing this in his post.~~ edit: op has clarified that his dad was repeatedly given false assurances that the food would be out soon and all that, so i understand why he did not move on and stand corrected.secondly, is it not possible for the rider to just communicate the situation to the customer so that the order doesn\u2019t get recycled to the next rider? so that the customer can make alternative plans? if you, as a grab rider, cancel ur order and don\u2019t bother to communicate the situation to the unknowing customer then i think u r part of the problem. it is highly unlikely that the customer would insist on waiting 2.5hr for their lunch.thirdly, you\u2019re putting yourself into a false dilemma here. you always have a choice. i note that you mentioned the trade off for moving on to the next customer is \u201cwhat if the next merchant is slow ... will affect our incentives\u201d. like i said, it is not certain that the next merchant will be slow and secondly, it\u2019s not like there are procedural issues barring u from moving on to the next order. you can, perhaps at the risk of making less in terms of incentives. there\u2019s no either or situation here. and i don\u2019t take kindly to your implying that i\u2019m ignorant because (you assume) i haven\u2019t spoken to a grab rider before. this is a platform for people to speak their minds. we don't all need to be experts or delivery guys to comment on op's post."

                "comment": "just to clarify, 2.5 hours is the total time my dad spent to resolve this issue. he only waited 1.5 hours at the restaurant, while receiving 1/3 of his orders and proceeded to deliver the only order. however, according to him, because the merchant side did not cancel the order (even though they said they could no cope), his app was stuck on the pending offer, for which he could neither go forwards nor backwards. it also meant he could no longer take up new jobs and there was no option to cancel. other drivers probably could as they only had one order; my dad collected 1/3 orders so he couldn\u2019t go back. he had to drive to the grab hq (after failing to contact support) in order for them to reset his app, wasting even more time, for which the total amount of time spent was around 2.5 hours. hope this clarifies!also i asked him why didn\u2019t he just reject when he was there before the first order was given to him. he told me he didn\u2019t want the order to get passed on to another unsuspecting grabfood driver who may be older and weaker than he is. initially he called the customers who still wanted to wait when the waiting time was stipulated to be 30 mins, so he waited with them, unfortunately it did not turn out that way:("

                "comment": "if the cost of solving the problem is more than what the customer values it at, there is a problem. they lose money because they have high costs. these costs include the talent they hire at huge premiums, cost of providing esops to leaders and staff as well as subsidies they payout specifically to gather market share.as of right now, nobody except those privy to their inner working know how the losses are estimated and how costs are calculated. there are a lot of back door deals which take place specifically to appease investors. like grab consuming the services of companies which are also owned by their investors. for the sake of following the process a rfp exercise would be done but parameters are tweaked such that there are only those suitors left in the race. all companies do it. effectively cash is paid out to these companies and losses booked at grab.also the entire basis of calculating losses is what defines whether they are operational losses or paper losses. twitter till some time back also had losses because it was doling out bucketful of esops and that needs to be paid for.with grab it\u2019s particularly convoluted because instead of doing a ipo where they would have make their inner workings public they chose the spac route where they don\u2019t need to disclose much.also with the 1$ hike it\u2019s a smart move. they may even give out the same 1$ back as a discount but remember the way it gets accounted is that it adds to the revenue (top line) first and then you reduce the operational cost of driver payouts and subsidies etc.illustration - if grab does 500k rides a day in sg for an average price of 6$ it gives it a top line of approx 1bn/year. now with covid their rides fall 30% so obviously the top line would be 700m. so they increase the price by 1$ which now puts the top line at 895m improving it by 30%. it\u2019s irrelevant whether they are paying it to the driver or subsiding it. their only aim to show earnings which determine their valuation. that is also the reason you see a 30c insurance fee and maybe as they want to top line growth in the future they will keep adding more such charges, often taking them off as discounts later. discounts get charged as losses separately.right now grab has a race to show a certain revenue to get the best valuation and listing premium. after that they will rest easy!"

                "comment": "> # former grab driver on trial for attempted rape, sexual assault of 19-year-old passenger> singapore: a former grab driver claimed trial on tuesday (sep 29) to sexual assault and attempted rape of a 19-year-old passenger he picked up from a bar two years ago.> tan yew sin, 46, is contesting a charge each of attempted rape, sexual assault and outrage of modesty, which he allegedly committed on the victim in his car.> advertisement> advertisement> according to the prosecution, tan accepted a booking in the early hours of may 19, 2018, to ferry the victim from wildseed bar at seletar aerospace park to her home.> details of the victim's home were redacted from court documents as she is protected by gag order.> the victim had gone to the bar with her friends the night before and drank about five glasses of beer throughout the evening, said the prosecution.> a friend helped her to book a grab car, and two friends noticed she was tipsy, crying and could not walk straight.> advertisement> advertisement> they helped her to the car, and told tan that the victim was drunk, passing a plastic bag in case she needed to throw up during the journey.> the victim's friend was heard in the in-car camera footage played in court asking the accused to help take her home, thanking him and asking the victim to send a text when she got home.> > the victim lay down in the back seat, crying when tan tried to talk to her, said deputy public prosecutors muhamad imaduddien, chew xin ying and emily koh.> she fell asleep and was woken up by tan when they reached her residence. she alighted but could not access the side gate.> tan led her back to car when she could not enter gate> tan, who is married with three children, saw her looking \"lost and unsteady\", and took her back to his car after she squatted down and began crying.> in statements to the police, tan said that the victim became agitated while in his car and banged her head on the window while crying.> he went to the back seat to console her, and searched her belongings to find out where she lived and took her phone to call someone to get her.> however, instead of helping her home, he began committing sexual offences on her, kissing her before attempting to rape her, alleged the prosecutors.> according to them, tan later drove to a more secluded area and began molesting the victim and sexually assaulting her.> he eventually helped the victim back to her residence and drove off.> for reasons unknown, the victim did not go home and was found by another grab driver at around 4.40am, lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing.> he called the police and waited until an ambulance arrived. the paramedic will testify that the victim was crying and kept struggling when she tried to examine her, said the prosecution. tan's dna was later found in the victim's underwear.> defence likely to argue victim consented> defence lawyers chenthil kumarasingam and adeline goh agree on some facts in the case, including that the victim was crying during the car ride from the bar to her home.> the prosecution will lead evidence from 32 witnesses and tender footage from closed-circuit television cameras and tan's in-car camera.> the footage shows the victim sobbing throughout the car ride, with tan repeatedly asking her what happened and if she had just broken up.> in tan's statements to the police, he admitted that he had not asked the victim for consent, but claimed that she \"participated in some of the sexual acts\".> the prosecutors said tan is likely to argue that he believed in good faith that the victim consented to the sexual acts.> however, they said alarm bells ought to have been raised in tan's mind regarding the victim's behaviour, including her crying, lack of response to his questions, appearing lost and unsteady and that her friend had said she was drunk.> a blood specimen from the victim was later found to contain 26mg per 100ml of blood, with an estimated blood alcohol content at 3am that day in the range of 132.2 to 155.9mg per 100 ml of blood.> the victim's inability to remember events in tan's car may indicate an alcohol blackout, or that she was in deep sleep from alcohol consumption, said the prosecutors.> a consultant from the institute of mental health will testify that the victim was significantly intoxicated and incapable of giving consent to sexual activity, the prosecution added.> when contacted by cna, a grab spokesperson said tan has been banned from grab's platform.> \"our users\u2019 safety is important to us and we have zero tolerance for indecent behaviour, harassment or abuse of any kind. users who have displayed indecent behaviour will be banned from the platform,\" she said.> > the trial continues. if convicted of attempted rape or sexual assault by penetration, tan could be jailed for up to 20 years, fined, or caned.> if found guilty of outrage of modesty, he could be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) |

(support local f&b, guyssss!)2. i have the option to tip the riders too- whyq: good for cbd but seems to be lacking in riders for other areas. long waiting time.- oodle: for more medium to high price restaurants. i use it for special occasions. pretty good experience for the few times i've used it."
