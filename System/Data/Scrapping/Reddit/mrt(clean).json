(and i believe they have done it before)also like most mentioned this is the classic example of adding job scopes and possibly without adding pay, worse that it is a glc.**also if you can't find a child or an elderly it might be wise to invest in a bluetooth tracker airtag or tile and let technology do the work.**"

and bright hill on the future cross island line.> trains along the thomson-east coast line will arrive at stations every five minutes during peak hours and every nine minutes off-peak.> the first train on saturday took about 30 minutes to reach woodlands north station from caldecott.> tel2 was initially set to roll out in the second half of last year, but was delayed due to the pandemic and a review of the rail system software because of a major signalling fault on tel1 last december.> the current stretch from woodlands north to caldecott will benefit about 100,000 households. once completed, the entire 32-station line will cost more than $25 billion, and it will also link to the upcoming cross-border rapid transit line to johor baru.> other early birds on the first train at tel2 on saturday morning were two father-son pairs.> > two of the first commuters on board the 5:50am tel train out of caldecott station on aug 28, 2021. st photo: alphonsus chern> > eleven-year-old eamon kwong and his father, mr adrian kwong, boarded the first train at upper thomson station.> eamon said: \"i wanted to see the train all new and clean. it's like a once-in-a-lifetime moment.\"> watching his son excitedly bound to the front of the train and seeing it zip through the tunnel felt like a blast from the past for mr kwong, 47.> it brought back memories of his first mrt ride in 1987, when the first 6km stretch of the north-south line was opened.> \"i remember when i was a kid, in 1987, taking the very first mrt segment. i remembered how exciting it was, so i thought i would just let him come and see (tel2), and remember this moment.\"> as for the second father-son duo, train lover shion adachi, 14, asked his father, mr kazuhiko adachi, to drive him to caldecott station from their home in clementi.> \"my son likes fast trains. he remembers his first train ride in japan when he was three or four. his passion for trains has stuck with him ever since,\" said mr adachi, 49, who works in finance.> > the stations on the new stretch were designed to be pleasing to the eye, while keeping commuters' comfort in mind. st photo: alphonsus chern> > hailing from japan, shion and mr adachi have been living in singapore for the past six years.> throughout the ride along the thomson-east coast line, shion and other commuters were busy taking videos of the ride and the train's interior.> the stations on the new stretch were also designed to be pleasing to the eye, while keeping commuters' comfort in mind.> some benches at the six stations come with armrests and backrests. the signs at the stations also have larger fonts and simple icons so that they are easier to read. the exits are also indicated by numbers instead of letters.> for the thomson-east coast line trains, each train car has five doors, compared with four on other trains. this allows passengers to alight faster, and to avoid pushing through people when the train is crowded.> > for the thomson-east coast line trains, each train car has five doors, compared with four on other trains. st photo: alphonsus chern> > various pieces of art - including drawings and artwork along the walls and station platforms, and art installations - have been installed at the six stations.> while waiting for their train in upper thomson station, commuters can entertain themselves by looking for 88 drawings of animals hidden all over the station.> at mayflower station, passengers can snap pictures of tiny bird sculptures perched on different parts of the station.> with numerous green spaces and nature trails such as macritchie reservoir and springleaf nature park located nearby, the tel2 stations will make travelling more convenient for fitness enthusiasts and nature lovers.> at the line's opening ceremony on friday, senior minister teo chee hean said tel2 may well become a \"makan corridor\", referencing the eateries near the stations. for example, springleaf prata place - a stone's throw away from springleaf mrt station - is a household name for roti prata, briyani, thosai and murtabak.> mr kwong said: \"a lot of people may get off at upper thomson station today because of the various ways it has been advertised - dining options and nature.\"---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "hi.a few suggestions. (i\u2019m just bored, you don\u2019t have to take this seriously)1. transfer time is very vital in an application like this. transfer time actually vary a lot depending on the time of day (say waiting for train can range from 2-7 mins) and the time needed to walk from one platform to the other. google maps actually calculate this quite accurately, if you give it the time of day. 2. perhaps consider adding an option for walking. can reference this also. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hvxy96/guide_transferring_between_mrt_lines/3. comfort can also be considered. sometimes people rather add a few minutes to their travel time if it means they can sit! it\u2019s quite easy to see which stations have empty trains picking up passengers just by looking at the difference in wait times at the board. one that i used to utilise is the west bound train at tanah merah station, where it alternates between the train coming from pasir ris and an empty train roughly from 0630-0730am. 4. a use case for me will be the shortest travelling time. some people like to reach work early (and save perhaps 10-15 mins in travelling time, and be productive in office)for example, iirc, if you take the first train from pasir ris to paya lebar, you can quickly go to the middle platform to take the circle line towards harbourfront. this saves in waiting time, and being the first few trains, they are much faster than normal trains. 5. an additional feature you can try implementing would be the earliest possible time to reach a certain location. say i want to reach beauty world from tampines in the earliest possible time. what\u2019s the best way?a) take the first ewl train from tampines to bugis, take dtl to beauty world.b) take the first ewl train from tampines to paya lebar, transfer to ccl and take to botanical gardens, transfer to dtl to beauty world.c) take the first dtl train from tampines to jalan besar, walk to rochor, continue taking towards beauty world. tbh, the answer is surprisingly none of the above hehehe. in the morning, a delay of even 10 seconds could cascade to additional 20 minutes to your travelling time! it takes some effort (and fitness) to actually get the earliest possible time consistently. 6. or what\u2019s the latest possible time i have to reach a certain station before there\u2019s no more train for me to get home? this could be something niche, but useful. google maps tends to have vastly inaccurate first and last train times and suggest very long bus routes when mrt is still possible\u2026just fyi, some first/last trains timing published online are vastly inaccurate. best is to stalk the station or read the sign outside\u2026"

(screengrab: youtube/lta)> advertisement> however, foo kept pursuing ro for loans, until kim and ro decided they could no longer reject him. they hoped that agreeing to his loan request would put them on friendly terms with foo and facilitate the smooth progress of train station works.> kim also feared that foo might apply \"time pressure\" on daewoo if they offended him and influence lta's inspections of their work.> the pair also hoped the loan would stand them in good stead to be awarded future lta projects, especially in comparison with other contractors who had not given money to foo.> ro lent foo s$30,000 after foo sent him a text message on dec 31, 2018, saying he needed to raise a sum of money urgently for family issues.> after lending foo the money, ro began asking foo for help in return. he turned to foo in may 2019 after an lta officer inspected the train station worksite and given daewoo a negative score for infringements of safety or cleanliness.> foo said he would help by speaking to lta's group director of safety and contracts. but his intervention did not change the score, and daewoo did not clinch a project on the jurong region line they had put in a bid for.> in august 2019, foo sent ro a confidential screenshot of an assessment by the lta tender evaluation committee, after ro asked him why daewoo had failed in the first stage of an lta tendering process for the construction of tunnels at changi airport.> the corrupt practices investigation bureau caught wind of the corruption and the trio were nabbed.> prosecutors had called for eight months' jail for kim and ro, while defence lawyers asked for a high fine, or three to four weeks' jail and no more than six months' jail in the alternative.> foo is set for a pre-trial conference in june. he faces 36 charges that range from taking bribes from contractors or subcontractors to cheating his colleagues into giving him loans between 2008 and 2019.> the cases for several other co-accused are pending.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": ">just put back the old maps with the lights please.this. the lcd screens are frankly embarrassing. they're so poorly executed - difficult to read, wrong type of display, too reflective, too dim, poorly designed graphics with skeumorphic frivolities interfering with readability and also the information that you're looking for is going to be obscured most of the time because it's on a rotating slideshow. the old led boards were far more useful and you could read them across the carriage, at a glance know exactly where on the line you were. the only potential improvement that the lcd screen could have provided would be a good station map, but even that they screwed up: the screens should have been showing the station map with an indication of the specific train door you're standing by, so you know where on the map you'll end up and which way to go before you alight. like, go right or left to get to the interchange escalators or a particular street exit or whatever. but instead they just lazily show the same mostly useless map on all the screens in the entire train.this fiasco is extra disappointing because singapore's signage standards in the mrt system is generally very good. it's like the lcd screens were done by entirely different and far less competent people."

                "comment": "> # human error compounded mrt disruptions on oct 14: ong ye kung> singapore: an \"honest mistake\" was among the factors that contributed to the disruption of train services on oct 14, said transport minister ong ye kung in parliament on tuesday (nov 3).> services on parts of the circle line were disrupted after an initial power fault affected the north-south east-west line (nsewl).> advertisement> advertisement> the land transport authority (lta) had said in a report of the incident that to restore power to the nsewl, an attempt to draw power from a substation was done - but this was conducted without first isolating the fault. a power supply disruption then occurred on the circle line, which is also served by the substation.> this was a human error, said mr ong, referring to the attempt to draw power from the buona vista intake substation before isolating the fault.> he was responding to questions from three members of parliament - tanjong pagar grc mp joan pereira, bishan-toa payoh grc mp saktiandi supaat and the workers' party's mp for hougang dennis tan.> they had asked about the causes of the disruptions, the lessons learned and whether emergency preparedness exercises are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the relevant teams know what to do in the event of a power failure.> > advertisement> advertisement> \"there are, in fact, many sets of sops to cater to different scenarios, but one thing we have learned over the years is that every disruption is different and unique. so besides being guided by sops, the engineers on duty will have to exercise judgment and make quick decisions during an emergency,\" said mr ong.> > \"i have not been in their shoes and cannot imagine the challenge they are facing. but under the pressure of time and circumstances, the personnel involved made an honest mistake,\" he added.> > \"i have no doubt this has been a major lesson for them, they wish they had decided differently, and they have much learning to share with their colleagues so that such a mistake will not happen again.\"> advertisement> smrt ceo neo kian hong said last week that its employees misread the graphics display and thought that the fault had been isolated when they drew power from the buona vista substation.> the power staff member and his supervisor have been suspended and will be required to undergo retraining and recertification before they can resume duties, he said then.> > a melted 22kv breaker trip coil (photo: lta)> responding to a supplementary question by mr tan on whether lta will look into how rail operators can improve their work processes, the transport minister said that improvements will be made. he emphasised that suspensions are not uncommon as part of the safety protocol of organisations with a strong safety culture.> \"suspension does not necessarily mean we are blaming them or they're being punished because - make no mistake - if there is gross negligence, if there's wilful wrongdoing, disciplinary actions will be taken,\" he said.> \"sometimes it is really a matter of retraining ... self reflect and go back and do better, and share your learning with your colleagues and i think it is a good system to ensure that we keep on improving.\"> > cable faults> > mr ong also said that testing and inspection of power cables will be stepped up. the faulty cables are being investigated, he noted, adding that the results of the forensic examination are still unknown.> he added that there have been four power cable failures along the tuas west extension since 2018, and lta and smrt had earlier expressed their concerns to the supplier alstom.> > \"on other lines, they typically have a lifespan of 20, 25, 30 years so this is a bit premature to have four faults in the last few years, which i think explains why alstom is stepping forward, replacing everything,\" he said.> > giving more details on the earlier cable faults in response to a question by leader of the opposition pritam singh, mr ong said that two failures happened when the cables were first commissioned in 2018. the other two happened this year.> > 22kv cable faults in 2018 and 2020 (image: lta)> \"the reasons for the failures have not been established which is why, given what has happened, we should send them for forensic (examination) and understand the reason why. in the meantime, regardless of the reasons, cables will be replaced.\"> > evacuation of train passengers> mr ong also went into the considerations behind whether to ask passengers to alight from stalled trains and walk along the tracks.> \"safety of commuters is the top priority during service recovery. that is why detraining commuters is always a last resort because to have commuters walking along the track poses risk, especially for those who are elderly or handicapped, and so it needs to be very carefully carried out,\" he said.> replying to supplementary questions by ms pereira and mr saktiandi, mr ong explained that typically, a decision should be made as to whether to \"detrain\" passengers in a disruption, but there are many factors to consider.> \"and then, like that night, there was inclement weather and there was lightning risk. once there's lightning risk, you stop - never put passengers' lives in danger. so you're balancing between these two ... in this case, there was some hope that they could repower, but the repower went wrong.\"> he also said that evacuation on the circle line was faster than on the older mrt lines as it has a side platform where commuters can walk and wheelchairs can be used.> typically on the nsewl, the elderly, the wheelchair-bound and those with mobility issues have to remain on a stalled train until more manpower, including singapore civil defence force (scdf) officers, arrive.> \"if need be, we use stretchers to carry such passengers to the nearest station. the stations are also equipped with battery-powered motorised trolleys,\" he said.> he added that the passengers have to walk beside a high voltage third rail, and they might trip.> \"you got to make sure you disable it - double confirm, triple confirm, quadruple confirm because it is no joke walking next to 750 volts,\" he said.> passengers on a train near kranji on the north-south line towards woodlands evacuated after a power fault disrupted the mrt service on several lines on oct 14, 2020. (photo: julie chan)> the operations control centre has to balance such risks against the discomfort and heightened anxiety of commuters on the stalled trains and as far as possible, it will try to restore power to the trains to bring commuters to the nearest station, said mr ong.> however, 40 minutes into the disruption, the centre concluded that it could not restore power to the system quickly and decided on \"detrainment\", he added.> in all, 6,800 commuters on the stalled trains were brought to the nearest station platform in under an hour, except for 78 people who were trapped because of the bad weather and risk of lightning.> > mr ong concluded that there were many lessons to be learned from the incident, noting that mass rapid transit systems are very complex and when a major disruption occurs, the circumstances and causes are often unique.> \"with the recent disruption, the morale of the teams on the ground has been affected ... there are many honest and hardworking people who have toiled over the past few years to make our mrt services among the most reliable in the world,\" he said.> \"so as a team, we take collective responsibility, not finger point, and we will do our best, close the gaps, address the shortcomings.\"> ---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "i would say it depends on your primary usage! it's best used as a direct point-to-point transportation due to the meter, without any detours along the way. i'm on the premium subscription which is $18/month, but i get 45mins free (33c / min) every month as well, so in fact i'm only paying around $3 per month every month! on my savings, for example a 15min trip from cbd to my house could cost me $12, but using the bluesg meter it would only cost me $4.95! but i'd also have to walk a short distance from the charging point to my house, which i can live with given the huge savings i got. the only downside is you have to have both a car at your starting destination and a parking lot at your destination available, and i would say 40% of the time there are no cars from where i wanna depart, especially in the town area. but i've found it incredibly useful, convenient and cheap when i'm headed to my friends' houses in faraway places like punggol and jurong.if you're looking to use the bluesg to run errands at a few places for example, they currently offer 3hour ($39.90) and 5hour ($49.90) rental packages which is more value for money for the time spent! i've used these a couple of times when i know i'll be on the road for extended periods of time."

                "comment": "> # public transport fares should factor in mrt system\u2019s rising operating costs: khaw> singapore \u2014 signalling the need for higher public transport fares, transport minister khaw boon wan on monday (july 8) called for both the fare formula and the next fare revision that is to take place later this year\u00a0to be reviewed. this is to take into account the rising operating costs of the mrt system.> while he did not explicitly say that fares have to go up, mr khaw pointed out that it would be unsustainable to continue relying on government subsidies to fund public transport infrastructure, adding that subsidies given out \u201chave exceeded their intended scope\u201d.> mr khaw has said several times before that public transport fares needed to be higher.> in february, he said in parliament that increased costs to improve transport reliability will ultimately be shared by taxpayers through government subsidies or commuters through some fare adjustments.> on monday, he said: \u201cas it is, the additional costs have been partly covered by increased government subsidy and partly absorbed by the operators who have been incurring substantial losses. this is certainly not sustainable.\u201d> the minister's latest comments came in response to mr sitoh yih pin, member of parliament for potong pasir, who asked for an update on the current level of rail reliability and how this will be sustained and funded.> mr khaw delved into the issue of funding after updating the house that rail reliability has improved seven-fold since 2015, with the \u201cmean kilometre between failure\u201d \u2014 a benchmark for rail reliability performance \u2014 rising to more than 950,000 train-km as of last month,> efforts to improve rail reliability, he said, have come at a substantial expense to both operators and the government \u2014 a point he already\u00a0raised in parliament in february when asked about the government grants and subsidies used to cover operating costs of mrt lines.> mr khaw said that between 2016 and 2017, the total cost of running the rail network has gone up by around s$270 million.> and rail companies are operating at a loss since the fares paid by commuters do not cover operating costs.> in the latest reported financial year, smrt trains incurred a loss of s$86 million, while sbs transit\u2019s train division also lost tens of millions of dollars.> as for the government, it has spent around s$1.9 billion to take over ownership of all rail operating assets. while this is a one-off move, mr khaw said, the government is now \u201calso responsible for the proper and timely renewal of these assets and this is a huge and continuing financial liability\u201d.> under the rail financing framework, the government pays for the full upfront cost of civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets, he explained.> subsequent operations and maintenance of operating assets are supposed to be fully paid for by the operators through fares and non-fare revenue such as advertising.> \u201cin practice, as fares have been inadequate to cover the cost of operations, government subsidies have exceeded their intended scope of funding the civil infrastructure and the first set of operating assets,\u201d mr khaw told the house.> \u201cwith intensified maintenance to reach the current level of reliability, the government\u2019s operating subsidies have increased further.\u201d> he pointed out that over the next five years, the government expects to spend s$4.5 billion \u2014 or nearly s$1 billion a\u00a0year \u2014 on operating subsidies. this comes on top of the s$25 billion spending on civil infrastructure to build and equip new lines.> fare formula not strictly followed> mr khaw said that the fare formula determined by the public transport council (ptc) is supposed to keep fares in line with macroeconomic cost factors such as inflation, wages and fuel costs.> the ptc revises public transport fares every year. the fare formula review is typically done by the ptc once every five years, and it was just\u00a0revised last year.> until recently, the ptc\u2019s fare formula had not been strictly followed, mr khaw said. if it had, the operators would have been \u201cbetter able to cover the costs of the intensified maintenance\u201d.> mr khaw said that in due course, the ptc will need to review the fare adjustment mechanism to reflect the increased operating cost to support the intensified maintenance efforts and the extra\u00a0operating subsidies from the government to the mrt system.> in response to today's queries, a ptc spokesperson said that the council will start\u00a0the annual fare review exercise later this year and undertake a review of the fare formula by 2023.> \"as with all fare review exercises, the council will take into consideration the prevailing developments in the public transport landscape, and strike a balance to ensure that our public transport system is sustainable while keeping fares affordable,\" the spokesperson said.> \"we take the views of all stakeholders, including commuters, taxpayers and operators, seriously in our deliberations.\"> though the\u00a0fare formula now is valid until 2023, mr khaw stressed the need to \u201chave the discipline to implement the formula fully, as we adjust fares over the next four years\u201d.> he said that for the time being, the government will provide operators with a temporary enhanced maintenance grant, with the details being worked out between the transport and finance ministries.> ---1.0.1 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"
