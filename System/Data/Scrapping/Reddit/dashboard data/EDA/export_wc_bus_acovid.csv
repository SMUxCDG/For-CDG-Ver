bring old double decker open window leh.
driving doors open?
i’m taking longer ride (say 3 4 stops) prefer taking window seat. i’m taking aisle usually carrying backpack heavy reason alighting passengers won’t stand pass window seat. extremely hard squeeze past bag(s) it’s worth trouble i’m taking stops. either stand relatively aisle relatively empty. bit prude awkward squeezing past men don’t stand sit window 😅
sometimes mainly 3 reasons: 1) couple stops. 2) safer sit case truck ramming side. there're bars wall doors. 3) hot sit sunny days. weak aircond hot days help.
"met 1% decided whine paid fare “entitled seat”, politely “excuse me” :/ never again, quietly stand stare. ha.........."
cool east side :(
anyone remembers riding two conjoined black springy middle??
never knew evolve much. levelling double deckers?
