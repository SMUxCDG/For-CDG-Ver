(harassment in public occurs very rarely, based on my observations..so maybe everyone was very uneasy and unsure about how best to react.) i do think there are still, however, opinionated and deeply compassionate people in singapore. as an asian i had experienced racist verbal abuse or unsolicited yellow fever advances several times when i was living overseas; and nobody spoke up or came to my defence...(except one very kind british old man), so i\u2019m sorry to hear. i remembered thinking \u201cmaybe they just saw me as the minority and foreigner, and could not empathise, or they were unable to perceive how uncomfortable i am because of cultural differences\u201d. i know that if i were there and saw your discomfort, i\u2019d have spoken up for you - especially if you were a foreigner"

(if her kids were that insistent)you aren\u2019t in the wrong, but i felt that if you are brave enough (i certainly am not), you could have asked her if she still wanted the seats at the window, as you didn\u2019t notice that she wanted the 4 window seats for her family, and was too caught up in your video to notice. you could have just threw in an empty apology just to lighten to mood if she was mad.this is a way of changing the culture of passive-aggressiveness that we have today in singapore i guess. reading your post made me reflect on what i could do better to improve my reaction towards bad encounters, and make both me and the other party\u2019s lives better, if only so slightly. it takes guts, lots of guts, but i believe if enough people act like that, singaporean society will indeed improve. :)edit: i\u2019m really sorry if this reply stirred up resentment or anger in anyone. it was truly not my intention to incite such feelings in anyone, and i genuinely apologise if you do feel this way. this reply was meant to theorise how both sides could have better managed the situation, and come out of it more positively; and by extension, how singaporean society can change for the better. anyway, i hope you have a good day, and that this reply has not ruined it."

                "comment": "it is good to see several former mechanics cringing at this in the comments at lack of jack stand use.  i was once a mechanic. now i am in engineering management. the problem to me can be traced deeper.  lets start with the why. it is enormously unsafe to work underneath a vehicle supported by jacks. it is almost always hugely unsafe to put humans underneath any heavy load supported solely by a lifting mechanism. lifting mechanisms can back out and drop the load on you. manual floor jacks are designed to be mobile and easy to finely position under a vehicle. the compromise is that this mobility prevents them from being optimally stable. most designs can topple or slip if side forces are applied to the jack or the vehicle. to attain lightness means they typically don't have a fail safe mechanism ( like a brake or ratchet) to prevent you from being crushed if the mechanism backs out.   the other thing about this incident is that there were multiple people who we injured or killed by the bus falling on them. this strongly suggests to me that this obviously unsafe practice is tolerated by the people on the ground and at minimum, the layer of management above them. the layers of management above that are at minimum incentivising this kind of shortcut or even forcing it to happen due to not buying enough proper equipment.-- ie: giam siap exploitative nonsense.   this article was posted by a user below. it appears that the workers were jury rigging by using two emergency scissor jacks to lift a bus.  this is insane. a scissor jack typically has a weight rating of 1.5 tons. a single deck bus, when empty, will weight about 18 tons. even the byd c6 electric minibuses are about 7 tons. even in the best case scenario where you have a minibus, lifting a corner of a bus is likely to overload one of the two jacks due to unequal sharing of the weight. and we know that in the real world the jacks were overloaded because one of them bucked under the weight. this practice is unacceptably dangerous even if they were just using this clownshow set-up to lift the bus on to a set of properly rated jack stands. an over-loaded jack can fail and shoot metal into your body.  the question i want to ask is this: why dafuq are workers in a depot using a set of emergency automotive scissor jacks to do this? are there insufficient lifts and mechanics pits for the amount of productivity upper management is demanding from these workers? cranking a whole ass bus on 2 of these stupid under-powered manual scissor jacks is not going to be easy. this is both more work and less safe. which worker is going to want to do this kind of tiring dangerous nonsense unless people above were squeezing them to do it? you tell me.   they probably knew it was unsafe, but had to comply. i wonder if they were foreign workers who essentially have no choice if management demands irresponsible crazy shit like this of them  everytime we have accidents like this, our establishment like to shoot all blame at the lowest ranking, ideally dead, scapegoat. there will be some kafka-esque motherhood statements about \"always safely follow safety regulations\" and \" safety breaches are caused by not following safety rules\" and  that will be that. there is always great resistance to systemic and process driven change because achieving this requires that people think critically about systems and infrastructure rather than endlessly thinking critically about other people. in an authoritarian country the former is impossible while the latter is obligatory.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/workplace-deaths-smrt-workers-pinned-under-bus-wheel-loader-14978742"

which include how \"rest days\" are interpreted and whether an employee can work for 12 consecutive days over a 14-day period - will impact not only the plaintiffs but the whole of the employment sector in singapore.> the 13 suits amount to s$720,000, which is beyond the district court's limit, he said.> mr singh objected to having the case heard in the high court, claiming abuse of court process and saying there is no important question of law.> he said there is nothing to suggest that the issues raise difficult or complex issues. the state courts regularly deal with disputes involving the interpretation of employment agreements and the provisions of the employment act, he added.> he said mr chua has not shown credible evidence that damages in his suit would exceed s$250,000, the jurisdictional limit of the district court.> justice lim said an important question of law need not necessarily be a complex or difficult one, and that just because the state courts deal with employment disputes does not mean there may not be important questions of law in the provisions of the employment act.> she found that the questions of law in this case are important ones which affect a larger class of employees, pointing to how 12 other drivers filed similar suits.> \"the employment act provides for mandated rest days and limits to hours of work (among other matters) to protect the rights of employees,\" she said.> \"the question of whether this can be 'overridden' in a case where an employee is deemed to provide essential services, which on its face may not look like a difficult question, is important as it affects a larger population of workers in general,\" the judge said.> the case would have potential ramifications on how such contracts are structured in terms of granting days off, computing overtime pay and determining work hours, she added.> the case will be heard at a later date.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "one thing i like to talk about is how the transitioning works. its cool! the idea of this transition is that smrt will run their yishun services until 2am on 5 sep, and then three hours later, when another new day starts at 5am, 5 sep, the same buses will come out on service, but as tower transit buses. basically, a lot of things happen between 2am and 5am that day. note that this is based on how transitions worked over the past few years at bulim, loyang, and seletar and a friend who has also experienced a similar transition as a bus captain. buses: all buses are owned by lta, so transfer of ownership isn't an issue. tower transit already has a small fleet of buses allocated to them by lta when they moved in to the new depot earlier this year. these buses are sufficient for training, etc., but not enough to run the services, so smrt will have to transfer those buses to them. by this time, many of the yishun smrt buses you see already have \"smrt\" word removed from their internal stickers like \"thank you for travelling with smrt\" or \"welcome aboard smrt\". on the morning of 4 sep, some of the buses destined to transfer to tower transit will have the \"smrt\" brand removed from the buses. when the buses finish their duty on that day (can be as early as 7pm or as late as 2am depending on shift), they will be driven directly to tower transit's depot at mandai where technicians will inspect them and then paste tower transit stickers. the transfer of buses is complete. interchanges: as part of the bus package, tower will also be taking over the management of yishun and sembawang interchanges. note that yishun interchange is shared with sbs transit who has more services there, but the interchange will be managed by tower transit. the logistics of the transition may have already been planned long long time ago, all concerning that crucial 3-hour period between 2am and 5am. at 2am, after the last smrt buses finish their day, they will move out of the interchange office, taking away all their own equipment, furniture, etc. (some may be moved at a later date, but i'm not sure about that). then, tower transit will move in to the office and bring in their equipment. and then there's those smrt brands i.e. signboards, stickers, etc. those may or may not be changed that night, but at the very least, a tower transit sticker will be pasted over them. staff: as part of the transition, some of the smrt staff (especially drivers) will also go to tower transit. tower transit may have already recruited their own staff, but they are also required to take in smrt's staff that are affected by the change in operator. transfer of staff is much simpler in terms of logistics. staff destined to be transferred to tower transit would have been briefed on admin stuff months prior, and may have already collected their uniform and standard issue items beforehand. therefore, it is just a simple matter of reporting to work on 4 sep as smrt staff, and on the next day, you wear your new uniform and report to work as tower transit staff. according to what my friend said, when you are transferred to the new operator this way, your years of service with previous operator is still recognised. you get to keep your rank/job grade (converted to equivalent rank/grade in the company). your pay and benefits remain the same. your leave entitlements remain the same as before. so if smrt paid you a higher allowance than tower pays to their staff, you will still receive the same allowance as you have received before in smrt."

                "comment": "\"bukit batok\"main reason is buses want, or rather, need to keep to their schedule.now, the traffic lights in bukit batok, especially around the central area are horribly timed, causing inefficiencies and unnecessary traffic backlog. thus, particularly during peak hours, buses along bukit batok end up delayed as they require extra time in bukit batok.as for buses moving forward while waiting for green lights, more often than not is that buses are anticipating the lights to turn green so that they will be able to move as soon as the lights turn green. since the drivers frequently drive their routes, they would no doubt be familiar with the traffic lights conditions and roughly know when the lights turn green.regarding drivers who horn when the light just turns green, usually these drivers are already delayed and would appreciate the vehicle in front to move, so that they can catch up on their schedule. but indeed, they probably shouldn't horn just as the lights turn green as that could come across as impatient and that extra second probably wouldn't matter much, unless the vehicle in front takes their time."

which runs from bukit panjang to expo in the east - at a cost of $21 billion.> \"it is not a profitable line, so the government uses public funds to subsidise the running of the line, and operation subsidy comes up to over $60 million a year for the dtl stretch connecting bukit panjang to the city,\" he said.> at the same time, ridership on bus services that run parallel to the dtl has fallen significantly, he said.> for service 171, which will see its route changed, ridership fell by over 30 per cent from 2015 to 2019. for service 700, which will be removed, it was more than a 50 per cent drop in the same period.> he said services 171 and 700 are also being subsidised, costing taxpayers $14 million a year.> \"if the bus services are the only public transport option available to residents, lta is able to justify the public spending,\" he said. \"but with the dtl available, lta needs to exercise prudence in public spending, and is hence making the changes announced.\"> mr ong told the resident that he fully understood the concerns about service 972 - which has been amended to ply dunearn road - having more stops, and service 190 being more crowded after the change.> \"i have asked lta to look into this, and they should be prepared to inject more buses if necessary,\" he added. \"lta will engage the grassroots adviser, mr liang eng hwa, and hear out residents for mitigating measures.\"> he added: \"we seek the understanding of residents as we work through these changes, and strike a balance between the needs of various groups of commuters and financial prudence.\"> related story new sungei kadut mrt station linking north-south and downtown lines could shorten trips by 30 mins> the same $60 million subsidy figure for the dtl was cited by senior minister of state for transport chee hong tat in a facebook post on friday evening.> mr chee said he would be meeting mps liang eng hwa and edward chia on saturday with lta representatives to discuss the issue.> mr liang previously said he is aware of the ridership drop, but called for a \"compromise solution\" which does not call for the removal of services.> sbs transit, a subsidiary of transport giant comfortdelgro, beat rival smrt to land the dtl contract with a bid of about $1.6 billion over 19 years from 2013. annualised, the licence charge works out to be around $84.2 million a year.> asked why taxpayers were subsidising the running of a line which a private company had undertaken to operate in a competitive tender, the lta said the sum was necessary to make up for a shortfall in funds necessary for the eventual asset replacement of the line.> \"under the new rail financing framework (nrff), the operator pays the government a licence charge for the use of operating assets, such as trains and signalling system. this goes towards their eventual replacement and renewal,\" an lta spokesman said.> \"as the dtl is not a profitable line, the licence charge paid by sbst is insufficient to cover the annual depreciation, and hence the eventual replacement of the dtl operating assets.> \"the difference between the annual depreciation and licence charge paid is the government's subsidy for dtl operations. this comes up to about $60 million a year for the dtl stretch connecting bukit panjang to the city.\"> the dtl is the first line operated under the nrff, where the government owns all fixed and operating assets, and the operator focuses on maintenance and meeting service standards.> related story trains and buses to run at pre-circuit breaker frequencies from june 2 amid safe distancing challenges> related story covid-19 delays mrt network expansion timeline> related story work on hume mrt station on downtown line to start in the fourth quarter> unlike the bus contracting system, the government does not assume revenue risk in the nrff.> sbs transit had said that ridership had been lower than projected, but analysts were expecting the line to break even this year. this expectation however was made before the pandemic.> public transport ridership is at around half the volume it was before the covid-19 crisis.> commenting on the $60 million subsidy, singapore university of social sciences transport economist walter theseira called for more transparency on rail funding.> \"we know that on a systemwide basis, operating costs are now subsidised for rail but there is little information put out about the basis for these calculations, where subsidies are going, to whom, et cetera,\" he said.> dr theseira added that in the case of the dtl, \"we should be open\" about how the revenue shortfall came out.> \"we can accept that it is necessary to rescue a commercial operator which made a mistake in bidding - especially if factors that caused the financial distress are beyond an operator's control - but we don't know how exactly it came about and to what extent it is beyond operator control,\" said the former nominated mp.> \"we are not having a discussion about the right questions in public transport contracting and financing.\"---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "> # doctor suspended from practice after indecently exposing himself to woman on bus> singapore: a doctor who indecently exposed himself to a woman on a bus has been suspended from practice.> dr azman osman, a doctor with more than 23 years standing, faced a charge of professional misconduct brought by the singapore medical council (smc) after he was convicted in july 2017 of insulting the modesty of a woman.> advertisement> advertisement> in their grounds of decision made available on tuesday (jul 13), a disciplinary tribunal ruled that dr azman should be suspended for four months.> on jul 10, 2016 at about 1.15pm, the doctor was on board an sbs bus when he unzipped his trousers before a 56-year-old woman, and exposed his underwear and groin.> the disciplinary tribunal said dr azman claimed trial despite being offered a choice of a warning by a police officer.> \u201che maintained his belief that he was justified in his actions due to the provocation of the 56-year-old victim,\u201d the grounds said.> advertisement> advertisement> \u201caccording to (dr azman), he believed that the victim \u2026 was a prostitute and he felt provoked by her attire as she was wearing a pair of shorts so revealing that she had exposed her underwear to (him) while sitting and facing him on the sbs bus.> \u201ctherefore, in retaliation to the perceived provocation, he decided to expose his underwear to the victim.\u201d> he was convicted in court on jul 18, 2017 after a trial and was sentenced to two weeks\u2019 imprisonment.> about six months later, the smc informed dr azman that the matter was being referred to the disciplinary tribunal. he initially disagreed with the charge brought by the smc, but eventually expressed \u201csincere remorse\u201d for his actions after receiving legal advice. he also pleaded guilty to the charge.> advertisement> the tribunal referred the matter to a health committee to determine if dr azman was fit to practise as a doctor or if he might be impaired by a medical condition.> the tribunal said his reasoning for exposing himself to the woman was \u201cbizarre\u201d and that the doctor may \u201ccontinue with similar reasoning\u201d when attending to patients.> at a hearing in oct 2018, the tribunal noted that dr azman \u201cappeared detached\u201d from the proceedings and it appeared he had a \u201crather sensitive and labile personality that may be subject to mood swings\u201d.> an inquiry by the health committee found that the fitness of dr azman to practise was not impaired by reason of his mental condition. furthermore, the committee observed that he was able to explain his behaviour in a \u201crational and cogent manner\u201d.> \u201ceven though (dr azman) held very strong religious views which may have affected the way he reacted, these values would not impair his ability to practise as a medical practitioner or to deal with his patients in an appropriate manner,\u201d said the tribunal.> in asking for a six- to nine-month suspension, the smc said dr azman demonstrated no insight into the \u201cobjectionable nature of his conduct\u201d nor showed any remorse for his actions.> the act of exposing himself was intentional and an act of retaliation, the council added. it also asked that dr azman should only undertake consultations on female patients with a chaperone present, except in an emergency.> dr azman exposing his underwear and groin to the woman was a \u201cdeliberate and calculated move, not a momentary lapse of judgement\u201d, said the smc, adding that he had \u201cbrazenly refused\u201d to zip up his trousers despite being asked to by the victim and the bus driver.> during the trial, the doctor cast \u201cbaseless aspersions\u201d on the victim and tried to portray himself as the victim, claiming he was provoked by the victim\u2019s attire, the tribunal heard.> the council said dr azman \u201cremained recalcitrant\u201d even after serving two weeks\u2019 imprisonment as he had initially maintained that his actions were justified.> in defence, dr azman\u2019s lawyer said the doctor had committed a \u201cone-off offence\u201d and that it was not a premeditated act.> he highlighted dr azman\u2019s \u201clong unblemished\u201d track record and said he had pleaded guilty once he had legal advice.> the tribunal said the manner in which he contested his criminal charge was \u201cincompatible with the standards of moral integrity expected from members of the medical profession\u201d.> \u201cthe harm to the victim was \u2018slight\u2019 since there was no physical contact with the victim and no evidence of permanent harm caused even though the act had caused some emotional distress to the victim,\u201d the tribunal said in its ruling.> taking into account dr azman\u2019s state of mind during the offence, the tribunal called it a \u201ccalculated and deliberate act\u201d.> \u201cthere was no medical evidence before the dt to suggest that (dr azman) was suffering from any mental condition which would reduce his culpability. he knew what he was doing and he fully intended his action to upset the victim as an act of retaliation,\u201d the tribunal said, adding that he was not \u201ctruly remorseful\u201d.> besides the suspension, dr azman will be censured and must give a written undertaking to the smc that he will not engage in similar conduct in the future. he will also pay the costs and expenses of and incidental to the proceedings.---1.0.2 | [source

amounting to 4.4 per cent - will be implemented at the next fre in 2021, said the public transport council (ptc) at a virtual media briefing on friday (4 september). concession fares and schemes will also remain unchanged.> sbs transit and smrt trains had applied for the 4.4 per cent quantum in the second half of august. sbs transit cited losses in its rail operations and significant cost pressures in areas such as manpower and repairs and maintenance. operating cost has also further increased due to safety measures to deal with the pandemic. in its latest financial year, sbs transit\u2019s train segment reported a loss in tens of millions of dollars.> meanwhile, smrt cited escalating costs to operate an expanding train network with increasing operations and maintenance demands. smrt trains also incurred additional costs to ensure a safe transit environment for commuters, in light of the pandemic. for its latest financial year ended march 2020, smrt trains recorded a net loss of around $20 million after tax.> citing the \u201cexceptional economic circumstances\u201d brought on by the pandemic, ptc chair richard magnus said the decision not to raise fares is aimed at helping to ease the financial burden on commuters. \u201cour priority will be to safeguard commuters\u2019 interests, while ensuring a financially sustainable public transport system that continues to meet the needs of singaporeans in the years to come.\u201d> ptc said that it will continue to monitor the macroeconomic indices and prevailing economic conditions closely. in making its decision for the fre in 2021, the council will also continue to balance fare affordability and financial sustainability.> the move is a sharp contrast to the 2019 fre, when the ptc approved one of the largest public transport fare increases in recent years, with card fares for adults travelling on buses and trains increasing by up to nine cents.> asked by yahoo news singapore if the ptc had considered fare reductions or increasing concessionary schemes, magnus acknowledged that the former had been considered but eventually decided against, due to a number of factors.> the ptc chair noted that there is already a \u201cwide gap\u201d between fare revenue and operating costs, with the former insufficient in meeting the cost of the latter.> assistance is also being extended to low-income families to mitigate transport costs, with the application deadline for the 2019 public transport voucher (ptv) exercise extended from 31 october 2020 to 31 january 2021, to give eligible households more time to apply for the vouchers. around 30,000 low-income households will also progressively receive ptvs directly.> magnus also cited \u201cwider-based support\u201d that is already being given by the government through various budget measures, such as the $600 payout given to every singaporean in march.> ptc noted that the \u201csharp and sustained drop\u201d in ridership due to the pandemic significantly affects the network capacity factor (ncf) component in the fare adjustment formula. alongside the ncf, the formula is based on the core consumer price index, wage index, energy index and a productivity extraction factor of 0.1 per cent.> the ncf, which was introduced in 2018, is not designed to address sharp fluctuations in ridership caused by exceptional circumstances, said magnus.> ptc will therefore conduct a mid-term review on how ncf ought to be applied, or whether it should be partially or totally excluded, when considering its effect on next year\u2019s fare adjustment. the review will be completed before the next fre in 2021.> in addition, the rail network has been expanding steadily, alongside the rapid advance in productivity-enhancing technology. at the same time, the government is providing significant operational subsidies to sustain the public transport network.> \u201cthis mid-term review is therefore timely to ensure that fare adjustment formula remains relevant and responsive,\u201d said ptc.> ptc noted that the pandemic has significantly affected public transport operators, with whole-day ridership falling by around 75 per cent during the partial lockdown from april to june. nevertheless, trains and buses have continued to run largely at pre-pandemic frequencies.> ridership has been slowly creeping up since - average weekday ridership is now at 60 per cent of pre-covid levels. bus and train frequencies are expected to remain at current levels. public transport operators have also stepped up cleaning regimes, which come at a significant cost amidst the sharp drop in fare revenue.> prior to covid-19, authorities were expected to spend close to $1 billion to renew and upgrade rail operating assets, and another $1 billion to subsidise public bus services annually over the next five years. this translates to more than $1 in subsidies for every journey taken.> \u201cwith the impact of covid-19, revenues have fallen further, and we expect government subsidies to be even higher this year,\u201d said the ptc.> when asked if the government would be absorbing the 4.4 per cent quantum increase, magnus said, \u201cwill the operators be able to run the operations at their costs? i think there's already discussion between the government and the public transport operators with regard to this particular area...the principle really is that there should be optimisation of the public transport system, bearing in mind the demand and the supply and the situation, at that point of time.\u201d> stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t.me/yahoosingapore> related stories:> essential business, official travel between singapore and south korea now allowed> adult card fares to increase by up to 9 cents: public transport council> bus, train card fares for adults to increase by 6 cents: public transport council---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "indeed -- i agree. the article didn't mention the definition of \"wear\", which, according to [regulation 2(1)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/sl/covid19tma2020-s254-2020?docdate=20200703&timeline=on#pr2-), means> to wear a mask over and covering the wearer's nose and mouth, with the mask touching the wearer's nose and cheeksso it appears that the man is, for the purposes of the law, \"wear[ing]\" a \"mask\".by contrast, a person with a mask on his/her chin, or on his/her mouth but not nose, wouldn't be \"wear[ing]\" a mask.note also that the definition of \"mask\" doesn't say that \"mask\" *means* a \"paper or textile covering designed or made to be worn over the nose and mouth to provide the wearer protection against infections or air pollution\". rather, the definition says that \"mask\" *includes* (but is not limited to) those things. so there's no reason in principle why even a t-shirt can't count as a \"mask\" for the purposes of the law, notwithstanding that a t-shirt isn't designed to prevent infections/air pollution.edit: some may ask whether a neck gaiter is effective in preventing the spread of disease. whether it is is besides the point: what, for present purposes, counts is what the law says. i also wonder how, if at all, it could be possible to phrase a definition of \"mask\" that includes purpose-made surgical masks and cloth masks but excludes neck gaiters, particularly given that a neck gaiter *is* designed (even if unsuccessfully) to prevent infection."

                "comment": "> # 10 electric double-decker buses join public bus fleet> singapore: singapore moved a step closer to a cleaner public bus fleet with the introduction of 10 electric double-decker buses on tuesday (oct 27).> this batch is part of the 60 electric buses the land transport authority (lta) purchased in 2018 for s$50 million from three outfits - the chinese yutong-nari consortium, shenzhen-based byd, as well as singapore firm st engineering.> advertisement> advertisement> the 10 new yutong double-deckers - each of which is able to carry about 120 passengers - bring the total number of electric buses here to 25, out of a public bus fleet of about 5,800.> the lta rolled out an initial batch of 10 yutong single-deck electric buses in april, across five routes operated by the four public bus operators here. another five byd single-deck buses were introduced in july.> all 60 electric buses are expected to be deployed by next year.> they will join 50 diesel-electric hybrid buses already on the roads, which were purchased from volvo at a cost of s$30 million in 2017.> advertisement> advertisement> the authority had noted the use of electric buses would help reduce carbon emissions by about 7,840 tonnes per year - the equivalent to the emissions from 1,700 cars.> such buses will also be quieter, with electric buses generating an ambient noise level of around 75 decibels - three decibels lower than that of a typical euro 6 diesel bus.> the lta had first tested the use of an electric bus here with shenzhen-based byd and bus operator go-ahead between 2016 and 2017, as part of a trial on the suitability of such vehicles here.> advertisement> the electric double-deckers will begin rolling out on three services from tuesday.> they include service 83 - which is operated by go-ahead and plies a 13km route around punggol and sengkang - and service 189, which is run by tower transit and serves a 16km route in the bukit batok area.> the new buses will also be available on service 983, an smrt service plying an 11km route in the choa chu kang area.> it will take about four hours to fully charge each of the double-decker buses, which can travel up to 215km on a single charge.> the lithium iron phosphate batteries used by the buses are able to withstand high operating temperatures, enhancing commuter safety, said the lta.> in march, then-senior minister of state for transport janil puthucheary said the government would buy only electric or hybrid buses moving forward, in line with its goal to have public buses run on cleaner energy by 2040.> located at the back of the buses first deck, the batteries allow the buses to travel for up to 415km when fully-charged. (photo: zhaki abdullah)> worth the price> transport minister ong ye kung and senior minister of state for transport chee hong tat viewed some of the new buses on tuesday during a visit to the bulim depot, managed by tower transit.> speaking to the media after the visit, mr chee noted electric buses were pricier compared to conventional diesel-powered models.> in response to media queries, the lta said electric buses could be up to twice the price of a diesel bus, and up to 35 per cent more than a diesel-electric hybrid bus.> the management of the current electric fleet will help it better understand the life cycle cost of such buses, it added.> \"we are doing it (purchasing cleaner fuel buses) because we believe that it's better for the environment and this is a step that we want to take to support a more sustainable, greener future,\" said mr chee, who is also senior minister of state for foreign affairs.> \"i believe as technology evolves, the costs of the batteries, the electric buses, cleaner fuel for buses will come down and we also have more options that we can choose from,\" he added, noting this could possibly include hydrogen or fuel cell powered models.> charging infrastructure> the lta said two types of charging infrastructure will be used for these 60 electric buses, with 40 buses using plug-in charging.> \u201cfor plug-in charging, buses are charged by manually plugging in charger guns overnight during off-revenue hours at the bus depots. they are charged at between 90kw to 150kw for two to four hours,\u201d said an lta spokesperson.> the larger batteries on board these buses allow them to run for between 200km and 300km on a full charge, the spokesperson added.> there are currently 32 charging stations spread across the bulim, loyang and seletar bus depots.> electric bus charging points at the bulim bus depot. (photo: zhaki abdullah)> meanwhile, another 20 buses will use pantograph charging, where chargers mounted overhead at designated parking lots lower connectors on to the roof of buses to allow them to charge.> \u201cwith pantograph charging, electric buses are charged at a higher power input of up to 450kw during their short lay-over time of 10 to 15 minutes at bus interchanges,\u201d the lta said, adding that these buses have smaller batteries onboard as well as a shorter operating mileage of up to 48km per charge.> pantograph charging is expected to be used by the 20 electric buses supplied by st engineering.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"
