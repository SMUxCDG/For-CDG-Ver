                "comment": "So what's the question ?\nIf you're planning to calculate losses, and want to be very specified, you need to include the following :\n- buyer stamp duty\n- principal interest (just find any calculators and calculate)\n- renovation costs\n- town council/property tax per month\n- agent fee for selling \n\nThe market now is not like last time already, last time non-matured estates are undersubscribed so it's easy to get a decent unit, and were way cheaper, now everywhere except tengah is oversubscribed, so you'll be lucky to even get a decent queue number. BTO is good if you're able to grab the grants as well, otherwise if you factor in the above, you won't be making much profit when you sell in the future.\n\nIs BTO a long term investment? I feel no, but given the options available, BTO is still the best in the market, I feel if you want to buy a property now, buy for the need, not the greed, whatever profit you make from your current one, you'll have to put into renovation for the new house as well.\n\nWhen you calculate remember to keep 20k in CPF OA to enjoy the 3.5% interest"

This is because even in the resales, they will be generally benchmark to the BTO pricing within the area.\n\n1) When a non-mature estates transitions to a mature estate. For most, it will be a significant rise in value and since the physical value is low, the % returns are generally higher.\n\n2) When you hit the lottery and get a BTO in a hot estate (i.e Duxton or the upcoming Southern Waterfront Area)"
