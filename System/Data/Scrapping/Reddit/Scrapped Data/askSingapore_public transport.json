Grab/Gojek/taxi always came out as cheaper, even if I factored in a perpetual surge pricing. What kills you is the additional: Parking, insurance, maintenance, etc. For no loss in convenience other than the wait while you try to get a car, it saves a ton.\n\nBeing married with kids and having drastically improved financial standing now, I\u2019m considering learning driving and buying a car now. Why, you might ask? Because having a car is more than a means of transport: It is a portable storage. The boot space. The car seats. The ability to fetch friends and family. I feel like this is something PHVs cannot give, so it\u2019s steering me towards getting a license and a car.\n\nThat said, I have had times before when I travelled abroad and regretted not having a license to rent a car. Driving overseas almost feels like a need, given how far things are and how pampered we\u2019ve been by Singapore\u2019s public transport system. Maybe get the license first. Car can talk later."

Treat it like \"how to ride a bike\" skill. Once you get it, you never forget it.\n\nI found it super useful when I went to Bay Area for biz trip. Public transport is basically nonexistent. And Uber costs a lot. Luckily my company partnered with a car dealer, so renting car was free. Hence, I just rented the car and made weekend trips to SF (from Sunnyvale) and went to lots of places for free (which could easily cost me 500$+ with Uber).\n\nYou also never know where you are going to retire. And learning it when you are older might be more challenging as you get more risk averse."

Not to mention the chore of booking lessons/ test dates etc. And the money I \u201csaved\u201d by paying for these way back then, rather than the increased fees now. \n\nSo if you\u2019re even thinking about it and can afford the money/ time, I\u2019d say go for it. Your future self will probably thank you. \n\nAs many others have mentioned, it\u2019s not really a necessity in Singapore (barring some job/ family circumstances), but it\u2019s a great life skill, and will be very helpful in most other countries (including our neighbouring ones).\n\nI also like to plan for highly unlikely emergencies - to be able to hop in a car and make a quick escape is probably essential in a zombie apocalypse :)."

Taking a cab/private hire every day will still be cheaper than owning a car in Singapore imo, plus you get to chill as a passenger instead of worrying or road raging. \n\nAgree with some others here that it makes a difference overseas though. Getting around in many parts of US or Australia for example would be almost impossible without a car. So if you ever plan a trip to these places please go with people who can drive, but of course do contribute by navigating/keeping the drivers entertained on road trips!  \n\nAlso I personally just don\u2019t enjoy driving. I can get quite anxious and panicky so driving just makes me more stressed than anything else. I\u2019ve met many people who genuinely enjoy it though, and I think it makes so much more sense for such people to be on the road instead."

It helps that we're very small and our MRT network is getting more connected.\n\nDon't get a license because everyone around you is getting one. Our public transport network is fantastic, and in the time it takes for us to feel FOMO about getting a license and the time most of us can actually afford a car, we probably would have forgotten how to drive.\n\n(P.S Not that you asked, but even getting the cheapest motorcycle works out to be a few times more expensive than taking public transport in the long-run, but the catch is that you are at least cutting down your commute time by at least 50% on average so it's an *okay* trade.)"

It was great for after midnight supper sessions. \n\nA motorbike is a lot more affordable but my parents would get into a heated argument with me whenever I suggested buying one.\n\nRental is $2 per hour after midnight from Mon - Thur, although you need to pump the petrol should it drop below 25%. \n\nI would encourage you to at least have a driving license, as you would not know if you would be given a vehicle to drive in future. The lesson fees are also getting increasingly expensive, so it's better to do it now than later."

Even if you are not driving to work, it is still very expensive. But a car is super useful when you hang out with colleagues and friends. And you know, it can be quite happening when you are young. During my young days, it wasn't as cheap and convenient to grab a taxi.\n\nCar will definitely enrich your life a little but comes at a greater cost. Now I'm married with two kids and there are always discussions with friends between owning a car and not. To me, I feel having a car improves your quality of life if you can afford and willing to throw into car ownership.\n\nImagine this, house mortgage loan, money for your parents, household expense, kids expenses, kids insurance premium, your own insurance, personal phone, broadband and u need even to finance a car loan, road tax, fuel, car insurance, maintenance. Maybe medical expenses as well.\n\nSo if you chose not to own a car when you are young and free, you probably won't start doing it after you move into your own house with kids.\n\nI started to own a car when young and I still own a car now with two kids. If I have financial difficulties in the future, the first thing to go will be the car. My current car is about 3.5 years old and have recently paid off its loan.\n\nWith the current Coe prices, the annual costs to own a car is about 18-19k (10k depreciation + the rest for fuel, insurance, road tax and maintenance).\n\nSo you might wanna think about it. Hope this helps! YOLO!"

Allow me to explain if you will;\n\n They have to constantly communicate with air traffic control, be on a look out for weather, monitor vital systems of the aircraft and performance of the aircraft, be prepared and plan for emergency should it occur and also the amount of planning beforehand is crazy, the amount of stress in having to deal with so many factors, fuel (dependant on weather also), weight, weather planning (to avoid unfavorable weather areas), late passengers, the stress of the company breathing down your neck wanting you to depart on time to avoid extra delay fees etc, these are the stuff pax don't usually get to see haha\n\nAutopilot is not there to completely eliminate the workload.

                "comment": "honestly as some one driving daily, SG is pretty damn nice for public transport. road trips are not very fun \n\nanyway here's a list:\n\n1) ECP crossing Marina Bay - scenic with F1 pit and Marina Bay buildings\n\n2) Tanah Merah Coast Rod - long stretch of empty road when you go at night. Very peaceful (don't speed, cameras everywhere) watching the streetlight go past.\n\n3) Yishun Dam - can stop road side and look at the sea. If you go on weekend midnight, there will be stretch of cars, ppl like to fish there. Just be careful of LTA cos it's technically double yellow line \n\n4) Random roads in Holland, Bukit Timah, and Bedok South area - i like rooming at 8 figure houses and there are lots of them there\n\n5) Mount faber during early morning\n\nif you're bored you can what i do, i drive to parks like kent ridge/ mount faber at night and just sit there and stone"

You can dabao the beer on tap also, bring some glass bottles. They also will sell you plastic bottles for that purpose, but I find it loses effervescence fast that way.\n\nThe changi village hawker centre has alot of good food too. There's also a shop (Makan Melaka) selling chendol just opposite the Nasi lemak stalls. The guy hand makes the green wormy things in the morning, so it's legit.\n\nChangi Chapel and Musuem is worth checking out if you want to learn more about ww2 history during the Japanese occupation.

It's good to know early whether your financial/spending lifestyles match."

But I need to say that perhaps from a young lady's perspective, ~~they all have their~~ she has her dreams of marrying *that guy* who is rich, handsome and drives a shiny sports car like how a lot of young men do these days (whether they are self made or not).\n\nI met my gf via OKC 6 years ago. She was so young back then, fresh grad. She had her princess dream too.\n\nGuess what? I had almost nothing. I was earning so little for my first job as a Graphic Designer I felt sad not being even able to buy her a good meal. Her mum low key looked down on me and persuaded her many times to leave me.\n\nFast forward till today, we're happily together for almost 6 years and have been planning for BTO and our marriage if not for COVID.\n\nWe both grew and changed a lot over the years. She got more pragmatic and understood the difficulties of earning a paycheck when she got her first job. I've done pretty well since then and now we happily enjoy what we missed last time.\n\nIt's not about how they think now, and what their expectations are. Maybe it's how they will grow and change as they mature.\n\nHope you find your match soon.\n\n[Edit] As pointed out by a fellow Redditor, I've rephrases the second sentence to remove any semblance of stereotyping towards the lovely ladies out there. *Cheers!*"

In fact i also came from a low income family, with my dad being a taxi driver and my mom self employed.\n I've seen seeing a few comments about how young girls have \"princess dreams\" of wanting to be tgt with a rich guy who drives, bring them out to restaurants and buy luxuries. Would like to say not all girls are like that, some would even feel insecure due to not earning as much or other reasons. \n\n\nPersonal experience was when i had to choose between a guy who is able to spend over $250 on a single date (he's a regular in the army, earning around 4k/month) vs a guy whom our first date was to go running and have LJS for dinner (nsf with less than 1k/month), and i picked the latter. Being well off didnt mean anything to me, even though i was struggling to get by day by day with my banquet pay (around ~700/month). And it's how he treats me and how he taught me about managing my finances (because he came from a low income family too), and i honestly feel that if i chose the former, i would not be learning these stuff that helps me grow as a person. \n\n\nTake your time to find your other half because such things cant be rushed and they may come from places unexpected. Seeing how the girls you met are always \"high ses\", you may need to lower your expectations then you'll find the right one for you."

That is the reality, and most women are not comfortable dating guys who are less well off than them. Most guys are not comfortable dating women who are better off than them.\n\nIt's not that you can't or won't find matches and dates, it's that one or both of you may feel uncomfortable about it, and that already is the seed of incompatibility.\n\nThat said, have confidence. I used to date girls who were much, much better off than I was. At the time I was taking the bus and renting a room while dating young women living in landed properties and daughters of rich tycoons.\n\nI was a very, very confident young ( introverted) man.\n\nIt's perfectly doable if you can stomach them paying for things. Some of them don't mind the large income gap, and the ones that do mind only really do so initially. Your personality match is usually enough if they like you.\n\nRight now my wife is the main breadwinner. She pulls in about 70% of the combine monthly household earnings. She initially had a lot of issues with it, but we've been together 17 years already. So clearly it is quite doable.\n\nAt one point, I told her she is free to go find another better earning man, because that isn't  my priority. If that's what she wants, I'm not that guy. \n\nLike I said, I was/am a very, very confident guy.\n\nI would say to not let self-doubt hold you back from giving 100% of yourself to your dates, but also understand that it is perfectly normal if women don't want to continue if you make less than they do. Don't beat yourself up over it. Use it as a means to improve your situation and move up.\n\nThe most important thing to women is that their men are doing something, striving, and ambitious. Most women are willing to go through that process of growth with you. It is the striving and the mindset of striving that is important, not the actual success. \n\nThis is one of the reason women will put up with guys who are gung ho and (over) confident.\n\nLearn not to care that you make less, but strive to do something with yourself and your life. You will find women will accept that more than your absolute dollar amount."

If that is not the demographic you're interested in dating, try a different platform.\n\nAnyway, I know it sounds quite 'no shit', but there's no point in being insecure about your background. It's not going to change, and the insecurity itself might well be a bigger turn-off.  If people are agreeing to go on dates with you, it means there's something they liked in your profile. Don't think about it as you not being good enough for them, think about it in terms of compatibility. Your background doesn't make you inferior."

You mention that it\u2019s anecdotal, fine, but your title is very off putting. \n\nThe stereotype that women only want rich future partner is very, very wrong. It may be true for some, but definitely not for all. Wanting financial security and stability is one thing but using a car as a measure of wealth is way off. Especially today and for people of our generation when owning a car doesn\u2019t make sense financially. Anyway, women can make their own damn money! We don\u2019t have to rely on men for financial support.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re just swiping on all the women that only care about materialistic things... Maybe evaluate that first instead of stereotyping all Singaporean women."

If you\u2019re including older ladies in the mix - ladies in their late 20s and early 30s would have more disposable income and be used to nicer meals (like $20-30 for a meal and drink on a night out).\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a bit outclassed, there\u2019s something super sexy about a guy who can cook so you could work on a couple of dishes until you can make them well. It\u2019s much cheaper to have a steak or pasta dinner at home. And guys are lucky, you literally need one nice pair of shoes and suit and shirt that fits. \n\nI dated guys who were different education levels when I was younger. They also decided to self sabo and not talk to me anymore (interest level dropped to 0 once they asked about my education / work) (or maybe they decided I wasn\u2019t fun or cute, idk, there was no feedback form). \n\nIf a girl really likes you, she will work with you for a brighter future. That being said you guys have to be compatible. There are lots of girls out there who wear flip flops and shorts / cheap clothes but if you\u2019re going for beautifully dressed girls in brand name labels instead then you should be well dressed too. \n\nPeople also tend to put in some effort to look better the first time they meet, too."

As I said above, the message I want to bring across is for guys (and girls alike) to think from the others' perspective to understand if there could be underlying reasons why a certain observed behaviour seems to be a trend (inferred from OP's experience)?\n\nNot all posts that mention a broad perspective arr about stereotyping ladies. That's a rather shallow and one-dimensional judgement of a simple piece of advice. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nUltimately, I agree with you that there girls out there who don't think this way (as quoted by your comment). The fact that you don't, I salute you.\n\nPerhaps you and OP could have a chat \ud83d\ude01"

It also made me a bit nervous when 1 of my boys was dating someone who stays in a big landed property (still, that girl is a v sweet one n my boy doesn't deserve her at that point as he was too immatured......).

We don\u2019t count as \u2018students\u2019 and instead we pay adult fares for normal trips, though there exists a university concession card which gives you unlimited rides on bus, mrt or both at a cost of between 55-90.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re overstating the need for Mandarin lmao. Besides, cai fan isn\u2019t the only cheap food option if you search around. You should also allow for a bigger food budget (~500) since $5 meals don\u2019t exist everywhere.  \n\nRent budget is fine I think (maybe push it to 800 to be safe). I\u2019d suggest you stay in Paya Lebar/Dakota since they\u2019re on the Circle Line, same as Bras Basah (since from your posts you\u2019ll be going to SMU?). They\u2019re old but decent neighbourhoods with cheap food and the National Stadium/East Coast Park is not too far away if you want to just have a chill walk outside.\n\nPhone budget is ok. Might wanna increase your \u2018others\u2019 budget just in case? No need if you\u2019re confident about your spending.\n\nSo yeah the final budget comes up to 500+800+90+20+90=1500. Obviously you can go even lower than your own budget or higher than mine, but I think mine accounts for more unplanned stuff + better quality of life (necessary to counteract uni stress) so you could consider it."

                "comment": "Based on where you might be going to school, I think a good idea of where to rent is looking along the blue line (bencoolen), which is right underneath SMU. \n\nFrom tampines/bedok reservoir stn to school is literally only going to take you less than 30mins to school, which is rather fast by all accounts. \n\nStaying near the mrt is also a good way to save money for transport. Uni student has concession for mrt only, which is around $55. Assuming each trip costs $2, back and forth is $4, you just need to 'go out/school' for around 16 days to breakeven. So even on the weekends, if you go out, just take the mrt to your closest destination and walk wherever you need to go. This works out quite well for me and save a lot of momey (+ exercise too)\n\nIt can also be good since youre an international student to be exploring Sg easily on the mrt. \n\nSeeing that you are a woman, do avoid staying near places around Geylang area if you can. Not that it is super unsafe, but generally at night it could get a bit shady. This extends to as far as Eunos area. This comment could be a bit controversial but just my opinion. \n\nIn terms of food option, $5 per meal is decent for day to day - try to buy from hawker and food court to save money. U can save on breakfast money by buying a large loaf of gardenia bread and make it fancy by buying sliced ham. This can make breakfast cost to around $1 per day or so. \n\nOne thing to note is going out/entertainment on the weekend. This can easily get very expensive. A meal in a cheap restaurant will cost easily $15 upwards. And a movie on the weekend is around $10 iirc. So do factor those in as well."

                "comment": "With regards to your mobile cost, it really depends on how you plan your usage. If you are going to use WiFi most of the time at home or in school, then you can actually cut that $20 down even further by going for the $10 for 6Gb plan. They have rollover data for 2 cycles so if you are not a heavy user, you can have double the data in the next month.\n\nIf you find that its too low, then try to wait for Giga's pop-up promos which happens usually during special events or holidays, then upgrade to get the $18 for 50Gb plan. \n\nHowever, that also depends on where you are staying cos Giga is under Starhub and their coverage is rather spotty in some areas like where I stay.. I get like only 1 bar in my house and 2 bars if I move close to the window. Their internet speeds are pretty good though.\n\nThe other alternative is TPG Mobile that offers $10 for 50Gb but I've no experience with them and I do have some concerns about their mobile coverage in Singapore. They have their own network. \n\nIn any case, these SIM-only plans have no contract, so you are free to switch after a month or so.. do read the fine prints in case there is a clause for early termination.\n\nFinally, DO NOT buy pre-paid cards... they are a complete rip-off IMO.\n\nOn transport, its really not too expensive to move around here. If you stay in the heartlands, the rent will probably be cheaper too.\n\nHope the above helps!"

Furthermore, SG's pretty small and commuting wouldn't be that long.\n\nFood: I think $5 per meal is pretty okay for hawker food but that means no drinks, nice dinner or meals in the city. You'll have to live on a strict diet. As for pricing, most hawkers have a large menu on their signboard or pasted on their stall. If you were to stay in the hearlands, it can be about $3-4 per meal at hawker centres.\n\nPublic transportation: there are no discount fees for anyone after high school so you should assume paying for adult fares. Fares are about $2 per trip (or slightly less). To and fro school would be $4 and for 31 days in a month, it would be $124. You can save by taking the MRT before 7:45 am where there is a $0.50 discount. \n\nPhone: $20 is possible. You can try Gomo which uses the infrastructure of the largest telco operator (Singtel). Have been using it for some time and so far there was no issue with receptions or any other issues. I've not manage to hit the 20GB (they sometimes give bonus data) mainly bcos work/study from home and availability of wifi everywhere around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can drop me a message if need be!"

By any chance are you enrolling in SMU?\n\nPublic transportation: Uni concession card still charges at the adult fare. What I do is to tap using a debit/credit card. This would save the hassle of topping up the prepaid card + save some admin costs from applying. Some cards do have cashback for public transports so you can look that up!\n\nPhone: You can try the personal finance site 'Seedly' to look at reviews on the various plans! Sometimes there are some promotions for various merchants. There are some telegram chatgroups which you can consider joining for the occasional discount codes/promotions (usually for food).\n\nEdit: saw the above comment on $55 for MRT only. You can take that up if it's available and makes financial sense to you. But that wasn't available for me I think, there was only the hybrid (bus+mrt) which costs >$100."

I really don't recommend SMEs if you're looking for the same level of treatment/benefits. It's so bad that I've quit the creative industry to give private tuition instead. At least the hours are much more flexible and I don't have to deal with selfish bosses.\n\n1. Overtime is normal, expected and unpaid. \n\n2. Supportive and understanding managers/HR that are empathic to your personal situations? Where? I've worked for 3 bosses so far, and only 1 comes kinda close to that and he's American. I still won't say he's 100% supportive and understanding though - it highly depended on his mood. The other bosses that are far from supportive and understanding are locals.\n\n3. Autonomy for the work that you do and the ability to learn and move across departments - none at all. All 3 bosses I've worked for are micromanagers (varying degrees). So much that I've given up on working for small companies.\n\n4. I've only had health/dental insurances from 1 startup (the American boss). The rest, nothing at all. Only CPF contribution but that's because it's the law.\n\nOther people I know who worked in MNCs get tons of benefits including 13th month, etc. I'm currently in the process of applying for big companies/MNCs overseas, so far I see they're promising much better benefits like insurance, transport than the stingy small companies I've worked for. \n\nTLDR: Don't work for SMEs/startups here if you want the same. Go for MNCs straight away. If the MNC don't promise you the benefits you want on black and white, stay where you are because it really sounds like heaven to me."

                "comment": "I had a very negative experience with ang moh MNCs, so do consider others' experiences and opinions as well. There are many MNCs out there and majority are quite enjoyable to work in, but unfortunately, the one I joined had left much to be desired. \n\nI used to work in an American MNC (Fortune 500 company) for 2 years. This was what I experienced: \n\n- Long working hours: officially they say you can come in any time as long as you're there during the core business hours of 10am - 4pm and you work 8 hours + 1 hour mealbreak. Reality is I often had to come in as early as 6.30am - 7am and leave as late as 11pm - 12am due to the work. Too much work and too few people. \n\n- I once thought, since they said as long as you're here within the core business hours of 10am - 4pm, so I can come at 10am right? No. The AD said we must start at 8.30am. \n\n- There's a lot of conference calls, webinars, town halls with European/American colleagues, but 100% its us following their timezone, not them accommodating our time zone. That meant staying up till 1am or waking up at 3am for calls. And for certain positions, there's no time off after that. You finish your call at 5am and then go straight to office. \n\n- Benefits: Some of the benefits/perks are indeed way better than those offered by many of the local companies, but its still quite far cry from those offered at Europe/US. \n\n- Annual Leave: We had a strict quota on annual leaves. The company gave you like 21 days of leaves (AL + special leave types), but rest assured its very hard to take leave when you needed to. You had to reserve a slot a year in advance, and leave freezes could come in anytime due to \"business needs\". \n\n- Vacation: The company was good enough to have special vacation i.e. shut-down for many of their offices during festive periods. For example, the US office is closed for a week or more during Thanksgiving and Christmas, while the China office is closed during CNY. Not for us here. There's no shut-down. And the worse? those people at offices that shut-down won't respond to any emails, and its very frustrating when you needed to get approval or get things done. \n\n- Office culture: Unfortunately, mine had a toxic culture with lots of backstabs. People there like to claim credit but when something goes wrong, they all disappear. \n\nI was considered a renegade in the office in a sense that most of my coworkers always look up to the ang mohs, and that whatever the ang mohs said are correct. I don't work that way. If someone said something that wasn't right, I would question back, ang moh or non-ang moh. That unfortunately was not well-received in the office. \n\nThe last straw for me was at the end of my 2nd year. I put in a lot of effort, pushed very hard, and was in the top 40% band. \nMy reward? $500 bonus, $30 increment. \nThere was also no AWS (13th month). \n\nI threw letter and left afterwards. Many others followed too, and it was certainly bad for some of the bosses as the company had high attrition rates and one of their KPIs for that year was staff retention. \n\nI went to a local MNC afterwards, and though the culture is very much different and quite rigid by many's standards, at least my job role gave me the work-life balance I was looking for. Plus, I get a 13th month and a fat 2-month bonus cheque even though I'm not in the top 50% tier. \n\n--- \n\nBad things aside, there were indeed good things my ex-MNC provided, such as free medical benefits - you get a card that allows you to visit panel clinics for free, and the company insurance guarantees you for hospital stays. \n\nOh, and the pantry is good too! The office occupies a few floors and on one of the floors, half of the space is used as the pantry where they have a billiard table, free flow soft drinks and biscuits, and weekly supply of fresh fruits. There also used to be a Wii console but you have to bring your own games. Unfortunately, I did not use that pantry much as we were so busy, and it'll attract unwanted attention and bad consequences for me if I were to even play that Wii during my lunch break. Things like \"Wow, you even have time to play Wii?\". Its mostly the ang mohs who utilise them. \n\nThat being said, I have many friends around me that worked in MNCs that have better work-life balance and a better office culture. \n\nOne of my friends worked in a Fortune 500 company that has a flexible work arrangement where you can work from home for a few days and come into office for a few days. \n\nThere's also another of my friend whose MNC gave generous allowances, bonuses, and many benefits. Some even have arrangements where they fly you to their other offices around the world to exchange or gain valuable experiences. \n\nAs for the company that I left, I think they got to their senses afterwards, and when another wave of attrition hits, they managed to retain a few with very generous retention bonus. There was a guy who was a high performer but was disillusioned, and when he threw letter, they promoted him, gave him a $5000 retention bonus, and a very high increment. But of course, that caused quite some unhappiness and made a few others leave. That guy eventually left too, but was lured back afterwards with an even better remuneration package. Well, that's good for him I'd say."

SME, MNC, French, American, British. \n\nI\u2019ve knocked off at 6pm sharp before. Or worked 27-hour days (this is not a typo). \n\nI have no bonus, bonus calculated in days not months, and I\u2019ve had 6-month bonuses. \n\nIt would be sweeping to imagine work culture translating from one country to the next. \n\nThere are stingy MNCs, and generous MNCs. Where benefits are concerned, they\u2019re determined by the local leadership and their tie-ups with panel healthcare or insurance providers. \n\nThe only thing within your control: research. Glassdoor, Fishbowl \u2014 sites like this give you a good picture of what the local environment is like.\n\nNo 13th month? Work that into your 12-month compensation. Clock too much hours? Document and be ready to speak up for yourself or walk away. \n\nAs a manager, I see too often subourdinates whining away and *doing nothing* to try to make the circumstances more favourable for themselves. The real irony is that if they\u2019d flagged an adverse situation and come to me with a solution that allows me to course-correct without compromising business goals, they would actually walk away with a few new things that work in their favour. \n\nEqually, I\u2019ve hired people who could tell me what they want from the organisation during the interview over *yes* men/women who would agree to anything to get the job. \n\nI\u2019ll turn it around and ask what do you want out of a job. A salary is the value of your output for the organisation right now. Work experience is the value you command in the job (after the next one). \n\nTake a stand or walk away.

It\u2019s something you need to get used to traveling on the public transport system with a folding bike. Also, there are different types of folding bikes which would make it easier for you to travel around with, such as the trifold ones like brompton, 3sixty, pikes as compared to bifold ones like dahon, fnhon, camp, java etc. However the trifold ones cost more. \n\nPersonally it would be easier to travel on trains as compared to bus as there\u2019s more space on trains. I would recommend getting a 14-inch that is small and lightweight for your 8-year old which he should be able to push it on his own. Alternatively, you can consider getting a bicycle bag for you to carry it instead while pushing your own."

I like planning route that ends at the beginning of mrt line so cfm have place to put. Cycle anywhere n end at marina bay for example.\nHas seen father n son 2 folding bikes going into bus on saturday evening. Father carried the bikes in via middle bus door just like wheelchair.\nEasiest bike to bring mrt is those china bikes with a triangle stand right under the seat. What we do is just fold mid frame once, no need to fold handlebar and push thru mrt. We have 16 and 20 inch. For brompton 3sixty style the cons is we have to keep an eye on it at all time due to expensive, so cannot just lock outside n go buy groceries or something, so really gotta plan route and pit stos properly.\nCarousell is your best bet for 3sixty, 900 to 1400. Make sure try and see if u comfortable in term of cycling position. We find 3sixty straight handle uncomfortable due to short arms and upgrade $50 to M bar."

I would love to own at least a Toyota or sth for my family in future.\n\nTruth is if you don't see the need to then you can just skip it. Can go anywhere in SG on pub transport. If ever a gal tells you, no car no date then just skip her LOL."

There is no real need to go learn if there is no ready car to drive etc. unless you plan to drive rental car/shared car, your driving skills will get rusty and you don\u2019t get to hone your road reading skills. Depending on how you are as a person, some people find it discouraging that after a few years of passing the test they still don\u2019t have the confidence to go on the road and give up totally (or be a hazard to the rest of road users). I would say go for it only if you see yourself driving in the v near future. Otherwise wait till a time when you see yourself needing the skill."

They even have theory practise questions akin to 10 year series, if u can get the questions right, u can pass the 2 theory tests (without studying, just book practice sessions and drill yourself) \n3) private students don\u2019t have the same level of access to the \u201c10 year series\u201d, are at the mercy of the driving school if they wish to book practical classes at the circuit and slots for their practical test. \n4) school instructors teaches you what the traffic police (testers) are looking for, essentially if you follow the instructions (to the tee) technically it\u2019s quite difficult to get things wrong (I\u2019m the product of the system, some habits die hard (which my husband and other driver friends can\u2019t stand))\n5) BBDC has the highest passing rate (I must admit BBDC doesn\u2019t have the same stress factors as the ones at Ubi) \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure private instructors teaches the most practical and efficient way of driving and are way more affordable, just that popular private instructors are harder to get and because I\u2019m a chaotic person, I appreciate the structure. Hope the info helps, just realised I\u2019m getting way more long-winded along the way  \ud83d\ude05."

Things like eating, using the washroom or even being on public transport, this is like one of our few times where we can take a break from the things that we are doing so it's understandable. \nI won't really say it's an addiction to me because I'm guilty of the things that you mentioned (prolly not on the more attractive part) \nbut if needed I can don't use my phone and be totally fine w it! (Not for a very long time bc I need a channel to communicate w my friends and families) .This prolly doesn't apply to the elder people as they have been living their childhood / teenage years without a device hence they're more able to make do without it?

They said that it's crazy that everyone regardless of age is glued to their phones (I've never noticed because that's what I grew up in, so I just thought they're being dramatic). That is, until I moved. And now that I'm accustomed to how it is here, I do find that Singaporeans are more stuck to our phones than here in Germany at least.\n\nBut I think a large factor of that is that we're so busy? We're in a constant rush to/from work/school, and we know once we get there we'll be busy with homework/work/housework. So we take whatever time we can get in the commute to 1. Connect with friends, 2. Catch up on social media, 3. Watch shows/dramas\n\nReally it's just us being super productive! \n\n(p.s. In laws were very impressed that even without taking our eyes off the screen of our phones, we are able to manouvre our way thru thr public transport without so much as bumping into others. Which people here is apparently too stupid. You'd think they see how big the sidewalk is and space themselves out but nahhh.. Dumdums)"

You're looking at maybe 3M to 5M for a 3-bedder within walking distance of the MRT. If you're willing to consider something slightly older, I do see a unit (built 1997) going for 2.3M right now. So it is possible, but your options will be limited simply due to the small supply and the popularity of the neighbourhood. \n\nIt's easy to get groceries delivered (Amazon Fresh and Redmart amongst others), so if you remove the supermarket criterion, you can look into the developments around Farrer Park MRT especially d'Leedon. If you're ok with slightly older developments, that opens up significantly more possibilities in that neighborhood too. A budget of 2.2 to 2.6M should get you someplace comfortable.\n\nMoving westwards along the Circle Line will get you the Buona Vista, One North and Kent Ridge neighbourhoods all of which do not have many condominiums available within short walking distance of the respective MRT stations. They're mostly around at least 15 to 20 minutes walk away. At least you'd have no problems finding supermarkets and eateries around here.\n\nFurther west at Haw Par Villa MRT, you have a sizeable cluster of apartments (more if you are willing to walk up Pasir Panjang Hill) but you wouldn't have food and groceries nearby. Likewise for Pasir Panjang MRT. \n\nThere aren't (m)any residences at Labrador MRT at all.\n\nYou do have a few more options available at Telok Blangah MRT (like Skyline Residences) and Harbourfront MRT (Carribean and Corals at Keppel). A 3 bedder would cost you around 2.5 to 3.3M at these places. Of the two locations, Harbourfront is better as it's where Vivocity and Sentosa are of course. At Telok Blangah you have a more local vibe as you have HDB and hawker centres close by."

I\u2019d like you to look into Normanton park - it\u2019s an upcoming development bounded by a nature park and short distance away from Kent ridge mrt (which has a hospital & mall with decent enough options), and connectivity to Buona Vista station one stop away. It\u2019s access to Holland village without the bustle and almost living within a nature park. (The houses need to be checked in person to ensure the sound from the highway doesn\u2019t bother you - the unit I lived in before it got torn down had zero noise at that time). Your nearest wet market will be the gim moh one, not inconvenient.\n\nDollar wise, setting aside housing purchase, I\u2019d think you\u2019d need at least 250k to meet that lifestyle just barely. Sending your kids to public school, renting outside city and cooking at home drives costs down quite drastically. You will miss fresh food unless you pay top dollar almost all produce is shipped from overseas.\n\nThe one you asked about - I think your estimate for education is bang on.

The older HDBs are larger too, which might mee the square footage in mind. \n\nThe downside is the lack of condo facilities, but public housing is pretty great and a good location will have amenities like gyms/pools etc. nearby. And if security is the concern - well, public housing in Singapore is probably one of the safest ones in the world.\n\nAlso, OP won't be able to live in the 'expat bubble' because of the 8-11% foreigner HDB quota, which isn't a bad thing imho. I've had a UK colleague rent a HDB and really integrate a lot better into local culture than other expats."

Like what you suggested, we plan to first rent for a period of time to find out how much we enjoy the life in SG, and which neighborhoods would suit our lifestyle better. With that being said, it would still be good to know beforehand what life quality is to be expected before the relocation. From the discussions here, it seems safe to budget a monthly expense of roughly $5k+ for rent, or $8k+ for a 25-year mortgage for a relatively comfortable life.\n\nAs far as I understand, apartment complexes entirely dedicated to rental and managed by a company are almost not existent in SG. And from what I saw on propertyguru, a lot of the listed properties there are currently tenanted. I think this adds a layer of insecurity if renting. But I totally agree that economically speaking, buying and selling within a few years most likely leads to money loss.

You don\u2019t get it because you qualify, it\u2019s entirely at the discretion of the SG gov\u2019t and they don\u2019t advertise what they are looking for.

Its also safer to stand still then moving towards the door while the bus is moving.

Now I am married and have kids and I'm motivated to work to look after them. \n\nI'm surprised though that there's really nothing you enjoy - what about movies/tv-shows, video/pc games? I feel like even if I've had the worst week at work, I can watch a cool action movie and escape away to another world for 2 hrs. And I've spent many, many hours gaming, which I really enjoy. Does none of that work for you? \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry you're feeling so down about things - i hope that you can hang on for a bit until things can become clearer for you in terms of what you value/enjoy - i really feel that over time you'll develop this self awareness, and then it'll be much easier to be motivated and prioritise how u spend your time."

Here are some things you can do to stop being a wage cuck as soon a possible: \n\n1. List down all your assets (savings, cpf, investments etc.) and liabilities (debt, mortgage, etc.). I do this on an excel spreadsheet. Calculate your net worth by subtracting liabilities from your assets. Do this every quarter. It gives you an accurate picture of your financial health. \n\n2. Track all your expenses in detail for 2 months. This will give you a better idea of where and how you're spending your money. You might think you know, but you don't. So do it. \n\n3. Start saving. If you start saving $500 a month from the age of 25 you will have around 450k by age 65 assuming a 3% annual compound interest rate. That's fucking shit. Try to do better. I lived with my parents, meal prepped and had 0 social life when I started working at 21 just so I could save almost all of my $3000 salary. \n\n4. Have an emergency fund. I do 12 months worth of cash that'll allow me to sustain my current lifestyle.\n\n5. Learn the basics of investing. To be honest I'm fucking lazy about this shit so I do the bare minimum by parking most of my savings after the emergency fund in an income portfolio on Stashaway that gives me a 3-4% return. \n\n5. You can invest the $$$ in your cpf ordinary account after 20k I think.  I haven't gotten to this yet personally coz I'm lazy af. \n\nAnyone can do all this. You literally have no excuse. Quit bitchin and maybe go see a therapist if you can coz you sound depressed af."

But lets be brutally honest here...\n\nFrom the short span of time you've spent on this thread, it seems to me like you are a self-absorbed, egotisical person who doesnt care about anyone else.\n\nNothing gives you enjoyment? Seems like you actually 'enjoy' putting others down with the most cynical views you can muster. You shoot down every \"helpful\" comment, and scorn the people who try to offer help. To the less perceptive, your terms of \"wage cuck\" may seem to be referring to yourself, but its a title you proudly brandish to mock the people that have accepted this life.\n\nThe folks here are a tad too nice. They fall prey to cynicism easily.\n\nYou enjoy knowing that other people are suffering? I could not express the term \"self-absorbed\" in better terms.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. It's all about You. You dont care about anyone else accept yourself. The whole \"masturbation is the only thing that gives joy\" is a perfect example in the quest for self-pleasure above the needs of all others.\n\nYou wear the fake smiles to people who know you, but under the shelter of digital anonymity the mask falls off and you couldnt care about anyone else's 'feelings'.\n\nTake a minute from your busy schedule of narcissistic thoughts to think about someone else instead of yourself.\n\nYou're a deep thinker, you cant find any meaning because you've got the wrong idea that life is only for your own self pleasure and enjoyment.\n\nHow can you help someone who doesnt want to be helped?\n\nThe solution isnt how people can help you. In fact, it's the complete reverse. What can YOU do to help the people around you now? Even in your current cirumstance.\n\nI was in a similar situation. Depression for 2 years with suicidal thoughts. Counselling was bearable at best. The world seemed pathetic, bleak and meaningless. But I managed to break out of the bubble and stop being so full of myself when I realized I was hurting the people around me and destroying their lives, when I should have been the pillar to keep them together. And with that realization manifest into action, everything became better. And I mean REALLY better...\n\nLife takes a new meaning when it isnt all about you. When the motivation for your actions isnt self-pleasure, but the well being of others. The quest for self-happiness can only be achieved when you pull others up. Not the reverse.\n\nI challenge you to think about others (especially the people you're closed to) for a change. It's not easy, but it'll make you feel much better than right now. What have you got to lose anyway?\n\nThe people who are stuck in depression are those who cant get over the fact that they're stuck in depression... slaves to their own minds.\n\nDont be a depression cuck (: You can make the right choice... or not. Makes no difference... I'm just another stranger on the internet."

This is significant as despite his distaste for such work, he continued to do it instead of killing himself.\n\nAs a direct result of those choices, assuming the Singaporean economy/labour distribution is at least somewhat efficient, Wage Cuck's life has been a tangible boon to our society in some way. Perhaps the Wage Cuck would not like to imagine that the results of his labour is paying the tuition of his Wage Master's spoiled children, or contributing to the tax dollars that pad the Minister's pockets. Indirectly, but still causationally, there is a poor university student pay his student debt (through tuition fees) or a new government payout that his labour/life partially contributed to.\n\nIn this regard, even if Wage Cuck does not recognise it, his existence is a definitive boon to society (and general human kind). He may die refusing to acknowledge it, but that is the facts of his past actions.\n\nWith regards to the would be kind souls out there. It is just my opinion, but I do not think the Wage Cuck (in general) does not need our pity, our guilt and definitely not our middle class biased advice that do not seem suitable for their life contexts. Neither do they need our openly acknowledged gratitude (I believe they are too bitter for that).\n\nI think instead we should treat them with a healthy degree of... Neither respect nor fear is the rifht word here. More of the awareness that without them, that if they killed themselves, we happy folk would be significantly less happy as we would no longer be able to benefit through their painful labour.\n\nJust my thoughts."

But I want to point out that what motivates most people around the world to keep working despite how hopeless or unhappy they are would be the fact that they have the above mentioned things to keep them going.\n\nYou might as well quit your current job that brings you so much misery and find a menial or self-employed job where people wouldn\u2019t be so superficial or engage you in conversations that you hate so much. (Because they are too busy trying to make ends meet) The lost in income probably won\u2019t matter much, since you don\u2019t have any interests or hobbies to spend it on. Even if I gave you unlimited funds and free you from being a \u2018wage cuck\u2019, you\u2019ll slowly return to being a miserable person because there\u2019s nothing meaningful for you to do and you\u2019ll be bored eventually."

No one in all actually gives a damn about you, unless close friends and family. That too also sometimes, own family and friends may not care about you (if let\u2019s say someone who isn\u2019t on good terms / has a stable relationship with the relationships they already have) \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is self absorbed. Depression comes in many forms and even emotions. Anger, pain, hatred, trauma, sadness, being void, etc etc. \n\nI sense that OP is materialistic and he isn\u2019t 100% wrong. Money does make the world go round (to a certain extent) You need money for a lot of things. If you have money, you can have the best life you can get (luxuries and even healthcare to a certain extent) \n\nWhen you were talking about being a deep thinker, OP isn\u2019t thinking of self pleasure and enjoyment. He already stated that he doesn\u2019t feel any enjoyment in almost anything. If he did have self pleasure and enjoyment, there wouldn\u2019t be a purpose in OP\u2019s post. \n\nRight now I\u2019m being judgemental, but it seems that you\u2019re judging OP based of your own experience in depression. I too struggled with depression almost all my life, but everyone\u2019s experiences are different. \n\nI think OP just feels tired that he\u2019s being someone else because he has to follow this \u201ccertain cycle.\u201d As in another comment I made, he needs to see a therapist to make his situation better."

I was fucking miserable when I was spending the same as you per month to save for a BTO with my ex that I was mostly bank rolling. He dumped me and I had this revelation that this imagined wonderful future that I was saving and making myself miserable in the process for just went poof and most of life is just like that, unpredictable af. Now I spend some money on wine, make up, content subscriptions, charities and some random crap each month and I am very much happier for it."

What makes things worse is the fact that it's that she blatantly lied about violating the laws and tried to put the blame on you. In this situation, it's because she is unable to take criticism and she becomes overly defensive and pushes the blame because she knows that she doesnt have any substance or argument on her part which is why she pushes the blame to you.\n\nHowever, while your sister is indeed being selfish, I feel that OP should adopt a different approach instead of confronting of your sister, maybe try to be understanding as everyone is stressed out during these tough times and it's quite a drastic adjustment period for everyone. So maybe instead of direct confrontation (even though you have all the facts against her), try to be understanding and look at this not from a right or wrong standpoint but as a sister who loves and shows care and concern for her fellow family member.\n\nif we can apply compassion and kindness during these times, there is no doubt, that we will come out stronger together.\n\nEveryone has a part to play and as long as we commit to these measures, I am sure we will all prevail not only as individuals but as a community/country as a whole."

My oldest sister's weren't aloud to date till they were adults, same with me(youngest male) and my brother's; though my parents were more relaxed with us boys. In general we didn't talk to our parents about anything dating/sex life related. Partially due to my parents relationship with their parents, and also the fact that we were not aloud to date just stopped the conversations from happening.\n\nI think your parents have put a big strain on you and your sisters relationship. It is a big problem for you and your sister and makes it hard on you having to mediate for you parents. My sister's fought for the same reasons but more so because my oldest sister felt that if she didn't get to then my sister couldn't. And I'm sad to say my oldest sister felt like she had so much burden, she left the family and no one has seen her in years.\n\nREMEDY: Read 'The Mastery of Love' by Miguel Ruiz\n\nThis book will explain better than I can that neither you or your sister are at fault, yet both of you are. You are two different people seeing different points if view, picking different battles. You have to except people for who they are, and except that you won't always understand their choices. You can only chose your response.\n\nShe's 24, you can give her your opinion, but don't tell her what to do. You'll never get someone to agree with you if you back them into a corner(Another great book is 'Getting to yes' how to let people see your point but make their own decisions instead of fighting to win an argument). And search your heart; Are you just concerned for her well being? or do you feel like she gets away with more than you did? She is an adult, by law, she can go stay at her boyfriends for a month, and deal with the fallout with your parents. But if she wants to be supported by your parents, she should live by their rules, and learn to talk to them like you do. Stop being the middle man, you're not helping, be a mediator for them, a bridge.\n\nI was pretty young when my sister left, and she is so hot tempered, I often think she's better off finding her own way. But I have 3 other siblings and we do disagree. It's life. You just have to work on love if you want it to exist in your life. And except when you can't understand someone and let them make their own choices\n\n  \n\n\nGood luck!"

                "comment": "I think this situation is actually quite complicated, although, it is quite clear that your sister is quite selfish about this. The law explicitly states what is illegal and what isn't, especially at such a crucial point of time for us as a country, we are literally depending on one another to be responsible for our safety. \n\nBut, I think its more than that. I might be wrong but I'm gna hazard a guess that your sister and her bf are probably younger(?) maybe in their teens? They don't sound like they can think rationally, and are driven by their hormones. I say that since she knows and agrees that your parents won't allow her to stayover for a month,  and if they were more mature, they would understand the sacrifice they have to make in this period, and find a way to make it work. I've seen so many couples share about how they don't like it, but for the sake of complying and for the society in general, they abide by the rules. Considering this, I don't think you'll actually be able to understand her point of view, she isn't thinking rationally, and she probably does not have the wisdom and experience that comes with age. \n\nSo i'd say she's in the wrong, but then again, at her age, it isn't exactly abnormal behavior, UNLESS of course she turns out to be in her mid twenties-thirties, then something is probably seriously wrong with her emotional/mental health, and she is just inherently selfish, - not realising the world does not revolve around her and her boyfriend. All this is based on assumptions of course. If she is actually older than I assumed, then I would just narrow it down to selfishness, and being unable to see beyond herself. \n\nEither way, it is a tricky situation, but still could have been handled more tactfully. Can be quite frustrating, but what I would have done would have been to ask her to talk to your parents about staying over with her bf from the start. It seems like she either does not understand how serious the pandemic is, or simply doesnt care. If she doesnt understand (which is quite unlikely), I'd try to get her to understand that, and the risk not complying brings to people she cares about. If she doesn't care, honestly i dont think that much can be done."

No flights to my country which is in full lockdown. Even if I get out somehow, MOM has made it clear that I cannot come back any time soon. So at this moment I have no clue when I will hold him again. Your sister can surely survive a month without seeing her boyfriend. \n\nAlso, how old are your parents? It is incredibly selfish for her to go out now when she is living with your parents. Just today I read a news about a pregnant lady who went into premature labor and lost her baby due to covid. These are the people we are staying home for. If there is any country we can safely be in lockdown it's Singapore. You have a roofing, food at your door stop, air-conditioning, high speed internet and what not. She doesn't realize the privilege. In my country, homeless people and daily wage labors were stranded in the streets and walked thousands of kilometers to be in their village. \n\nMaybe it was wrong you invaded her privacy. But try talking to her calmly and make her understand why it is important to stay at home now. It's really not about her. It's about the vulnerable people around her."

Im not sure whether you are the elder sister or younger sister,\nIf you are younger, just let your parent do the scolding part if they disagree with her moving with the boyfriend. I as a elder sister, found it humiliating when my younger sis trying to lecture me. It just made me feel horrible and embarassed. That feeling is unbearing, it hurts more when what she said was right and subconsciously I would try to argue or disregard it. Sometimes I myself dont understand it either, I thought I was angry, but after doing alot of self reflection, I think feeling hurt is the reason for the anger. Sometimes you need to see deeper, the reason for the anger. It might not be related to what is going on infront only. Like, when I'm having  bad day with my loved one, I get irritated easily during work without realizing I wasn't angry over the matter in front but it's about other thing in mind.\nWhat I am trying to say is, it doesn't matter who is right or wrong. It doesn't matter who started lying and who was at fault. As a sibling, you really need to ask yourself if you want this to work between you. You mentioned she wasn't disturbed at home and left doing her own stuff and it's suffocating. Maybe that's why. Maybe being left alone with no one to talk to is suffocating. Maybe she only feel cared when she's with her boyfriend, someone who understand her and made her feel at ease. Or maybe she has some issue in relationship with her boyfriend that made her feel insecure from being apart too long.\nThere are millions possible reason.\n\nIf you don't really care about her, just want to make your life easier, then just don't care ar. Let her be, why make yourself angered and upset?\nShe can do whatever she wants, if she's danger to family for bringing virus outside, let her move to her boyfriend's house. If your parent dont like that idea, then let them be the one doing the scolding.\nWhy do you care so much bout her lying and breaking the laws. It's not like you can really report her anyway. That will ruins your relationship with her, which you did already by bringing it up about reporting :3\nIt's kinda hurtful lol not that what you said was wrong.\nIt's very nice of you being the responsible citizen, kudos for that. But other than being the citizen of Singapore, you are also her sister, her family.\nHaving a bad relationship with a sister, who you see everyday, is simply mentally exhausting.\n This might sound horrible, but I would rather dealing with my sister being caught or fined by police one day, than having to quarel with her every single days. As it will be her own fault and she need to be responsible for her own doing. I would ve given her my piece of advice but she 's free to make her own decisions. I wouldn' t scold her afterward either, saying things like \"I told you so\", \"see why you no listen to me\" if she don't recognize her own mistakes, there is no point of me saying anything, if she already knows her mistake, I don't need to add salt to it, she feels horrible enough. Dont get me wrong, I love my sister. But the way I love her is not by  teaching her how to be a resposible human being but is to make her feel supported and loved.\n\nIf your main concern is that she might bring virus home,  there is alot of things can be done, such as giving her a mask when she s outside, make her shower immediately when she's home, using a different chopsticks when sharing food etc\nThese could be done easily, in a light hearted way had you guys been in a good relationship :3\nSince now you are in bad relationship, letting her move is the most straight forward method.\n\nMaybe you need to ask yourself what do you want exactly? Proving that she s wrong? Why?\nDon't want her to harm society and family?\nOr do you care about her? \nCoz knowing your own intention will make it easier for you to make decision. \n\nInstead of saying \"why are you meeting your boyfriend?\" since people get defensive when put into corner and feel like being interrogated.  Describe your own intention or feeling might work better\n\"I see you are going out, I'm actually very worried and concern that what if you accidentally caught the virus and be sick or what if it infected our parent. I'm scared\"\nOr\n\"i dont really give a f about you but im really upset and disappointed that you put our family in danger.\"\nLol"

I told her what my parents said, reiterated the part about social responsibility and she decided to come back home because she herself didn't want to sour her relations with her parents. The only thing I 'forced' her about was that if she decided to come back home, she shouldn't be going out to meet her boyfriend regularly because she's putting everyone at risk. She has explicitly stated that her reason for being suffocated was me, and I barely interacted with her. Now, I can understand that I would be 'suffocating' if we were actively fighting **all the time**, but we were perfectly cordial to each other and even went for a walk together after dinner that night. \n\nOf course, I cared about her lying. Would it be a healthy relationship even then if I had accepted her lies at face value when it was so clearly a lie? What you are suggesting seems that if I was in a good relationship with her, I should have just supported her even when she was out breaking the law. I'm sorry, but I can't condone that. I value people who tell me when I fuck up, even when I don't want to hear it. I value honesty and integrity *a lot*, and the thought of being supportive when she is clearly doing something wrong is just not me."

Either way it'll end badly. The only thing your sister has to say about herself now is that its highly unlikely they will get covid, but can she really risk the health of your family? I don't know leh, seems like a pretty obvious choice to me. \n\nProps to you though for standing your ground though, sucks to find out your own family member can be a little b."

Although u may be stronger in terms of being harsh or \"ruling w an iron fist\" you're not the parent and never will be. Your parents need to deal w her on their own and no matter how much u wanna help them, you should not be part of the \"parenting\". \n\nAnd that's probably one reason why she feels suffocated. Another one is obviously bcos she's 24.\n\nJust some of my thoughts here, putting aside the selfishness to society and the covid situation first. I'm just looking at this in terms of family dynamics.\n\nFeel free to discuss :)"

I really think your sister should be communicating better with your parents about each other's wants and needs and drawing clearer boundaries.\n\nAs for your question about whether that's a big ask, it's gonna be a different answer on who you ask so it's best discussing that with your sister. Get to know what her gripes are about spending long periods of time in close quarters with the family and why the prospect of spending it with her bf seems more attractive.  \n\nI'm the same age as your sister so I'll add my personal 2 cents just in case you might find it relevant. I love love love my Dad and bro but I like spending planned time with them. I'll even do fucking boring shit I hate like cycling or drinking smelly whiskeys but I'll only do it for the 1-2 hours we agreed upon and bond with them to the max but then afterwards they get on my nerves. I can't talk about things I'm interested in like ru paul's drag race or programming with them like I can with my bf and friends and I get v annoyed when they binge drink and play FIFA in the living room. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, these are tough times and family is important but we also can't choose our family even though we love them very much and in the interest of everyone's well being it's better to communicate our needs and come to a middle ground rather than trying to impose our wills on each other coz that's just going to lead to conflict and unhappiness."

I only agreed to live with them in the first place coz I see them once a week at most. I love them and they love me but we just don't understand each other's needs very well. Can't pick family right? On the other hand, I'm very intentional with picking friends and significant others precisely because of issues like this. Like I have my own work area at my bf's place where he don't disturb me and we pre agree on time slots to do things together."

PUB usually cost 50 bucks, more during autumn-winter and summer. bunking into a hostel might cost more coz you get own room, with sharing amenities. \n\nyou're talking about culture. you gotta understand that it's depend on whom you're hanging around with. SGans tend to stick with SGans. few will break the circles and get friends with overseas students. different cultures, different habits. i can talk this for hours and will never end. in any case, it's pretty rare you will get to 'absorb' the local culture.  racism? one day if you're lucky, you will come across someone throw a remark 'true blue australian' in your face. sound familiar? yes. that's exactly what Singaporeans do to non Singaporeans here."

US citizens are typically issued a 90-day short term visit pass (\"tourist visa\"). If you're going in and out a few times in just one week, it's obvious that you're not just trying to \"renew\" the tourist visa. They might look closer if you stayed mostly in SG for 89 days, then went on a weekend trip to Malaysia, and tried to come back."

For instance, in Texas, where I live, some people are outright snarky and confrontational because they see it as \"weak\" and \"hippy liberal new world order\" or whatever to wear a mask.

                "comment": "Public space\nYes, we are allowed outside. We are currently not under lockdown, but certain groups of people are either advised to stay home or are strictly no allowed outside, such as those who have returned from other countries have to serve a 14-day Leave of Absence at home, those who have come into close contacts with confirmed cases will be under strict quarantine, and those who show respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore, throat or fever are given a 5-day medical certificate and required to stay at home for the whole duration. \n\nThe government has assured us that public transport is still fully functional and have been regularly disinfecting public places. You can read more on government efforts to keep Singapore clean here.\n\n\nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/how-are-public-spaces-being-kept-clean-during-this-period\n\n\nGetting checked\nA typical Singaporean would get checked for symptoms of COVID-19 at a PHPC or Public Health Preparedness Clinic. If mild, the doctor will give the patient a 5-day medical certificate and advise them to monitor their health closely, but if severe/the patient\u2019s symptoms worsen, the doctor will refer the patient to a hospital to get tested. As of now, I am not sure what technology they use and how the testing is done, but one thing that I am sure of is that testing is free of charge.\n\nLearning from the past\nA quote from Minister Leong Hoe Nam: \u201cSARS turned out to be a blessing for Singapore. We realized how infectious diseases spread and how we have to be on top of the curve,  in terms of quarantining and surveillance, and being aware and having the diagnostic kits, as well as the health care workers all ready. That SARS experience has prepared us for the current epidemic. And if you look at it, Singapore is emerging out of this epidemic earlier than expected. We have controlled most cases and all of this comes from the roots from SARS. We actually see the government being proactive. We actually see the people being cooperative with the government.\u201d\n\nI personally do not have much to comment on about this topic, but if you would like to read more the link is here[...](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-03-02/covid-19-lessons-singapore-and-how-it-handled-sars)\n\nMedical personnel\nHaving no firsthand experience as a medical worker, I am unable to comment much on this topic either. However, Singapore\u2019s hospitals are definitely well equipped with medical equipment. When dealing with confirmed cases, our healthcare workers wear full-body protective gear, including goggles, N95 masks, and hazmat-style suits.  There is currently no shortage of surgical masks either, as the government has informed us that these masks are not necessary for our personal protection, they are for people who feel unwell to use so they may not infect other people. \n\n\nContact tracing\nSingapore has ramped up its contact tracing efforts by having 20 contact tracing teams instead of just 3. In schools, students have been made to sit in fixed, exam-style seatings to reduce intermingling, and if lessons are held with students of different classes the students are to be seated in groups(within their classes). Teachers are to take pictures of every seating arrangement for the sole purpose of contact tracing. At our Community Centres, we are also made to scan QR codes and give our names, identification numbers, mobile numbers, and declare we have not had any contact with suspected cases or those on LOA.The government has also recently developed an app just for contact tracing named TraceTogether. Here it is.\n\nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/help-speed-up-contact-tracing-with-tracetogether\n\n\n[FAQs](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs) for your reference. \n\n\nIf you would like to learn about Singapore\u2019s strategies in more detail, I recommend visiting the government website at www.gov.sg.

Any alternatives? Would help a lot in the \"not getting lost\" part.\n\nWhere are you putting up for the period in Singapore? There is the MRT (Metro/ Tube) which is pretty convenient to get around if you want to save some $. Alternatively, you can use Uber or GrabTaxi to get a ride. Do indicate that you want to get a pickup at the Departure instead of arrival, it is easier for the drive to find where you are. Eg Exit 1 of Terminal 2\n\n> I have the following things in my mind: Gardens by the Bay, the night zoo, Orchard rd, Sentosa (??? I will probably see some of it while going back-n-forth to ZoukOut), Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown, Little India. Any suggestions regarding my picks? I know it's not much of an \"itinerary\", but I didn't have a lot of free time to plan this trip.\n\nLittle India is fine, but do note that most foreign low wage workers from India / Sri Lanka / Bangladesh  (working in construction) usually spend their weekends in Little India. It get's pretty chaotic due to the influx of people.\n\nDo visit Chinatown in the earlier half of the day. Lots of tourist shops and stuff to look at (Hindu Temple, Chinese Temple). If you like a day tour + finding out about our History (Food History) you can click [here](https://www.viator.com/tours/Singapore/Singapore-Hawker-Center-Food-Tour-in-Chinatown/d18-6458SING1)\n\n> Also, on a different note: Any tips from veteran ZoukOut-ers? From Friday night, to Sunday morning I will be partying there, and I've heard a lot of good, but also bad things about the experience. Are the queues really that bad everywhere? Are the drink & food prices out of proportions? I've read some Facebook reviews, and this is all I could get out of it, and I didn't really like it, but what can you do...\n\nWater is served around $8-10 a bottle. (Last time i went was in '12) Queues are ok and pretty orderly. I recommend that you drink alcohol only towards the end / the last 2 sets else you'll get gassed pretty quickly. Just bring $200 and you can be covered for almost anything.\n\n> What about transport to-and-from Sentosa to the city? I will be staying on Dickson Road, which is pretty close to Little India stop on the MRT map. Is the public transport system working day & night?\n\nYou take the MRT to Harbourfront and you take the skytrain on the [third floor of Vivocity to Sentosa](http://staging.sentosa.com.sg/en/getting-around/sentosa-express/), get off at the Beach Station, its a 10 minutes walk from there.\n\nTransport system work both day and night. Last MRT is in between 12-1am. Then it's taxi / Grab / Uber after that.\nIt is pretty safe here, walking around at 3am won't get you mugged. There are lots of supper spots near your place of stay.\n\nOnce the party ends, there will be free shuttle buses from Sentosa -> Harbourfront. I recommend that you bring a singlet + small face towel so you can freshen up yourself before you leave the place\n\n > Oh and another thing... Sadly, from where I come, it's not unusual that tourists get scammed, so this is why I'm asking the following: any special things that I should keep an \"extra eye on\"? or any places NOT to go?\n\nDo not buy electronics from [Sim Lim Square](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/blogs/going-out-by-day/sim-lim-cheating-vendors-named-shamed-080508598.html) unless you know what you want and the RRP of the product. Another places to avoid is Lucky Plaza too. If you intend to get electronics, drop me a PM, i can advise where is a place you can go to.\n\nThere is no place not to go in Singapore, just don't be a sucker and get taken for a ride. You see that lady beckoning you for a drink at a Karaoke TV pub, you better know how much you gonna pay before blindly ordering stuff.\n\nIf you are into trannies, Orchard Plaza is the place for you.\nIf you are into standard prostitution, Geylang is where you want to go. Do note that the streetwalkers are illegal prostitutes. Legal ones are in brothels and typically cost more.\n\nIf you want to know about stuff in Singapore, you can post here or ask on /r/Singapore too\n\nParty hard, party smart. Welcome to Singapore."

Many nice bars/pubs to chill or have a nice dinner at. For sightseeing/shopping, you may also visit Haji Lane, which is in Kampong Glam. It is rows of shophouses selling clothing/\"hipster\" items.

A cup of beer costs about $10. Most people who go to ZoukOut would buy loads of beer/drinks from the convenience store in Sentosa and drink before entering. I would suggest you do the same, or go to a bar/pub to drink before going to ZoukOut. Starker is a good option if you like beer, or FIVE bar for other types of alcohol.\n\nThe queue wasn't bad when I went to Zoukout 2 years ago.\n\n>What about transport to-and-from Sentosa to the city?

Are those in SGD or USD, by the way?\nOh and a totally random and off topic question: \nI'm a software developer, I've been working for nearly 3 years for a company, and I am seriously considering moving to a country from SEA. Singapore would be an obvious choice, but would you happen to know anything about the IT market there? In Europe, especially this central/eastern part where I live, everybody is hunting for IT guys like me, but I would rather go somewhere far-far away, where life isn't so boring..."

Standing in queues all night for super-expensive drinks is not my type of a party."

You can look at websites like www.jobstreet.com.sg/ or http://sg.jobsdb.com/sg\n\nDo note that cost of living here is comparable to other large cities. But if you live within your means, it's pretty fun place to work as the rest of SEA/ Taiwan is just a 2-5h flight away. If food is your thing, we have lots of stuff here. We basically live to eat, 24 hours a day, you will be able to grab food besides McDonald.\n\nIf you have more questions about moving here, you can search /r/singapore for more information as many foreigners have asked similar questions in the past.\n\n> I might have to buy some from the store, but those are usually of worse quality than the homemade traditional ones\n\nOur [Duty Free Liquor Store](http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2015/05/07/3jdbars07e_2x.jpg?itok=XH5Apq28) is nothing you have experienced before. It may be a tad pricier, eg Greygoose is around SGD$80 for 1 liter at DFS. If you want to get a gift for your friend in Vietnam, you can buy a bottle as you arrive and leave Singapore.\n"

I've been to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia before, so I know how important the food culture is in SEA, and I would think that it would be the same for Singapore as well, especially since it must have a lot of influences from all the neighbouring countries. I will look into the IT industry there, I am mostly skilled in project management related automations and the IT part of it. And about the drink: I am sure I cannot buy traditional Hungarian 'Palinka' at the duty free shop :( That would be the point of the whole thing, to bring a little bit of my culture to my friends in Vietnam. But nevermind I might try it out also. The worst thing that can happen is that I have to throw it away (I hope)."

And affects the length of many people\u2019s commute.\n\nIt\u2019s a long time ago but I remember some of my colleagues had great commutes and others long commutes.

I have stayed in RidgeView twice for camps but I was assigned  a single room so I can't give my input on em. I understand that you will be travelling to the Science faculty for lessons and it's pretty close to RidgeView too, however, if you prefer to travel by shuttle bus, it may be difficult to board at the stop at RidgeView during peak hours as many students board at the previous stop at UTown. As for double rooms in Halls, they vary in design from Hall to Hall. Perhaps you can check their websites for any photos or floor plans to get a better idea of it!\n\nWith the meal plans, Colleges have a dining hall where the food are served buffet booth style, with different cuisines like Malay, Indian, Chinese, Western. You tap your student card for a receipt and a receipt redeems you a meal, the menu changes daily for breakfast and dinner and you have tap up to 3 meal credits per breakfast/dinner. Breakfast is provided from Monday to Saturday and dinner is provided from Sunday to Friday. My friends in Hall say that their meal choices are more limited but I guess it's all a matter of the price difference of the meal plans paid.  If you want to take a look at what's served at Colleges, you can add the 'RC Meal Bot' on Telegram, they update daily for both breakfast and dinner menus. \n\nGenerally I hear that there are more exchange students staying in Colleges and Prince George Residences(PGP) than in Halls, but I feel that they are all pretty welcoming towards exchange students. For activities, Colleges have College events, House events, Interest Groups and others such as Master's Teas, Master's Forum etc. They are not compulsory so you can join whenever you're interested! Not sure about Hall activities though.\nAlright, since I'm a freshman and I am only taking LSM1105 out of your list above, I can only give you advice on it: lectures are held twice a week, no tutorials, no lab sessions, there are graded pre-lecture online quizzes uploaded the day before lectures and homework quizzes as well but they are pretty short (approx 5MCQ qns). The workload for this module is pretty light but remember to read the textbook before lectures to prep for the pre-lecture quizzes, the profs will tell you which chapter will be taught when.\n\ntip: use the NUSMods website to build your timetable so you have an idea what your workload is like, remember to set it as semester 2 on the site so the data is more accurate.\n\nhope it helps!\n"

Try [Airbnb.](https://www.airbnb.com.sg/s/Singapore-?checkin=17-07-2015&checkout=19-07-2015&guests=2&price_max=150&ss_id=52osgqva) There are a number of [hostels](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/11-awesome-hostels-singapore-under-060100307.html) available. Some of them also list on Airbnb. Hotels can be quite expensive. If the hotel you're looking at seems to charge rather low rates or offers 3-hour blocks (eg. the Hotel81 chain), it might be a love hotel.\n\nCheap public transportation - Yes. A trip to most places will cost you no more than $2 or $3. The EZ-Link card is something like $15 with $10 in stored value or something. Also consider the [singapore tourist pass](http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com.sg/about-the-passes/) if you intend to visit lots of places. Public transport stops around midnight. Past midnight, uberX might be cheaper than taking a cab. All [cabs](http://grabtaxi.com/singapore/) here go by the meter, but take note of the [surcharges](http://www.taxisingapore.com/taxi-fare/).\n\nCheap food and drink - Yes. Eat at [Hawker Centres](http://www.yoursingapore.com/editorials/a-guide-to-the-best-hawker-centres-around-the-city-centre-of-singapore.html). Most meals are under $5, non-alcoholic drinks usually under $2. Just avoid ordering anything that doesn't have a fixed price (like live seafood). If you do want to order seafood, ask for the price first. Alcohol is expensive here unfortunately, even for locals. About $12 for a bottle of beer at most watering holes. The price goes up at clubs. \n\nYour question doesn't seem to be getting much response. Feel free to ask me if you have any more questions. Maybe try asking /r/singapore."

There's an app version that you can buy but you can always just use the mobile website and it is the same thing. \n\nBut as others have said, you should factor in a wide buffer time because the bus system is very unpredictable and varies widely depending on traffic conditions. I've waited an hour at the stop for my bus before three of them arrive at the same time. But thankfully that is quite rare. \nAlso, during peak hours you may not be able to board the bus because it is filled to the brim, so you may end up having to wait for the next one 10 minutes later. And even that one might be full as well.\nGenerally I steer clear of buses whenever I can. \n\n\nThe train system is slightly more reliable because the trains arrive regularly every 3-5 minutes, but occasionally there may be delays because the train slows down or due to increasingly-common track faults. So don't expect to-the-minute accuracy like in Japan; a 10-15 minute buffer will be good. "

After lunch, perhaps head south to Sentosa island where Resort World is and either enjoy Universal Studio or S.E.A Aquarium. If you're adventurous, you may even want to explore AJ Hackett or Luge. Once nightfall, you can head back to Boat Quay or Clarke Quay area for dinner and a drink.\n\nI didn't suggest the other touristy places such as the Zoo or Botanical Garden as they're quite out of the way and you would want to spend more time in there rather than just touch-N-go.\n\nHave fun and enjoy your transit!

The Certificate of Entitlement (basically permit that allows you to own the car) is much more expensive than the car itself. Parking is expensive and will get even more so. There are many other expenses such as road tax, insurance, COE renewal etc etc. Drivers are also so rude on the roads (due to the high levels of stress here), I've met many who have a complete disregard for other's safety or just want to take out their anger on you. We're such a tiny country, we cant have everyone owning cars. Public transport is pretty good, taxi, grab, gojek are very reliable and affordable. Also, if your wife a highly skilled expat, she might likely get paid enough to afford the expensive rent in the city centre. So that cuts down on your transport time/expenses too."

From a quick internet search, you can book a [Grab Family](https://i.imgur.com/IkKw2Z8.jpg) ride (at a higher rate) and they will provide a car seat or booster suitable for children above 1 year old. Taxis are not required to provide any child restraints beyond seat belts and regular Grab rides aren't supposed to accept children less than 1.35 meters tall. So, you will have to hold your baby in your arms or drag your own car seat with you while you shop, dine out, etc. I don't have young children, so I'm hoping someone with more experience can jump in to offer further insight."

Convenience is defined as freedom to go anywhere (ie. multiple locations) at any time (especially emergencies) with as many things I can pack (ie. kids stuff) while talking / listening about anything you want in the vehicle. True, you can say that it comes at a price like maintenance and other costs. However, I do not have that feeling of limitation anymore."

IMO, fundamentally, city/ economic planning is at the core.\n\nMost SE Asian cities with lots of bikes have allowed large numbers of vehicles flocking into the city as they keep prices of cars, bikes, parking and fuel low. In this type of congested cities, bikes are good to weave through the heavy traffic and affordable to many. Congested cities aren't productive as people would be spending too much time on the road.\n\nSpreading the commercial activities in the city across a wider area to ease congestion. In a less congested city, if cars and parking remain affordable, then cars would be a preferred choice over bikes, especially in tropical climate. This is what I think is happening in Western cities.\n\nOverall, I feel that Singapore's objective, given its size, is to keep the traffic smoother to facilitate more commercial activities. Hence, keeping cost of personal transportation high and providing good mass public transportation."

Personally while it may not be worth it to buy a car, it\u2019s definitely worth it to have a license. Once you have it you don\u2019t have to do anything to maintain it (until you reach senior status) so why not have it for the times you might need it. Whether it\u2019s travelling or a short term rental in SG or even something work related where you might be asked to transport something it\u2019s the kind of thing that is good to have as an option\n\nETA I do agree that investment in aircon might be a more useful initial investment and the license could come after when you\u2019re a bit more financially secure"

Not to mention u need to fork out some cash for the initial downpayments and instalments will be a long term commitment.\n\nThe question is 1. Can you afford to comfortably pay the downpayment plus instalments with your current income 2. Whether you think it is worth it to top up that difference to own a car instead of taking public transport. Pros include more convenience esp if you have young children and if you need to go to places with less than ideal public transport frequently. Cons are in some cases taking train may be faster than driving esp when you go to CBD or Orchard. You also tend to waste time when you have to send car in for servicing, washing, grooming on regular basis.\n\nIn any case since supporting a car will form a large part of recurring expenses do think thru properly."

Otherwise, Chinatown, Balestier, or Bugis have some budget options and yet still accessible.\n\nWe don\u2019t have Uber here so you may considering downloading grab before you arrive if that\u2019s the preferred way to get around.\n\nIf you travel by taxi it is best to carry some cash, since there is a 10% surcharge on payment by cards. A typical 10 minute ride is about $10.\n\nIf you are intending to travel around free and easy, you can purchase a EZ-Link card from the transitlink office at Changi Airport. You can travel on buses and trains with that card and yes, there is a train station at our airport, just look out for the MRT sign.\n\nGoogle Maps work in Singapore so if you want to get around on our public transport you can just Google for transport instructions!\n\nYou can buy a SIM card from the airport as well, we have 3 main providers: SingTel, StarHub, M1. 3 of them provide similar prepaid SIM value and they have similar coverage and speeds, so if you are travelling to tourist attractions you shouldn\u2019t notice much of a difference.\n\nSome food you can consider to try is Bak Ku Teh, Chilli Crab, Chicken Rice. If you want to experience Singapore\u2019s style food, accessible places is Lau Pa Sat or Newton Food Centre. If you are on a budget, just Google hawker and you can go discover any hawker centre and what food they have to offer!\n\nYou can consider places to drink at Clark Quay or Boat Quay, where most of the pubs are concentrated on a river front. Do take note that Singapore have a law that prohibits drinking in public places after 10.30pm. If you are in a pub or restaurant or in your hotel it\u2019s fine, but you can\u2019t buy alcohol after 10.30pm from convenience store or supermarket as well.\n\nOh! And we have designated smoking area in Orchard Road shopping district so do take note. Smoking laws are quite strict in Singapore and cigarettes are expensive here too. Also note that if you intend to bring any cigarettes into Singapore you have to declare under Red Channel and pay tax at the airport, even if it is just 1 stick.\n\nAnyhow, I hope you find this useful! And welcome to Singapore! \ud83d\ude2c"

I'd expect the route to incorporate at least one bus but never seen a single route suggestion that told me to get on a bus. When I visited Singapore a couple of times, I've always managed to find a bus route to a place."

For now, I'm looking up routes so that I arrive at the office by 9 am, so I'll likely be getting on MRTs / buses on rush hours. I was wondering how easy is it to get on public transport during rush hour. Will I have to leave home a bit earlier incase I cant get on the MRT because its too full or are public transport generally not that full / cramped?"
