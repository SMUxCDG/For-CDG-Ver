They'd raise taxi rental on drivers and increase fare at will. \n\nIt was also super hard to get taxis. If I needed a taxi on weekends or weekday peak hours, I could wait up to 1 hour by the road cos Sengkang was supposedly very far. Most of us have forgotten the experience of standing by the road waving at taxis and them not stopping, and later when we finally caved in and call, we see the same taxis coming to pick us up. Taxis used to be such luxury and would easily cost double or more the fares today. I  only had budget for 2 taxi rides a month as a young adult\n\nUber (not Grab) changed everything!"

Try to set aside buffer time for a quick car wash just in case the car is not up to snuff. \n  \nBut for my case, I borrowed a relative's car. The car decorations came from the bridal studio where we had our pre wedding photoshoot, it was part of the package deal. The florist that did the bride's bouquet can offer solutions too.\n  \nMy small advice to give regarding wedding cars is to think about where it's parked. If it's parked in clear view of the guests as they enter, and they know it's yours, and they have the space to gawk, by all means make the car pretty. If the designated parking space isn't in a \"place of honor\" then the guests wouldn't even know the difference if the bride and groom took grab."

I genuinely can't think of any reason you wouldn't be allowed to use a normal rental car for your wedding if you just drive on the road as per normal. For decor no need to go crazy also, get some ribbon, nice gauze, flowers (can even be fake), and get the more artsy friend to ownself decor. Saves a lot."

Of course wedding car rental will be a little more expensive than the normal car rentals. \n\nAnd if i recall, normal car rentals do not normally allow you to only rent for 1 day, especially on a weekend. They will expect you to take the whole weekend. You can check out VW website as i recall they do provide 1 day rental for weddings (of course i maybe outdated). \n\nThe wedding decor comes from the bridal shop so i didnt pay any extra for it. Or you can diy yourself which is rather cheap. You just need some cable ties and tapes (and flowers of course!)\n\nNot sure if i answered your question."

Most of Europe and Asia follow the same system as Singapore. \n\nIf you're wondering because you're going to the US or UK, you're pretty much stuck with what the hire company offers you. My parents get hosed on car rental insurance when they visit me in Canada or go to the US/UK on leisure (corporate rates usually include insurance), paying typically $30 per day for liability and basic collision.\n\nIn comparison, US/Canadian car owners typically get liability insurance in both countries from their personal auto insurance policies and most credit cards have collision coverage on rentals.

If you drive to 1-2am you might even get $90-$100. **This is before deducting petrol and rental cost**\n\n> I assume the surge pricing factors a lot into your earned income. What % of your income comes from ferries then and what % comes from the respective incentive schemes?\n\nGiven that I have 45 incentive trips to meet for my weekday incentive, I would get $95, $120 or even $150 if I met the incentive trips. I don't take into account boost or surge pricing because they are variable.\n\n> Aside from car rental and petrol costs, what are your other expenses?\n\nCar wash. Vehicle repairs for scratches.\n\n> When signing up for either company, any key things to look out for?\n\nRead what you're signing up for. Pay attention to the briefings. Many private hire drivers make up their own rules as they go along - like _I must follow GPS for uberpool rides_ which is BS.

You may remember other posts such as the [monkey stealing bread from the North Spine bakery](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/n7njyx/monkey_brazenly_stealing_bread_at_north_spine/), or the other [monkey stealing cup noodles at Crespion halls.](https://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/monkey-steals-cup-noodles-in-ntu-then-scales-railing-to-open-it?fbclid=IwAR2MCPku30-HVB5bZRbpg-F1AanRS-2gJhcgjejscNj7w_d0kwE_y39pvHY#xtor=CS1-10)\n\nThroughout last semester, there have been several occasions where these macaques have invaded students' rooms by sliding open the mosquito net and causing havoc inside, digging through plastic bags and ripping packets of food, defecating on the table, etc. (of course I'm complaining because I myself kena)\n\nJust talking to friends who stay in the NH halls area, it has basically become a \"norm\" seeing someone's room get raided or seeing monkeys camping the Cates food delivery drop-off point table.\n\nThere were several occasions where the monkeys would even appear at lift lobbies on upper floors of the halls to dig through the rubbish bins. The issue had escalated to the point where these monkeys were completely unafraid of people (would invade rooms even with people inside, would attempt to open bags at the NH playground even with adults and children there)\n\nUp til now, I still get updates that these monkeys have continued to wander common areas of NH halls.As for what have the school has done about it, they set up the \"long-tailed macaque committee\" to address this issue. Their first few actions were to change regular rubbish bins to monkey-proof bins (basically a bin with a latch that monkeys would not be able to easily open), and to set up signs in common areas that tell you not to provoke monkeys and to keep your windows closed at all times.\n\nThe tough part would be that with how tiny the NH rooms are, closing the outside-facing windows cut off so much air circulation that it makes staying in the room difficult if you didn't have air conditioning (even with the inside-facing privacy window open).\n\nI imagine that one of the fastest and most effective solutions would be to install locks on the mosquito netting panels so that they would not be easily slid open. (Due to the design, even something simple such as jamming the window tracks with a long removable object would theoretically work). Yet hall administration has yet to do anything significant about monkey room invasions apart from hosting dialogue sessions and \"monkey walks\".\n\nI believe Earthlink (environmental club) have been trying to address some of these issues to escalate to administration recently, but for now we have still been brushed off by administration to \"hide any plastic bags from view\" and \"keep all windows closed\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** monke messing with North Hill Residents, admin says suffocate in your rooms"

                "comment": "With regards to the NTU shuttle buses, I get the impression that the university management as a whole does not treat them with enough importance to run the services in a coherent manner. It appears that the management is happy to let students rely on the SBS Transit buses 179 and 199 plying through the campus, and the internal shuttle is mostly an afterthought.\n\nA key problem I have with the system is that **none** of the routes have a proper terminal to start and end. The closest you all have to a terminal is a haphazardly paved patch of land near the Graduate Halls where the buses park. This \"terminal\" is located not quite along the route but in between bus stops, so buses have to end at Saraca (Blue) or Hall 10 (Red) while starting from Opp Hall 10 (Blue) or the Grad Halls (Red).\n\nHowever, the route doesn't have a formalised start or end, so the bus drivers have to exit the \"carpark\", drive multiple rounds (up to three!) before terminating, to ensure that there is service across that gap. Anyone who understands bus bunching can tell you that having each trip be three rounds long will cause the buses to bunch up and the timings to be terribly irregular. The driver cannot guarantee that each of the three rounds will take the same time to complete! In contrast, at NUS where I'm based, the buses travel one round maximum and layover at a terminal that is along the route. So the departure times at the start of the route are always guaranteed to be regular - if a driver is fast and early, the break ensures he departs the terminal on time instead of too early, while if he is delayed along the way, he can speed up to reach, and subsequently depart, the terminal on time instead of late. Not to mention that if the drivers get more breaks, they'll have an easier life and hopefully drive safer.\n\nThe timings are also not coordinated, and appear to be based on when the drivers need to change shifts to drive for other contracts outside campus, so I've encountered the situation where I get \"kicked off\" the Blue at Saraca and the next three Blues are all terminating too. Would be far better if the Multi-round trips overlapped properly.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the management does not look at shuttle buses with the same seriousness as we do at NUS. I used to blame the choice of Tong Tar as an operator, as I generally don't have a good impression of them with their choice of off-brand Chinese buses (nothing against China but really? Step entrance Zhongtong Sunny?) and very cost-cutting 'chapalang' image, running with half the fleet being random coaches some of which bear advertisements for other shuttle services.\n\nBut I realised that RWS8, which is also contracted to Tong Tar, has a proper, exclusive, wheelchair-accessible fleet (also Zhongtong) bearing RWS advertisements and having working destination signage. In fact, the better buses in the current NTU shuttle bus fleet (Yutong) are hand-me-downs from the previous gen of RWS8! So with more investment, it's possible - Tong Tar evidently just doesn't see NTU as their most valued customer, I wonder why... (Meanwhile at Sentosa, ComfortDelGro Bus sends over buses that were used at NUS first...)\n\nI don't really know if all of this (the decision to invest more into internal shuttle) is within the control of Transport Admin or HAS or someone bigger, but I would encourage everyone to push ahead on these problems while being understanding of the constraints. I hope that one day when the constraints are overcome (like maybe there's an opportunity to construct or modify somewhere into a proper terminal) then a change will really be made to take advantage of that loss of constraint, and that change can only happen if students do think about these issues and voice them out. Don't give up guys!\n\n\\-The ISB Man of NUS"

Since university ranking does not look at teaching, it just gets ignored. Faculty members are also under the stress that the university tries to squeeze every bit of 'utility' out of them with an emphasis on research. In my view, this is unnecessary and not a sustainable way to retain the faculty members as it creates a vicious cycle: \n\npeople left -> higher cost to hire people (need to pay higher salary) -> more extraction from the new hires -> new hires left\n\nEdit: added the second part of the comment on education quality"

I\u2019m not sure if the administration even knows this or just assumes every student has to deal with data in their projects. Even in the template and guidelines they give us, it\u2019s obviously skewed to the sciences. Aim of study, methodology, results and impacts - these are not how a humanities paper is written. Even our profs (loveliest faculty members ever) are aware of this and are resigned to us having to skew our papers to fit ureca\u2019s requirement. Also, it\u2019s a known fact that it\u2019s much harder for humanities fac to get research grants/tenure, which is honestly a wasted opp because any one of us will tell you that our profs are really passionate and genuinely want the students to do well (which is why I was surprised when I heard about fac from other schools just plonking theory on their slides and reading off of it during lecture). Humanities profs are ones that really care about student wellbeing, they go out of their way to find us opportunities when they hear about our concerns, or if they know that a student needs help say, finding a job etc. I honestly find the lack of support for the humanities disappointing but I guess it\u2019s also the same in other countries where the arts and humanities are seen as non essential and disposable."

But the workplace has spread across to the tutorial rooms at Arc. Isn't NTU should be adhering to govt's direction with ongoing pandemic??\n\nNot only that! Govt also announced that the event that gathers masses together is banned. But NTU still continues to hold finals onsite with hundreds of students in the examination halls under the same ventilation system, which was the prime suspect of Covid outbreak at TTSH! None of us were vaccinated at that time. All they do was take student's temperature and issue them with the green sticker to \"verify\" that students are well. Wow, we didn't know that the green sticker will stop Covid. What a joke!"

I took an EEE machine learning module, but all we got from the prof was a big bunch of messy slides of pure theory, and he would simply read through them during lecture. And the prof uploaded his slides (about 50-100 slides per chapter), in a format where we couldn\u2019t use Ctrl-F function (????). I have no idea why that restriction was there in the first place. I had to email in to request for the slides to be uploaded in a Ctrl-F-able format. The worst part was that the quizzes and final exam were based on memorising content. There was no coding involved in the entire module.\n\nI took an MS module that was based on pure memorisation as well. The worst part was that there were past year papers available in the printing shop. All we had to do was memorise the answer keys because there was a very obvious pattern of repeated questions throughout the years. I learnt nothing from this module. \n\nBack in NUS, all of my exams for my engineering modules at least included a one A4 sized cheatsheet. The exams consisted of application questions instead of definition questions.\n\nI spoke with other people that took these NTU modules with me, and all agreed that they sucked.\n\nApparently this is the norm for engineering students (memorising content for assessments)? Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nThis method of teaching feels very traditional and backward."

My uncle who also studied in NTU in the early 90s, was horrified when I told him my experiance, and lamented how NTU back in the 90s, was essentially a teaching university which was student-centric. \n\nDuring my time in NTU, there had been several complains about Lecturers with very poor command of English, who walks into every lecture, either disinterested or are bad in their command of language. The joke back than was how you are better of learning from Khan Academy and YouTube, than to actually attend lectures.\n\nI realised how true that was when in Year 2, I realised that all of my lecturers (esp those from India or China), were using TEMPLATE LECTURE SLIDES. These are basically slides that has been prepared by the publishers of the Textbook, which the lecturer than prescribes in their textbook list for the course. \n\nNow, I have had some awesome lecturers, who use these slides for visuals only. I have had lecturers who make their own slides, with some using self-written OHP slides.\n\nBut the majority of Engineering Lecturers, put in as little to no effort, by using these template slides provided by textbook publishers, and reading off the slides every time. \n\nMany of the issues that NTU is facing now, started appearing from Su Guaning's time, and continued on during Bertil Anderson. The whole notion of how NTU is a teaching university changed somewhere from 2005 onwards, with relentless prioritisation given to research and making teaching duties an add-on responsibility. Nothing wrong with that. But for a self-proclaiming World Class University, that aspires to attract Undergrads, they need to put much more effort to anchoring back NTU into a student-centric University."

The Hive starts from level B5 to level 3, 8 floors in total, and has 3 lifts servicing the whole building. There's a few entrance points for the Hive but most common is the one at B4 and B5. However, I've come across various times where lessons are held on level 2 or level 3, which is at the very top, but when you enter the building from level B4 or B5 and attempt to take the lifts you instead end up taking the stairs. The lifts are ancient and move very slow. Whenever we attempt to take the lifts, they are either full or move very slowly, which is why it would be faster to just take the stairs. My friends and I have concluded that NTU only invested into the design of the building and not the lifts. Before anyone says strawberry or entitled, think \"Would you want to go climbing 6-8 flights of stairs for your lessons while carrying your bags and laptop, especially when most often your rushing to your next lesson in Hive from another building.\""

Online classes have proved to be rather effective (and personally, better than physical ones), so why are they risking our health and lives for physical classes? Either way we are paying the school fees yeah? As a school, shouldn\u2019t it prioritize the students\u2019 lives? What\u2019s the point of the govt saying 5 pax for social gatherings outside when there are so many of us crammed in a LT? NTU is managing this pandemic situation so horribly it ain\u2019t even funny. If you house so many students, it makes sense to prevent clusters from being created in your institution, not help create more. Smh"

You reply back to clarify again and it bounces back n forth multiple times n they only paste the EXACT SAME explanation all 5 times expecting it to have responded fully to your question.

Most decisions do not come from Managerial level but at the Academic positions level and administration head of each school, or the centralised office. Some of the Profs are known to not want to teach and we always had problem with giving them teaching load. They are more concern in doing research anyway. The management was terribly bad at handling and reacting fast in Mar/April last year that staff had to come to work everyday despite the govt informing of WFH arrangements. The solution to them was to segregate the office and separate each team but we were still seeing each other for meetings in the same building. It really depends how good each of the schools' leadership were and that their policies differs. Some staff were made to work alternate days but others were made to come everyday. The lack of quality and empathetic leaders, and the outdated mindset of staff who have been too long in the company and refuse to make catalytic changes, along with elite circle of Profs in their own clique, are some of the reasons why the administration has failed in some ways and it translates to an unpleasant experience for all."

Yes but for public nia, not for the students.

                "comment": "Just found this thread. I agree with all of the mentioned points by OP.  and I wanna share my share of the story. \n\nMy background: An international student that had just graduated from SCBE.\n\nI went to an overseas internship in Jan 2020 in China. When the pandemic happened, my batch was asked (ordered) by the program officer to come back to Singapore else the internship will not be credited. I am an international student (the only international student in that batch of China internship program) and I do not have another home here in SG. A week before I came back (i.e., right after we are ordered), I wrote an email to HAS if I could have a hostel to stay in once I reached Singapore. No reply from HAS, and the program officer said she will check with HAS. I have sent few emails to HAS before the departure date from China. Till the departure day, I received no response from HAS. I was anxious as it was quite hard to even rent a room outside of NTU at that time. I came back on the 1st of February and the pandemic was not as serious as in March. Hence, I was not issued with a SHN. Even though I was not issued with a SHN, I went straight to the quarantine facilities in NTU (Graduate Hall 1, GH1) as I had no place to go. Within the two weeks stay in GH1, I emailed (no reply) and phone called HAS (The officer said she will see what she can do) numerous times. The 2 weeks stay came to an end and HAS had yet to get back to me. I asked the quarantine officer if I could stay a few more days in GH1 until HAS get back to me and the answer is no. I was left with no choice but to rent a place outside at a shady HDB (The owner did not register me at HDB and the unit itself is compartmentalized into 8 rooms) (I did not know that the owner had to register me at that time). However, I am still glad that someone agreed to rent me a place considered that I just came back from China. The best part was after I moved out from GH1, the quarantine facilities officer called me, saying that I have a bill for quarantining myself at GH1 (S$530++). The room at GH1 was great but the food supplied was terrible (sometimes with uncooked chicken). I did not complain during my stay in GH1 as I thought the stay was free. I raised this issue to NTU management and I just got a reply saying that he will look into this matter. :/\n\nThis was a very bad experience of mine with NTU (especially HAS).\n\nHowever, my school's management (and lecturers) are decent. The overseas program officer has no plan or suggestion at all on what's next for students like me but SCBE's course coordinator responded quickly and advised me on what I could do next. CAO also helped me a lot at securing a local internship. (If I am not mistaken, Ms. Ho was the person who handled my case, thanks Ms. Ho).\n\nOverall, I have close to zero issues with SCBE's lecturers as they are often helpful to the students. They take student's suggestions into considerations for their teachings and decisions. Most of them are very happy to offer extra hours to help students with their assignments and projects.\n\nOf course, there are still some mods that gave me bad experience (Unorganized notes and bad teaching, i.e., lecturer reading 1-to-1 whatever is written on notes w/o further explanation). My worst memory was a mod (Engineering Math) from a lecturer from SPMS. His accent is so bad that I gave up attending his class at all after the first lesson and studied entirely myself from the Internet. To be fair, I don't completely put the blame on the lecturer as he was trying his best too (but still...). These issues are still manageable for me (as I know where to search for the study materials) but I don't think my peers are happy with those lecturers.\n\nThese are the things that came to my mind for now. Will add on if I remember anything else.\n\nSorry for the bad English :X."

NTU does suffer in some aspects but much better than NUS in my overall experience.\n\nI had to switch schools because I was in engineering and I wanted to do psychology. I can tell you that ntu is a lot more caring towards its students than NUS. What makes me say that?\n\n1) Ntu Dean and head of department cares more than NUS. When I wanted to transfer course, I got rejected twice. Later I found out from my student advisor that it was for \"KPI reasons\". My only other option was to go to ntu. Not only that, I had to take leave of absence for health reasons. Not once in my nus course did I hear anything from the Dean or professors. In ntu they actually arranged a meeting with me to see how else they can support me and assist me in returning to my studies \n\n2) Ntu cares more for mental well-being than NUS (I can't say for physical because both wait times are abyssmal). I got an appointment much faster and they actually called to see which counsellor was best fit to my situation. Nus just sent me a last minute email expecting me to turn up in 1 hour.\n\n3) professors care more about you in ntu. In NUS, profs were often \"I didn't teach this segment you go find the dipstick who did\". Granted this wasn't their job but ntu profs were still willing to go through even though they taught different segments of the course. \n\n4) The admin staff were also more supportive overall. Email responses to staff (and profs) didn't take three working days.\n\n5) Internship ntu staff were also amazing. I got a no-allowance internship on my own and so there was no need to support me. But they found a scheme which allowed me to get some allowance in the end.\n\nOf course they aren't perfect. Before my transfer I had to submit some documents. But due to my leave of absences I didn't have (nor do I need) certain documents.\n\n1) the admin staff in charge of admissions kept asking me for said documents (6-7 times) and I kept responding if it's needed since I didn't have it. He said he would check before getting back to me. He didn't. And he asked for it AGAIN. \n\nGranted I know these are my experiences, but I just want to highlight that I personally find NTU felt much more amazing than my experiences in NUS."

They can conveniently hide behind the bureaucratic SOP. They don\u2019t have incentives to do better. They just have to focus on international ranking by churning out papers and complying with the marking scheme, which are what we are good at.\n\nOn top of this, a lack of pressure from the student body traditionally and historically totally has totally spoilt this bunch of technocrats. Looking at University overseas, the administration commonly face pressure from student union. But this is obviously not a thing here."

Harlow wtf? \n\nEven for my own school when I had to settle my modules and find missing item, I had to call multiple times over a few hours before I get to them. \n\nAnd part of the tuition fee goes to upkeeping campus facilities that I had never used.\n\nI really dunno what's the purpose of these people.

I remember one semester apparently one dept had a mass exodus of admin staff and the lower ranked people left behind were swamped with all the student enquiries while the higher ranked ones (usually also the same people who will be there for many years) are just behind the scenes doing idk what la. I remember distinctly because me and my friends were trying to secure a tutorial slot but there was only one guy handling everything, poor thing. And apparently it's still happening.\n\nBut our local unis bleeding academics is nothing new. There's always so much pressure from the institution to churn out publications and improve the uni's rankings and get the most cost/ranking/teaching benefits out from the acads they all leave. And the students just suffer because the upper management of the unis don't bother to look at the reasons why the acads are leaving."

Then reapply during next year's cycle with your A Levels/Poly GPA.\n\nI've tried transferring from NTU to NUS (unsuccessfully) and from what the office told me the spaces are really limited. Your uni GPA has to be >4.50 to even get a chance of transferring.  Not sure if it's as competitive for SMU.\n\nThen again, you must have chosen NTU for a reason. You also have to justify why you dropped out of NTU - my advice, say you wanted to do a gap year to do internships. Your decision, just my 2 cents."

Maybe at least some things will be addressed.\n\nAlso, if you're already stuck with it, you can do your best to make the most of it, and I'm sure you can still come out strong and well-prepared for the world. As some other students have shared, there are good professors, so try to figure out who those are when choosing your classes. Knowing the problems with the system beforehand means you can be prepared and not be blindsided by them.\n\nIf eventually, you can become a voice for change, and one of a growing portion of the student body working together to make things better for yourselves, whether through your own initiatives, or by getting the administration to make changes, whether by negative or positive pressure, then that's also a good thing, and good practice for life.\n\nBut most important is your own education. Make sure you know what you want to have achieved by the time you graduate, and find the best ways to get there using what the school, and being in the school, makes available to you. Sometimes the most valuable things come not from the school itself, but from being with your fellow students or the other opportunities that become possible."

While I can't comment on the quality there, I know I had a good experience with the professors. \n\nI was from NBS, and while there are some middling professors, none were clearly bad, and there was a good amount of them who were *clearly* and overwhelmingly brilliant. I had a professor for business valuation that dissected abstract accounting and valuation concepts into bite-sized pieces and it was glorious.\n\nI know it sucks reading this right before matriculation.

I'm positive LTA can plan more buses that run from various parts of Singapore into NTU. It still serves the public because they can use the stations in between. Of course it means longer transit time than the direct shuttle bus but sitting on a bus ride throughout is convenient and a preferred option for some. We have more buses running to JB from various points around the island but pulau NTU? There's only 179/199 which you MUST take from boon lay."

And it doesn't even look like they're rolling the red carpet out for that.\n\nAsking LTA to \"take over\" the heartland shuttles by providing extra routes to NTU might work, but you're just shifting that burden to the North Spine/Sch of BioSci bus stops or something, which may be difficult to improve with JRL construction work in the area. \n\nAnd with the expressways being the only approach to NTU, the public benefit part is reduced since there's going to be significant mileage just for NTU students - again, unless they build a proper bus interchange facility for the public in addition to NTU students.\n\nAt the end of the day, the university has to give a damn. Peaceful coexistence is not impossible as proven by KR Terminal...\n\n> Tong Tar evidently just doesn't see NTU as their most valued customer.\n\nIt's also up to NTU to set service standards for Tong Tar to meet. LTA and NUS (the latter in part thanks to you) impose, and enforce, them."

For some of the core engineering modules, I can even use lecture notes and tutorials from year 2010.\n\nThe pedagogy is also extremely worthless. It encourages students to cram theories and spam tutorials to pass exams. Because most modules don't allow cheatsheet at all, we're forced to memorize formulas needlessly. \n\nThe practical component of the modules is either nonexistent or insignificant, so we end up producing engineering graduates who can't use oscilloscopes, write code or use solder. It's just a token inclusion into our curriculum so NTU can show that their curriculum is holistic.\n\nI've looked through the NUS curriculum and I still regret not choosing NUS instead. Even though EE may not be the forte of NUS, their modules are so modern and interesting.\n\nAnd don't get me started on how bad the social environment is. EEE is a dumping ground due to low entry requirement, and it's reflected in the students' attitude towards academics. For example, I've had a group mate who started to work on their part of class presentation at 7 am when the class was at 10 am, because she went drinking with her hall friends overnight. The majority are just here to cruise through life, so it's also extremely difficult to find people who want to go above and beyond their curriculum and partake in events like hackathons."

The S/U tool is meant to be used to allow people to take modules that they might be interested in, but not confident of doing well. Allowing them to take the module without fear of dropping their GPA. Also, it can be used for people looking to just put minimal effort into a module due to heavy core workload. You can also use it as a gambling tool, but that\u2019s up to us. \n\nThe S/U issue has been brought up many times by many students.

I have many engineering friends and all of them have the same sentiment about the quality of education - it\u2019s not good.\n\nYes it's a small sample size, but if I had the means to make a survey and send it to all NTU undergraduates, I would do so.\n\n**EDIT: And it's really interesting how you claim that there are no complaints about the quality of education over at CS (amongst your peers) when your post -** [**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/m7jzro/prospectivecurrent_scse_students_please_read/) **clearly states that a good proportion of former and current students are lambasting your school for outdated curriculum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How many percent of students agree that there was a lack of crowd management? I'm guessing it's just a small minority.\n\nI'm guessing you weren't on campus last year during semester 1? The whole of Singapore was on high alert and the streets/malls were virtually empty. But on campus, it was business as usual, with students being forced to attend online lectures at common areas, food establishments were as crowded as before COVID times and bus stops were overflowing with students."

And they are all aspects of consideration when deciding to enrol in a university. \n\nFor example, with regards to the teaching materials and explanations, it can really make a difference of you spending numerous hours to have a basic grasp of the material or spending just a few which actually that takes away from your own work-life balance. And if the lecture has not done its job of adding enough value, why is there even a lecture at all.\n\nPersonally, I was lucky enough to be able to select most courses in all 3 local unis, but I also just want to get my degree over and done with. And the things OP mentioned would actually be key considerations when deciding to enter into a university. All these aspects actually incur the cost of inconvenience and actual stress that could be better managed if more attention was paid towards it. \n\nI think the issue is not \"can we endure this problem\" but \"why this problem actually exists in the first place, if we have the capability to resolve it\". If you were starting a school from scratch, would this be an ideal for you? Would you plaster this right on your billboard?"

(If I was, I'd say to relocate these animals, etc) Wildlife on campus is fairly commonplace and understandable given the location of the school. However I do think that residents' (especially the children in the executive buildings nearby) safety should be prioritised within the already-developed areas.\n\nIn the past 6 months, there has been little effort by administration to discourage monkeys from entering student rooms or encouraging them to return to the forest. If anything, this may lead to the monkeys bringing in other monkeys for easy pickings of food in our urban areas.\n\nIt doesn't help that in most cases, the safest outcome for a person encountering these animals would be to drop their plastic bags if they start attacking/harassing/threatening them, leading to these animals getting conditioned to the notion that \"if I harass the hoomans, I get food\"."

But that\u2019s not the problem. Plenty of major roads are also one lane in each direction. The problem is that the buses DONT PULL INTO A DEDICATED BAY. Notice how along busy roads, buses change lanes into the bus stop and merge out onto the main road again?? Not at NTU! If you have a bus stopped (or multiple buses stopped), the WHOLE ROAD COMES TO A COMPLETE STANDSTILL \ud83e\udd72\n\nThis has forced so many road users to do a blind overtake just so we don\u2019t end up waiting behind a queue of 4 buses and creating a traffic jam. \n\nI want more buses too. I\u2019d skip private transport and use buses to commute to NTU given the option. But the road infrastructure there is so stupid that I\u2019m now having road rage just thinking of it.

I have waited and seen others waiting for TWO HOURS in vain on weekends because there was nothing except the 199 which came only every 30 minutes. You can only use 199 so much.\n\nFrom around 11 to 26 June, none of the NTU bus apps showed the position of a single red or blue bus on the map or in the list of upcoming buses. It is very likely that the bus uncles simply switch off their GPS. Only last week was this rectified. Still, the problem lies with the bus operators for neither providing frequent service nor giving an estimate of when the next bus will arrive."

I'm not sure how things would work with JRL and its three stops, instinct tells me it may relieve demand on CR, but no student staying on campus is going to make a 1-stop JRL journey part of their daily commute."

My understanding of the US most universities is that they live on (1) donations (2) tuition fees (esp. from the foreign students) and (3) overhead of the research grants professors earned (the norm is 50%). Items (1) is kind of most important, together with the help of (2), is substantial to daily infrastructure maintenance and construction work and (3) is most given back as scholarships to students. I do not know how it works in Singapore. It seems very different from how the US universities are run as Singapore universities are subject to heavy administration from MOE and item (1) is almost nonexistent."

It\u2019s true that we are replaceable in a sense, but if eventually majority of the \u201cbetter\u201d students see through this nonsense and decide to go other uni instead, wouldn\u2019t the standard of the uni drop? Yes the spots will still be filled by other students, but the standard of the school will be compromised no? Or do the uni just not care?"

The \"top professors\" part is subjective but personally I think the professors' quality and profile have varied widely. I have had couple of professors who are just bachelor degree holders, don't get me wrong they can be great but I don't imagine they have much bargaining power in their salary. Overall I just didn't observe anything that actually justifies the extra price tag."

But really, as I have seen your past activism and posts about how \"poor NTU provides for a proper education\" here before, posting on Reddit and complaining about them isn't going to bring any action to upper management other than spreading more awareness to the wider public (who I believe, are also not in a capacity to reform the school system as ex- or non-NTU students).

The wording they used in emails as in 'exception' made absolutely no sense, like they are implying it is not a right but a privilege that these students are not forcibly evicted within 14 days. Is housing not a basic need? How tone deaf can the administration be? Yes, I get that hostels, to a certain extent, are a privilege but this is more nuanced than that. It came with a promise and a responsibility for taking care of our students yet they fail to note that part.\n\nIt is even more ironic that they caused this big fiasco in the name of covid and fulfilling the 2-year guarantee for freshmen. Nothing wrong with using halls as a marketing tool, but something is definitely off when you're sacrificing your current students / breaking other promises just to keep their own promise to someone else. It's telling that NTU is more interested in raking in students than helping their own current students."

Unionizing workers works because workers can collectively stop working and grind the firm to a halt in days. Students can do what?

This means the degree you are getting will be held in higher regard all around the world.\n\nPassionate about shuttle bus, food and other issues affecting the student body?

But nowadays universities (esp in Singapore) are for people to \"secure\" a job. For example people are enrolling in Computer Science to become a software developer, and not because they want to research or study more about the theoretical aspects. Maybe it's better if we somehow can separate learning a technical skill vs learning to do research in universities. This way we could have profs (or teachers) that are focused on education and researching separately, rather than giving them both responsibilities"

But they won't like here. They would come here for a few years, spend all the research money given to them and then left. What I find disappointing is that the NTU (and NUS to some extent) does not have a will to retain people, which would incur a higher cost to the university.

Again as a student or employee, I am inclined to interpret it as better management -- I was there for a year and it was truly different, even very different from the public universities.

While we do have partners who do rent out for 1 day weekends, they do have some hefty requirements (eg. age)\nCarousell might be an alternative, though last heard was that Carousell had removed listings of car rentals because it was not a product to be sold per se.\nLet us know if you've got more questions, be happy to help shed light or help. \n\nPS: If you don't mind taking over the weekend or are still keen on renting, feel free to PM us, we'll hook you up with a welcome discount."

If you return it without a full tank, you get billed for the cost of fuel above market rates. This is typical for most of the big rental companies at airports.\n\n(2) You take the car with whatever is in the tank and return it above 1/4 tank. The fuel is included in the rental, and you instead have a maximum mileage per day. This is common for small, hourly rentals where you may not deal with an employee. \n\nHaving a policy where you would return the car above the reserve indicator but pay for it out of pocket seems really inconvenient. I suspect they are taking advantage of the breakage where people return substantially above the requirement. This cannot happen in the two schemes I've listed above."

Shit's illegal, dangerous and completely irresponsible.\n\nNow if you do want to track some cars with your friends, you can go to Pasir Gudang in JB and rent some of their track cars. This is probably the cheapest track option if your friends don't have their own cars here. They're mostly stripped out Protons modified for the track. They're a blast to drive, but they're no supercars obviously. The track is also quite unforgiving because it's a technical motorcycle track and there is little run off. I believe they have open track days every Saturday and Sunday, but you may want to book the cars in advance if your group's big. This is their website: http://www.johorcircuit.com.my/\n\nYou can also rent better cars to use at Sepang International Circuit. It'll cost more, but this is the much better option. It's a much bigger track, is far more forgiving and has lots of facilities. I've never rented any cars myself so I recommend any one rental company over another but here's a few: \n\nhttp://www.n1racing.net/ \n\nhttp://www.keganiracing.com/page/news-items/kegani-race-car-rentals1.aspx\n\nThis forum might help as well: http://www.zerotohundred.com/newforums/sepang-circuit/\n\nNow if you want to street race in Malaysia, I still wouldn't recommend it. I don't condone racing on public roads. You can however, pay the cops to close some back roads for you. The speed limits in Malaysia are also not very strongly enforced.\n"

Lodging, air travel etc is covered, and you can claim for food everyday.\n\n- Every year (pre Covid ofc), we get flown to US for a week for company conference. Lodging, air travel etc is covered, and you can claim for food everyday. I also extended my trip once, and went to Japan after the conference; no need to pay for the tickets LOL (everything else I have to pay la ofc)\n\n- Pantry is top tier. Some snacks that I can remember that the pantry have: Ruffles, Lays, Pocky, Hello Panda, Pokka Green Tea, Coke, Sparkling Water, Magnum Ice Cream, CP frozen meals\n\n- Every last working day of the month will have caterer come in for breakfast \n\n- Every last 3 days of quarter end will have catering food for lunch, last 2 days breakfast caterer also. We once brought in Springleaf prata to cook prata for us onsite. Stink up the entire office in grease smell but so worth it LOL\n\n- On and off will get US$125 for team bonding activities per person. But since covid we can't do that, so $125 is all for food. \n\n- Annual leave is ~20 days per year, but can only carry forward 10. So now I'm stuck with 30 days of PTO that IDK how to clear\n\n- Get free company phone (iPhone 11 or Samsung S20) with paid plan. I mainly use it as 2FA for my VPN LOL\n\n- Got one-off budget when we switched to WFH, didn't need much so I bought Secretlab Titan essentially free\n\n- Not applicable to me, and I think its JP-specific, but my team mate in JP got a 1 year maternity leave"

I didn't use it personally, but several of our departments had yearly bumper crop of babies. We could also claim for all kinds of health and medical related expenses including body wash... random.\n\nMy current corporate health insurance comes with flexidollars to top up insurance to higher coverage, or claim for health, fitness or holiday costs. I claimed $400 for my yoga package this year.\n\nI'm in a mostlydeskbound job but absolutely lucky to have management who does not care if you appear online or not, as long as the job gets done. We are encouraged to take time off during the work day to exercise or run errands. I have 24 days of annual leave.\n\nOne thing i hope to see more employers do is include mental health claims in their corporate health insurance. I plan on raising this up to our HR as they are big on mental health awareness but it's still in the exclusion clause.\n\nEdit: all above are MNC. Caveat that some benefits are very role dependent, which is why i didn't mention them. The annual leave, medical package etc are standard benefits that you get to ask about before you sign the contract. It is your right, and will not make you appear greedy or competitive as this is all about your full compensation for labour. Other role dependent benefits you might see in sales, consultancy, etc are transport allowance, entertainment expenses, mobile claim, and incentive trips before covid19 :("

Same as above, if you're not feeling well just make sure your team/manager knows your taking the day off. No MC required.\n* Flexible working hours, depending on your job scope/manager. If you worked overtime the previous day, feel free to start the next day later.\n* Managers encouraged employees to plan for and take day offs. It's not common for people to take two weeks off in one go.\n* Free access to online learning platforms like LinkedIn Learning, O'Reilly Books (web version), etc.\n* Education/Certification reimbursement (incl. MBA programs).\n* Annual medical check-up.\n* Great culture: Employees are encouraged to join different engagement teams with support from leadership. Allows employees to propose new ideas or influence policy to management. Gives employees more ownership of the workplace.\n* Before COVID-19, free breakfast every Friday."

Seniors and managers very helpful and were always there for us if we had any questions and difficulties. \n\nBoss didn't micromanage, only cared about whether the job was done at the end of the day. Free lunch provided too. \n\nGo home at 5.30 sharp everyday, and Fridays at 5pm. No OT! No one disturbs you after you go home. Loved that place place much that I told HR I wanted to do my 1 year internship placement there and I'm going back in a few weeks. Excited!"

Means whatever you can think of they have. Ice cream, healthy drinks, cereals, etc. They too have meals covered (Lunch) and i think upwards of 20 ALs. Google has in-house pods to sleep in and you can book the massage rooms for massages. These are just some perks. Most tech firms would not require MC to be submitted and allows OOO if some urgent comes around (i.e. child is sick, contractor coming, etc). Most of these tech firms have insurance/medical/dental for all their employees (+spouse) without co-pay and they some have flexibenefits on top of that for gym membership, yoga, etc.  \n\nMost SMEs will definitely lack in these areas. SMEs have co-pay to DETER people from taking medical leaves, and not for cost saving tbh. If anyone is complaining please note that MOM standard is 7 days of AL, which A LOT of SMEs adhere to. Pantry does not exits, and it is just a space for you to eat your food. You might find water if you are lucky. There will always be a company with better benefits, and there will always be a company who will have the bare minimum (MOM requirements) to function for maximum profits."

I can say this is rather rare.\n\nHaving said that, I've heard of a email practice at Daimler - emails sent to employees on leave are automatically deleted. The sender will get to choose instead to acknowledge that their email will be deleted, or email someone else if it's an emergency, or email the said employee again when they are back from their leave. Pretty good scheme, but sadly it works bases on an employee's opt-in. Which brings us back to the culture of the company once again.\n\nAlso heard of a good initiative by AWARE to their employees, if you send an email out of office hours or on weekends the boss will email the sender and tell them not to do so. Not sure if every dept is like that but the dept I know does this. (Source: friend who works there)\n\nSG bosses could really take a leave out of Daimler's book for a start on email (and WHATSAPP) communication practices especially if the boss is the kind that likes to work remote (because he can)"

I've had good and bad bosses of many different nationalities and in general, the firm's culture tends to have a much large impact than the nationality of the bosses himself/herself. A bad boss in a place with a good culture is likely to get ousted very quickly. A very good boss in a bad place would often be under pressure to change their ways unless they can deliver outstanding results, even then, these bosses tend to get worn down over time, and usually end up adopting the prevailing culture at the firm."

Since both of us weren't able to travel back to SG, I ended up spending 9 months in Malaysia.\n\nFull salary and I worked from Malaysia. No questions asked. Infact, when we came back to Singapore last year November, they covered all of my hotel and SHN expenses. Including the food bills.\n\nStuff like that makes me really grateful to be working for my company still."

Another secret to appearing like a subject matter expert is to ask the client what is their interpretation of the subject matter? \n\nA consultant can get the client to explain to them what does the client think this all means. And whilst the client explains, the consultant is actually gathering much needed knowledge and background info from their explanation. Then it's just a matter of plugging in from previous work experience and applying what they learnt from other successful projects into this one.\n\nOther things that can help them improve their image as a consultant includes doing mental maths on the fly, talking and speaking confidently.

                "comment": "Some things to consider, even though you can legally drive without being named in the insurance details.\n\n>A named driver is someone who can drive the car with the owner's permission and be covered by car insurance with the same privileges as the owner. It is common for car owners to include other names in their car insurance plan, especially if it's their partners or family members.\n\n>Nonetheless, in a scenario whereby an unnamed driver gets into an accident, the car insurance company is entitled to impose a higher excess on the claim. For example, if the insurance excess of your policy is $500, and you allow an unnamed driver to drive your car, who subsequently gets into an accident, the insurance company may demand you to pay more than the current $500 excess on the claim. On the other hand, if the driver is a named driver on your policy, and he or she gets into an accident, the excess stays at $500.\n\n>However, the one drawback that multiple named drivers on a policy have is the extra cost. This is due to the fact that the more named drivers you have, the more chance there will be to have an accident. This is especially true if you include many inexperienced drivers on your policy. The fact that they are inexperienced drivers alone increases the risk for the insurance company.\n\n>Thus, it is important to ensure that you include regular users of your car as named drivers in your policy.\n\n[Source](http://www.sgcarmart.com/news/writeup.php?AID=112)"

As long as Third Party risk is not mitigated for a particular vehicle + operator combination, it is a no go, except for the exclusions in Section 7."

I recall I was once stuck in a field in the middle no where for half a day because I took the wrong train in Japan. I gotten a mini culture shock when I realise there are significant stretches of the London tube where you can't use internet at all.\n\n\u2022 Hawker centres, good price and huge varieties of food under one roof.\n\n**Cons**\n\n\u2022 The humidity, coming out of shower or sweating under the sun in 80 to 90% humidity is not a pleasant experience.\n\n\u2022 People here can be so square. But I don't really blame them since we all brought up in hyper practical mindset.\n\n\u2022 The work life balance feels bad at times. Somehow some companies assume more hours = more work. I dislike occasionally when short working hours or 4 days workdays are brought, some out of touch experts are brought in how this will affect our  productivity and competitiveness and shut down any such arguments."

Need to be UL2272 certified for eskate and for FPV only can fly outside nfz which is way out for me if not I have to take permits. No fun tbh. I almost bought a Bajaboard which is close to $4000 then they roll out UL2272 if not LTA will fine and confiscate the machine. Drone wise it was fine before, then all the new rules started making it difficult to even fly under 250g in nfz. So abandoned those two hobbies. Spent close to about 7k or more in total.\n\nSo these days just back to my old hobby which is photography but moved to a new genre. Been exploring boudoir and so on. Still doing medium format but it get me out a lot like skating. Oh well.\n\nOther than that not much issue with Singapore, if into space cakes Vietnam isn't a bad place for some fresh ones. Teehee"

                "comment": "For those too lazy to get past the paywall:\n\n\n>Rental firms stepping up checks as their vehicles are being hired to smuggle contraband cigarettes and drugs\nZaihan Mohamed Yusof\n\n\nRental companies said they are increasingly concerned that some of their cars are being hired for criminal activities. Not only are the cars impounded during investigation, but some are also damaged during an arrest.\n\n>Between 2014 and last year, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) detained more than 70 rental vehicles for investigations.\n\n>The latest case involving a rental car was on Jan 13, when police chased a Honda Fit for 5km before the driver and passenger were arrested for a drug-related offence.\n\n>Those in the car rental trade said the problem is fairly common.\n\n>Mr Elvin Ang, 32, a co-director of Elitez Car Rental, said: \"I've seen more than 30 cases in the last five years. Most were drug-related.\"\n\n>The car involved in the Jan 13 incident is from his company, which is located in MacPherson Road.\n\n>The Straits Times spoke to 15 such firms, which rent out everything from hatchbacks to luxury sedans. Nine of the companies said their cars had been used to smuggle contraband cigarettes and drugs.\n\n>The companies usually find out when they get a call from law enforcement agencies.\n\n>Mr Frankie Chan of Dream Car Leasing in Kaki Bukit said that in a year, at least \"three to four\" of his cars are impounded by the authorities in drug-related probes.\n\n>Said Mr Chan, 41, whose company has a fleet of 70 cars: \"When the hirer is arrested or goes missing, who's going to pay us? I still have to pay the car's monthly instalments.\"\n\n>Police said that in \"more than 80 evasion cases\" during checks between January 2014 and December 2015, about 19 per cent involved rental vehicles.\n\n>CNB said that of the 289 vehicles detained for investigations between 2014 and last year, 25 per cent of them involved rental vehicles.\n\n>However, Singapore Customs said rental vehicles are \"not commonly used\" in the smuggling of contraband cigarettes. A spokesman said: \"Vehicles seized by Singapore Customs, which were subsequently ordered to be forfeited by the court, were used mostly for conveying, delivering and storing of duty-unpaid cigarettes.\"\n\n>The spokesman did not say how many involved rental vehicles.\n\n>Mr Peter Cheong, president of the Vehicle Rental Association (VRA), said it is unclear if this is a widespread problem. There are about 200 vehicle rental firms, but only about 30 are VRA members.\n\n>Mr Cheong, who has written \"four to five\" appeal letters to the authorities to release impounded cars, said: \"There are a lot of unreported cases. If members don't officially approach us, we will not be able to help them.\"\n\n>Criminals target rental cars because it would be harder to trace the perpetrators of a crime, especially when fake or stolen identification is used, he added.\n\n>The VRA recommends that members do not accept cash-only payments. Mr Cheong said: \"Most of the criminals don't use credit cards. They rent the car for a few days and pay by cash. Once we get a cash-only customer, alarms bells should be ringing.\"\n\n>Most of the rental firms said they are already vigilant.\n\n>If a potential hirer's identification documents, including identity card, driver's licence and credit card, do not match, Eazi Car Leasing will not rent out any of its fleet of 100 cars. The cars are equipped with Global Positioning System trackers and immobilisers.\n\n>Eazi's operations manager Yolanda Yang said it uses tracking software to monitor a rental car's location, especially when it encounters hirers who act suspiciously. They include potential hirers who provide identity card photos that do not match their faces.\n\n>Ms Yang said: \"Hirers who act suspiciously don't seem to sleep. They are never at home and move about in the middle of the night.\"\n\n>But even with diligence, her firm's cars have been involved in over 10 criminal cases in the last five years, including vice- related activities.\n\n>Mr Chan said there is an industry blacklist and his company checks a potential hirer's personal details against the list.\n\n>Sometimes, a \"reconnaissance team\" is sent to check who is really behind the wheel of a rental car.\n\n>Mr Chan said: \"We also know if hirers park their cars overnight at a few hot spots in Sin Ming and Ubi. We will then assume the cars are at workshops there for repairs.\"\n\n>A hirer has to pay a penalty of between $1,500 and $2,000 for breach of contract if he allows an undeclared person to drive the rental car, or if the car is driven into Malaysia without prior approval.\n\n>Rental companies said it is bad news when one of their cars is seized in an investigation. Once impounded, it may take weeks, or even months, before the vehicle is released, said Ms Yang. It costs her company about $100 in lost revenue a day when a car is impounded.\n\n>But there is even worse news than that.\n\n>Last August, one of Dream Car Leasing's cars - a Honda Jazz - was involved in an apparent drug-related collision.\n\n>The driver was arrested after he fell unconscious in his seat.\n\n>Mr Chan added: \"It was a total loss. I didn't repair the car as it had only a few months left (on its certificate of entitlement). I lost at least $10,000.\"  "

                "comment": "American living in Singapore. Lived in NYC and DC both previously. \n\nMost others have covered off things but I'd definitely recommend both getting an accountant and a realtor when coming here. The accountant to handle your US taxes, SG is easy, and the realtor to help you with landlords. Much like NYC, some landlords try to sneak in really shady clauses or blame you for things and ask you to pay up. Oh sqft often includes PES or private exterior space aka balcony. So watch that when looking at places. \n\nCompared to DC rent is going to be sky high, comparable to NYC but everything is a lot nicer to live in. You do not need a car. At all. Public transport is phenomenal and in fact mind blowing compared to NYC. \n\nYou don't have to live close to downtown to have a reasonable commute. Trains run what seems like every 2 minutes compared to NYCs 6+ minutes prime commute. Oh and they don't break down constantly. The only downside is they don't always run and close up kinda early so get Grab(Uber). \n\nFood can be anywhere from a couple bucks to hundreds depending on what you want but hawker food is amazing and cheap so I highly recommend it. \n\nAlcohol is insanely expensive, just how it is. Worse than NYC. \n\nPeople are really nice in general but don't be surprised if it's a little tough to make friends outside of work. It's like that in all big cities though. \n\nYour pay will be fine but you can tell they're banking on the overseas aspect of living selling it to you. TBH all big expat packages are a thing of the past but you'll do just fine on that wage. \n\nOne thing to remember is being an American your retirement options are limited because most financial advisors don't want to get involved. If you bank at Citi you might have an easier time since they have branches here. Otherwise go for a broker and handle your own investments. \n\nAlso the US embassy doesn't take DBS credit cards. I have no idea why lol. So being a spare or cash. \n\nFor me, I had an even salary swap considering exchange rates and it was the best move I ever made. I love it here though above is just my experiences and yours may be different. Any questions send me a message."

                "comment": "Regarding the taxes... it's the first thing people mention an American asks this kind of question, but people misunderstand it. You'll be double taxed! You'll pay the difference to the US, so you're not saving anything! No, you will save a lot in taxes. You aren't just paying the same as in the US.\n\nIn 2021, the limit of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is US$108.7k. In addition, you are entitled to your standard deduction, which is $12.5k. So already, you have US$121,200 in income not taxed by the US, which exceeds the $148k SGD you say you'll be paid. And note that if you pay more than $17.4k in housing expenses per year, which is likely, any excess can also be excluded by from US taxation.\n\nIf your income really does exceed these amounts though, you can use the Foreign Tax Credit on the remaining income. In that case, yes, you will pay the difference in US and SG tax to the US (which would probably be in the neighborhood of 10% to 15%). Annoying, but it is what it is. And that only applies on the additional income; *you do not lose the use of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion or your standard deduction*. (Edit: Also, there may be savings on state tax, depending on your state of residence and the nature of your employment in Singapore.) You can also contribute to a Roth IRA (potentially via the backdoor Roth IRA approach) with your unexcluded earned income.\n\nIn terms of cost of living... I find many of the statements and calculators about CoL to be misleading. Many of them don't consider tax savings in different locations; they're post-tax costs. You also need to consider what you will actually be caring about.\n\nLet's take a look at [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=Washington%2C+DC&country2=Singapore&city2=Singapore&amount=108000&displayCurrency=USD), for example (which says that the CoL in DC is higher than in Singapore, so I'm confused what you're reading). Included in the comparison is the cost of a car. But there's no reason for you to buy a car in Singapore, so the fact that a car is Singapore is 3x as much as it is in Washington, DC, is irrelevant. They also fail to capture the pricing in hawker centers in Singapore. You can have many inexpensive, but quality, meals at hawker centers and food courts for well below the 14 SGD Numbeo quotes.\n\nAlso, you should know that a 1BR with 800 sq. ft. is rare in Singapore. Be prepared for smaller living spaces. But, I disagree that rent in Singapore is going to be \"sky high\" compared to Washington, DC. It's comparable, although probably a bit higher in Singapore.\n\nI don't think your pay is unreasonable. I'd rather be making $148k SGD in Singapore than $108k USD in Washington, DC. You are well-paid with that amount as a single person in Singapore."

They are meaningless since your life and expense profile will be completely different, from experience I can tell you 150k in Singapore go much, much further than any major US city. I do however recommend splurging on rent, though. I know $1800 gets you a massive place in the suburbs (where I grew up) but I don't know about downtown prices.\n\nFood is extremely cheap. You're going to have to ditch your American notion of dining out only at restaurants. Most Singaporeans eat at food centers, plus you can also get almost anything delivered.\n\nThe other big item is transportation. Cars are overpriced in Singapore and is likely what's distorting the COL numbers you see (normal cars cost >$100k). Your best bet is to live downtown (that's where all the expats live anyway) and use public transportation. You can rent a car when you want to go on that road trip to Malaysia. Most Singaporeans do not drive.\n\nMost other things cost around the same.\n\nThere are no double taxation issues, you'll just take a Foreign Income tax credit (can't remember the name) and end up paying the same as in the US anyway. If you've ever lived across state lines, the math is exactly the same. You're have to do your FATCA reporting, etc though.\n\nBut the real questions is: if you can push for a higher salary, why would you ever not do that -- regardless of COL changes?\n\nps. I've had two American friends relocate to Singapore: one loved it and the other hated it. At the end of the day, being able to adjust to the massive differences in culture will likely have a much larger impact on your happiness than small increments to your salary."

For example, alcohol beverages in Singapore are a lot more expensive with lower quality, so if you enjoy drinking, you may find it difficut to stay here. Driving is another issue, if you enjoy driving like many others American, it will cost a lot more than US, but if you're fine with taking cab or public transport, then the cost is reasonable. Dining in Singapore are cheaper in general, but the portion is also smaller than American portion.\n\nI think the general assumption that living cost in Singapore is high mainly due to the cost of buying house and car. So you must factor in how important driving car and living in a big house is to you.\n\nYou can check the house rental fee by going to the propertyguru website by yourself"

Singapore is tiny, you can find nice areas to live a lot cheaper and still have a 30-40min door to door commute. Heck, I make twice as much as you do and wouldn\u2019t even think of living in the downtown core area.\n\nAs others have mentioned, Singapore isn\u2019t really that expensive if you don\u2019t intend on getting a car. 1.8-2.2k usd will get you a nice 500-600 sqft apartment near the city, just make sure it\u2019s near an MRT station. Public transport is generally cheap and excellent, food is a lot cheaper and there\u2019s no tipping in Singapore, just a flat 10% service charge + 7% GST. So you\u2019ll save a lot if you eat out often but alcohol is a lot more expensive, expect to pay $10-$15 usd for a beer depending on the establishment.\n\nYou\u2019ll live comfortably after tax on 148k sgd, not luxurious but comfortable and slightly higher purchasing power that what you\u2019re getting right now in DC. IMO 180k sgd would be pushing it..."

You might have use case for FEIE but do your own maths.\n\n\u201cIt is important for expat taxpayers to remember that you cannot claim both of these benefits for the same income. For example, if you exclude all of your foreign earned income using the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, you cannot use any taxes you paid on that excluded income to qualify for the Foreign Tax Credit. However, it is possible to claim both of these benefits by allocating a portion of your qualifying foreign income to each. An expat tax professional can help you determine the best way to use these tax benefits to your advantage\u201d \n\nhttps://www.taxsamaritan.com/tax-preparation-services/expatriate-tax-services/foreign-earned-income-exclusion/"

She told me how she had to buy over secondhand equipment, bowls and cutlery. She even had to go through a tasting at the school. She told me that she had to put a couple stalks of bokchoy in the soup so it looks \u201chealthy\u201d and have whole prawns and fishballs.\n\nMy aunt used prawn heads and shell to boil soup for prawn noodles and makes tom yum soup from scratch. I wasn\u2019t sure how much that would cost, but I\u2019m guessing the costs add up because she told me she eventually had to half the prawns and fishballs. She also only put 1 stalk of bok choy because end of the day, the vegetables get tossed by the children. While she loved serving children, she eventually closed down her business. I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t profitable and was too much work. She then went on to work as a drink stall helper at a secondary school, which also closed down.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much food in primary school cost now. 15 years ago when I was in primary school, all I had was white rice with 1 fried egg and soy sauce on top for 50 cents. Now that I\u2019m in Uni, I pack my own lunch to save money. However, on days where I didn\u2019t pack my own food, I\u2019m lucky enough to have $2.50/$3 cai png. My friends and I always wonder how the uncle makes money selling food this cheap, but we are also super grateful, otherwise other stalls have food easily 2-3 times the price."

I personally won't. There are far many options outside of school that can get my moneys worth of food but why would i choose school food? If you are to price the food high nobody is going to buy. But if you were to price it reasonable then students would find it reasonable to buy it. \n\nAnd you can't compare to hawkers as hawkers rental ain't cheap some can cost even upwards of 4k SGD. This doesn't even include manpower and utility bills and etc. So 1.5k sgd is extremely reasonable for a canteen store already. Furthermore there are way lesser options in a canteen store. Imagine you are in a hawker center with hundreds of stores but your food is kind of average. Not many people would buy it. So if you were to open a hawker then your are literally doomed to fail unless your food is above average. But in a canteen atleast people would buy it as there isnt much choices."

Price your goods accordingly because if they wanted to food prices to be similar to hawker centre prices they would just charge you hawker rental and utilities rates.\n\nManpower is your prerogative. So don't add this to the mix.\n\nIf the hawkers can operate from 8am to 10pm every day, I'm sure managing inventory for 7 hours less is wayyyyy more manageable both in terms of storage and transport.\n\nGet over yourself.

I mean, ya you can consider it forced no pay leave but they could use that time either to pursue their interest or a side job (example: forex trading or being a GrabFood rider).\n\nOpen market also means more competition. You could have 3 chicken rice stalls but only the best sells to make a profit, the other to break even and the worst to not sell any substantial amount at all. With school canteens you could sell shitty food but still have customers simply because students have a time restraint (no time to queue) or food variety. Also realistically it isn't 24/7 and in fact most stalls I believe aren't even open for all 3 meals of the day. They'd be working an upwards of 12 hours if that's the case considering opening and closing time =/= working hours.

Of course with the covid situation this won't be at the top of MOE worries however with the growing discontent between stall owners and parents alike, this issue might be bigger than we all expect, in a few years anyways."

But costs is still there. \n\nTbh, some vendors are generous with their portions, and would attract more returning customers (students and teachers). Others who tend to be stingy will likewise have smaller customer base. So even if working in a school, should still provide quality food - students and teachers are normal people attracted by good food also. \n\nSome vendors like to do 'under the table' sales by selling fried food outside of the meal set.

Usage of various ingredients also fluctuate week to week due to holidays/half-days/in-school event catering so sometimes that minimum amount cannot be met.

You sound exactly like the PAP MP who expects Singaporeans to have more than 1 job.\n\nIt sounds pretty rude to assume that just because you are a school canteen operator/worker you are therefore low-skilled and are incapable of picking up new skills. Also I just gave forex trading as an example at the top of my head, I don't expect most of them or most people for that matter to do it, but still some can and should.\n\nAlso, never did I suggest that they take up another job whilst being a school canteen operator/worker, I merely said they could do it as a side job, i.e. as like a student would taking a temp job during their holidays. Perhaps the word \"side job\" might not have been the right word for what I meant.\n\nTo be fair also, you made it sound like being a canteen operator/worker isn't a full-time job with all the non-school days being off days so you can't really expect them to rely on that job for sole income.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In a coffee shop you can reasonably expect there to be 1 stall of each type with minimal overlap.

Economically wise it doesn't even make sense. You will never have enough traffic at 2 or 3am to even make it feasible keeping your stall open till then. And you say hire extra manpower like it doesn't add a significant cost."

                "comment": "I'm also a fresh uni grad a little older than you, and our time frame to move out in 2-3 years is the same.\n\nFirstly, I started taking stock of my current situation (living w family), the benefits of it(laundry, food, utilities taken care of, having people to chat and play with) and then cons(no privacy-shared bedroom, no serious work space).\n\nNext, I went on to rental sites like 99.co and property guru to look at rental apartments, just to get a feel of what budget gets me what. I highly recommend you do this.\n\nIt's become apparent to me that the rental market in Singapore suffers from not only low quality demand, but low quality supply. Let me elaborate.\n\nSpend some time browsing and you will soon realise that most common rooms tend to be in older HDBs and when reflecting on what I have at home, it is a huge huge downgrade for me in terms of standard of living. I also do not want to move into an apartment with landlords living in it. In no way can I imagine my standard of living improving in this situation and so I don't see sense spending money this way. People here say 800$ for a common room is good living. That's not for me.\n\nNext I looked at smaller studios/1BR/2BR places. Continue browsing and you'll notice that what little  HDB flats advertised are in deplorable condition. The worst one I saw looked like it had been sitting accumulating dust after going through a fire.\n\nThis leaves condos. What I noticed though, is that many of the listed condos are poor in quality. Meaning that they are from batches of condos marketed to the middle income older generation as investment property. So they had been priced well for them at sale, and many probably planned to pay for mortgage with rental income. These means that they tend to be really really tiny(not such a bad thing-easy to clean yada yada), have a kitchen in the living room(not conducive to heavy cooking). Most importantly they aren't furnished, and if they are, it's with the ubiquitous black pleather sofa(why idk, because it's an overly large eyesore for the space it sits in). Again, browse these sites and imagine yourself actually living in it. Imagine how you would go about furnishing the place, how you would be cleaning it, how you would be commuting from it to work, etc etc. \n\nThen comes the price (rmr you need to get furnishing). These condos tend to be 2-3k. \n\nSo, to get my own place I would probably need a salary of around high 6-8k take home. And when it comes to this, I don't think rental will be sensible anymore. Why? Because if with this income, you might as well buy property. The rental is almost the same as the mortgage. That's how these units are funded.\n\nWhile the absolute numbers here may not be directly relevant to you, I hope my thinking process helps you plug holes you might not have considered. I consider everything in comparison to my current standard of living, which through this process I have come to realise is pretty high, even as it is all I have known.\n\nTil then I will continue browsing these rental places online. Perhaps I'll get lucky spotting a new bto up for rent in the low 2k. And keep an eye out for roomies."

                "comment": "Are you currently in a stable, committed relationship? Do you have friends who moved out of your parents' house by that age range?\n\nThe reason why I asked these questions is the only people I know who moved out are\n\n(1) getting married and (2) expats friends.\n\nIt is rare for SG to be moving out early and alone at that age range. Even in the late 20s, the only one I know who moved is because she does not have a good relationship with the family. I only moved out when I was 30, and I moved to Japan. I only earned SGD2.2K that time. After CPF deduction, I took home 1.8K. It is possible to move without much money, but you must plan at least 1-2 years ahead.\n\nYou should be able to move after saving for at least 1-2 years with a pay range 3.5K. Rent (aim for SGD700-800. Private room with aircon, sharing kitchen and bathroom with others) If you can tahan without an aircon, it will be awesome as getting a fan will save you a lot of money. But with SG's weather, it's incredibly hard. If you include wifi, electricity bills, it can be around 1k. Phone plan, I pick the cheapest plan, so I pay less than SGD10 per month. Don't forget that you also will want to furnish your room a bit. This will add up.\n\nTransportation in SG is very affordable as long as you don't go out too much socialising and avoid taking Grab. Moving near your workplace will do miracle. You can have some social life, but hitting the bars every weekend will not be realistic. In fact, social life tends to cost so if you want to save, you need to think twice who you hang out with. Cook more. Cook your lunch and pack them to work. Less food delivery, eat more hawker food; these can save money. I am an awful cook, but I learnt to cook better when I live alone, because eating out often can hurt the wallet.\n\nTravel-wise, if you stick to SE Asia and Taiwan, it's doable. Japan, Europe, Australia, etc.; it may be difficult unless you increase your wage.\n\nYou may also need to adjust your expectation as\n\n(1) you are still young\n\n(2) you haven't found a job. The current economy is really terrible and won't recover for the next 2 years, so you need to be extra careful\n\n(3) Things change, and especially if you are in a serious relationship, this will change drastically.  But never settle down with someone just because you want a house, or more financial stability. It will turn ugly later and ended up paying a hefty price (Divorce).\n\nI can understand why you want to move. But it's a road less travelled. Moving out alone is breaking a social norm in SG. I genuinely feel like I am an adult when I moved out and I was super happy. I also realised I took my family (especially my mum) for granted. She did so much for me, like house chore, laundry and she is a great cook. But my mum is a conservative Chinese mum. She will nag at me for trivial stuff and imposes particular outdated and not useful beliefs and I was unhappy. Thus, moving out helps in giving space. I learnt to understand myself better and know what I want to do with my life."

If your parents are demanding a high monthly payment to them, and moving out means you can reduce/eliminate that and spend it on rent instead, then moving out will mean less sacrifice in quality of life. But if your parents are not expecting any money from you once you start working, then renting is going to make a big dent in the money you \"should\" be saving for your down payment."

This may mean giving up on some part of your social life. I personally found it difficult to maintain our social life and spending habits and still put aside savings. During the time when we were renting, my savings hardly grew. Part of the reason is that I work in the CBD where my daily expenses are quite high. I never expected that my monthly expenses would be this high when I graduated. \n\nMy advice would be on a stable financial footing (enough savings put aside,  have minimal loans) before taking the decision to move out. It also depends on how badly you want to move out and how much you are willing to  limit your spending to make things work. Hope this helps!"

Its purely a mode of transport to my wife and I, and we don't think that its more convenient or it makes us feel better if we're car owners. No convenience especially when wife and I are big drinkers. For date night, we will have no less than 2 bottles of wine.\n\nAnd we looked at the cars we really want to own and drive, and the monthly costs go into 3-4k per month (that's for entry BMW coupe).\n\nOverall, its a poor financial decision so we just keep to grabbing, mrt and walking. Wife and I travel a lot for business too. So car is going to be in carpark one third of the time.\n\nAnd people who make less than 10k per month should totally avoid getting a car. Imagine 10% of income spent on transport costs! Yikes!\n\nIf the electric version of Nissan leaf is brought into SG and I move into own landed property in next few years with my own charging station, I'll drive fully electric car."

My dad's been letting me know for quite awhile how there's no one on the streets even after 4 hours of waiting, and how many grab drivers have been calling into the grab office to no avail. I honestly have no idea what the company is doing, but as of yesterday my dad told me that his rental has been cut by half, from $75 a day.  And he's also applied for GrabFood. He's also has been down to the CC to apply for the temporary relief fund which gave out I think $300? If I'm not wrong. Not much but whatever works in this climate! \n\nSimilar to you I've also been working throughout uni as a freelancer, but because of the virus situation many of my clients have stopped content production so my source of income has dried up. I think its great that you've stepped up to help your family by giving tuition, I can only wish I had this level of aptitude. If you haven't already do apply for uni FA, might not come in anytime soon but at least you'll know if you're eligible for anything. I don't have any solutions to offer sadly, but I empathise greatly and am wishing your family the best of health. Despite the shitty circumstances we operate in my dad always says to me, stay positive :-)"

Your situation sucks. \n\nTake it as a lesson when you go out into workforce, that the gig economy is not as beneficial for society as they claimed, and worker class is always marginalized. \n\nGrab serves as a matchmaking platform between supply and demand. In current situation, current demand simply don\u2019t exist at current supply. And they have no incentive to keep the excess supply, as they know once the time comes around, there will always be people who become grab drivers due to various reasons, and they have many levers to entice people joining. Since they are directly dependent on demand to generate bulk of their revenue, during normal times, they need optimize supply to meet the demand in order to maximize revenue. That\u2019s why they always entice drivers to onboard during good times and does the bare minimum to help them during bad times. \n\nOn the other hand, taxi companies in SG derives revenue from rental, diesel/petrol mark-ups, insurance, etc. They have incentives to make sure supply is always engaged even during bad times. The net cost of parking excess idle taxis and maintenance is higher than if those taxis are rented out at zero rental fees. Taxi companies revenue are less dependent on taxi driver\u2019s income, as compared to Grab. Zero rental from taxi companies while hugely beneficial for taxi drivers, is not an altruistic act. \n\nIf you want to help out your family situation. At present, borrow a bicycle from your friends, and use it to do grabfood/foodpanda/deliveroo. Demand for those will increase with the soft lockdown, as there will be zero dining out and too many young people can\u2019t cook. Last mile delivery would also see an increase in demand, so delivery/last mile enabler workers will also be needed. Instead of going zero income on tuition entirely, you could offer to be homework checker for your tutee at a smaller fee.\n\nWishing you all the best, and hope you will be able to give your parents a better life in future."

Well, you do get the car for personal use but honestly for me, theres no need for that as public transport suffice. I'm just doing this for the money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey say that the main perks of doing private hiring is the flexibility, but that's hardly true anymore because of how you get incentives to drive during peak hours. Grab has been cutting down on it's incentive, the rate is almost half of what it was last month. We're talking about $200+ lesser every week. But you just gotta live with it and make do with whatever you can get until the drivers reach their limit and do something collectively as a community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, there's still money to be made. Even more so if you're a full timer. If you go full out, 8k a month is not out of reach. But how sustainable is it to drive 12-14 hours every single day? Realistically, a disciplined full-timer who dedicates 8-10 hours with 1 rest day can aim for about 3-5k every month."

Reason he does Grab is cause he never did PSLE so he doesn\u2019t exactly have the knowledge and paper for much else. He did meddle in food businesses as a manager but he got \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d that one time so he isn\u2019t going back to that industry anytime soon. But before Grab he was a private hirer driver, basically the same thing but mainly for airport stuff. He drove a taxi as well. \n\nSo money. Uh what he earns is enough to get by but thats it. Everyday he gets about 250-300. Every week he pays rental but I\u2019m not sure how much it is. There are incentives. But they are a lot harder to achieve than last time but I honestly can\u2019t remember the numbers. \n\nHonestly if you ask me. My dad should be using the skillsfuture stuff to upgrade and find something better. He has told me he regrets not studying back in school. He did try the security courses but up till now he hasn\u2019t been interested in getting a job in security side. He tried but he just wasn\u2019t down for the jobs there were available and the industry is pretty scummy where some companies have the usual money problem of late pay and odd contracts."

                "comment": "No first hand information, but I often ask my Grab drivers about this. The predominant patterns I see are:\n\n* Discipline's important, but so is strategising. The most successful ones are out during the peak hours, such as 0700-1000, 1700-2000, and later in the night from 2200-0100, depending on the day.\n* Incentives are good some months and terrible on others. There's just no good way to gauge. The best drivers commit themselves to a certain level and work towards it. Not everyone goes for the highest tier though \u2013 some are part timers who are happy to go for Tier 2/3 instead of Tier 4, but see it as \"maximising their earnings for their time spent\" rather than \"maximising their earnings whatever the cost\".\n* Ultimately, the single biggest factor keeping people are the pay vis-a-vis the time spent, as well as the lock in periods for their car rentals.\n* Nearly all agree that GOJEK is terrible compared to Grab, both in terms of earnings and their algorithms for matching drivers and passengers."

                "comment": "I was driving Grab full time for 2 weeks last month while waiting for school to start, so I have some experience and hopefully can answer your questions.\n\nI drive about 14-16h a day, 7 days a week, typically from 7am-1pm, then 3pm-1am. The peak period starts at around 7am, if you start earlier, there's a chance you might end up in CBD too early and have to go back to the heartland area for better fares. After lunch, things start to quieten down a bit and picks up again at about 4pm, so if you want some rest or shut-eye, this is the best time to do so. The evening peak hours and nights tend to be better in terms of job availability, and I normally drive until I get a job that brings me closer to home, and then go offline from there. On a typical day, I drive about 400-500km.\n\nBy doing so, I earn a revenue of about high $400s to low $500 a day, but it can sometimes get up to high $500s if it's your lucky day. After deducting rental ($87/day), petrol (~$30/day) and commission (20% of fares which is about $80-$100), I can take home about high $200s to low $300s a day, which works out to be about $20/hr of profit. However, I have to say there is quite a fair bit of day to day variability, which I cannot account for since I have not driven long enough to notice a trend. Perhaps other drivers can help you better there. In the 16 days I've worked for, I earned about $4000, and if you maintain for a month, it shouldn't be difficult to earn about $8000, given that there are some days that I did not drive a full day.\n\nAs for the incentives, the most recent update severely limited what we can earn in terms of incentives, with each gem (think of it as points) giving you $0.40, instead of about $0.85 last time. They also have a rental rebate, which gives you back 6% (I think) of your fares to offset your car rental.\n\nGoJek is definitely better for incentives, esp the most recent one. If you hit the max target in a day, you get an extra $205 of profit, which is certainly doable if you drive the whole day. They recently upped the incentive, but I haven't checked it out in detail, so I can't help you there.\n\nHowever, I do have to agree with what the others have said. GoJek's matching seem to be quite flawed, as I had a few jobs where I had to drive about 10 minutes to get to the customer, and there is some waiting around involved during the lull hours. The fares seem to be lower on GoJek as well, but to put it in another perspective, regardless of whether you drive on Grab or GoJek, the fares of the jobs you get will always be lower since most customers are price sensitive and would opt for the cheaper option anyways.\n\nHope this helps clarify! Feel free to PM me if you need more info"

                "comment": "Full time Grab veteran here. There is absolutely good money still to be made, under certain conditions at least. The biggest one being the often-overlooked one, are you okay with driving a lot. Drive to KL non-stop, spend half an hour at a hawker center, drive back. Nine hours in the car, does that sound like a lot? Because to me, that's Tuesday. Wednesday, time to do it again...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as the money goes, I drive a total of about fifty hours a week. Which is less than you'd think honestly, because I don't have a commute sucking up time before/after work, and it's potentially spread across seven days, not five. After all car expenses are paid for, I pocket about $1k a week (and of course I get a car to drive, how valuable is that perk to you personally?). IMO, the people who can't make that much are doing one of two things wrong. The first/obvious one being driving a car that has crappy fuel mileage. If you're driving for hire full time, most cars have crappy mileage (kilometerage?). Grab's two most popular rental cars use less than 7L/100km. If your car uses 10+, that's a lot of money spent wasting fuel. At 10L/100km you're spending over $100 more per week on fuel than I am. Is your current car worth spending an extra $400+ a month on? Use the right tool for the job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe larger thing that people get wrong (in the sense of \"making less money per hour\") is driving too many lower-income hours. The middle of the day is slow, so working from 7-7 isn't going to get you $30+ an hour. The best times are weekends, like 10am to 11pm (A couple weeks ago I drove seven hours on Sunday and got $290 in fares). During the week, the best times are 5:30 -10:30pm. Mornings not quite so much so, you got the double whammy of bad traffic, and high downtime whenever you have to drive from Downtown to a suburb without a passenger. Also it's only busy for about two hours, 7:30-9:30, goes down fast after that. The rest of the hours of the day are well, the rest. So the key to making good money is to get a lot of those hours I listed. Seven hours on weekdays (bit more on Friday), fourteen on Saturday, twelve on Sunday. How many of those 62 hours are you willing to work? This isn't a 9-5 job where you hang with your buddies on the evenings. Evenings and weekends is where the money's at. If you work a six day week, your day off is Monday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as the incentives go, well yeah Grab just lowered things a bit. That said, they used to adjust the incentives every single week. And in truth, it doesn't matter that much. I mean sure you want to optimize the bonuses when practical, but the incentives are mostly just there to encourage certain hours more than others. And in the long term, the average hourly rate has stayed remarkably constant. Early on, when fares were super cheap to attract new customers, and there was a lot of downtime, incentives were higher to compensate. When LTA screwed up the rollout of the PDVL license, and a lot of drivers got forcibly sidelined, there were surges all the time, and drivers did made more money despite the incentives going down. When Grab absorbed Uber drivers over the course of two weeks, the price plummeted (despite the conventional opinion, the Uber merger made Grab far cheaper). But but, you say, weren't prices rising in April and May? Yeah, but Grab took in the Uber drivers back in early March, it only got into the press because of LTA in April. And what was happening in April? After seeing a month solid of lower fares, drivers started leaving. A process that accelerated in April and May, then stopped by the end of June, with income having returned to... the same place it was the summer of the previous year. So if Grab lowers the incentive too much, some drivers will quit, and surge will go up until income returns to the long-term average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Drive the right hours in the right car, make $1k+ a week, learn to eat late dinners."

They are used by its fleet of 660 electric subcompact cars.\n\n> Since its launch two years ago, the car-sharing scheme has attracted more than 55,000 members who currently make around 40,000 rentals a month - up from 15,000 a year ago.\n\n> The fleet has clocked more than 8 million km since.\n\n> It is on track to expand its fleet to 1,000 cars, and grow the charging network to 2,000 points by next year.\n\n> Also to mark its second anniversary, BlueSG launched two new subscription plans on Thursday: a Premium six-month membership plan priced at $18 per month with a rental rate of 33 cents per minute, and 45 minutes of free rental per month; and a Basic plan with no commitment, priced at $8 per month with a rental rate of 33 cents per minute.\n\n> Related Story Owners of electric vehicles can pay to use BlueSG chargers from today\n\n> Managing director Franck Vitte said the new plans are in response to \"growing demand from our customers for more flexibility\".\n\n> He said the plans are targeted at \"those who do not want to commit and still enjoy the lowest rental rate, or for the more regular users who can get free rentals\".\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "With exception of Tesla most BEV from major carmakers are sold officially here. Kona, Niro, Zoe, ipace, taycan.\n\nOne reason they sell poorly is due to high road tax. Tax structure in place dates back from 2008 and is based on kW rating which becomes obscenely high for a modern EV. Kona for example has same road tax as a 3 litre V6 petrol(about 2200/year). A toptrim Taycan or Model S will have over 12000/year in road tax, almost double a W12 Bentley or V12 rolls royce.\n\nComparing running cost for an average driver using petrol car or EV and the petrol unfortunately comes out ahead due to roadtax. \n\nAnother reason is charging possibilities whether real or perceived. There has been huge improvement of this past year with SP fast chargers and other smaller initiatives such as bluesg mentioned here. Now just need something for all HDB carparks.\n\nOne more reason is the additional VES rebate for EV is minor compared to overall price and comparing to hybrids.\n\nNext year with VW id3, Volvo XC40 electric there may be a change as at least you will have more attractive proper premium EV on the market here despite the other cons i mentioned. \n\nWithout any revision to policies pricing in emissions or incentives to choose EV over ICE it will be very slow EV adoption process in SG. I really hope this changes asap."

With a good overnight charging system mass deployed a car with lower range such as ioniq is ideal.\n\nThe updated ioniq getting poor reviews though due to denser battery limiting charging speed greatly. Only get 10-13kW so a full charge at fast charger will be very slow. This doesn\u2019t matter if you can charge overnight but someone considering weekly fast charge a Kona Long Range is best. With that car charging once a week is enough if you are average driver."

From that point onwards, they have little to no customers ar clarke quay, orchard. Changi is also not worth the trip with no short-term visitors in singapore.\n\nSince this week, business has dropped again due to many office workers starting to work from home, and many schools starting home-based learning.\n\nGrovery delivery option however, is increasing in demand and it helped me. I was jobless for a while now, with my employment confirmed but delayed due to the virus. But I can at least still get some income from being a grocery delivery person due to the rise in demand.\n\nHowever, the supermarket is still crowded with people and I'm sure it will be worst tomorrow. There are announcements in the supermarket to adhere to the 1m social distance is hard because there is no one enforcing it, and the lanes are so small. Not sure if I want to continue with this due to my ageing grandparents at home. But I'll save that discussion for another time."

I can't tell if working FT retail/fnb is better than this but... unless you're really focused on what you want out of this stint and are willing to sacrifice a little of your sanity and social life, chances of burning out will be higher. but really ah... no"

The value of the internship comes from a good company giving you a chance to be perm or to show the exposure u went through.

It's street hire industry is definitely going to be a sunset industry catering to the older group.\n\nComfort should use this opportunity to buy over Uber SG instead. But this is also an opportunity and risk, having to maintain this IT unit, to consistently improve it's logarithms, and it's security. This will be a wholly new field for Comfort, deviating from it's usual transport business. They don't really have a choice, not entering the field will result in them being outdated and obselete."

With Uber out of the picture, there is a slim chance that they'll start enforcing customer-friendly policies (such as forced pickup) at the expense of drivers. Forced pick up actually makes things much easier for Grab (easier time estimation, increased pick ups means increased revenue, etc).\n\nEither way, with Uber out of the way, someone's going to get screwed. Either the drivers or the riders. Here's hoping it's not both sides."

Sure uber can do it if they want to but is it worth their effort?\n\nAnd don\u2019t even mention money, uber is burning money at a rate larger than ComfortDelGro\u2019s market cap.

Win for taxi operators that's not Comfort, as they may get more \"sales\"/trips/passengers.\n\nBut for Comfort which has a huge fleet of cabs and the current market leader, partnering Grab means giving them a piece of the pie for FREE, just so to be included in Grab. This means that a slice of the cab fare revenue goes to Grab just for providing the app platform.\n\nIf that's the case, I am not sure if this is a great business decision for Comfort. The recent uberflash partnership results in comfort drivers to earn less compared to a street hire or booking trip as Comfort is not subsidizing the shortfall in the cab revenue. Hence comfort drivers earn less in exchange for more trips that can be completed as compared to waiting for booking or street hire at.\n\n\nThen where does Comfort's revenue come from? It is from the cab rental. Rental for Comfort cabs is 90? Reduced to 70? (Not sure of the numbers) and that LionCity rental and Grab Rental is much lower IIRC. Then essentially Comfort will have drivers returning cabs to them as they can get cheaper vehicles and Comfort will suffer in rental revenue.\n\nTLDR: Comfort needs to rival Grab or end up being just a taxi fleet renter company."

In fact, SMRT wanted to sell its taxi business to them & get a directorship seat, but settled for a partnership deal along with 4 other taxi operators instead.\n\nIronically, they have better corporate management & don't helicopter their Asian businesses like Uber infamously do. ComfortDelGro was pretty desperate to buy a majority stake into Uber, who now predictably wants to cash out its remaining stake. Yet, Grab's allied vehicle fleet can't surpass against ComfortDelGro, who remains the dominant operator & can bid their time waiting for merging talks."

Drivers are benefiting now because of the perks and flexiblity Grab/Uber/fleet rental companies are giving them. Lower rental fees, free maintenance and also a car (NOT A CAB!) that they can drive for free.\n\nBut the huge question is what is the likelihood of Grab choosing the route of being an e-platform only? I just do not see why Grab will do that. Yes, sure it will let them concentrate just on its platform, but wouldn't having its own fleet allow them to control the supply of cars, and also prevent themselves to be at the mercy of corporate taxi companies? This is where I do not see why Grab will abandon its fleet operations segment, it is more likely to consume SMRT's fleet operations and at the same time, making SMRT solely refocus on MRT business only. The reason why it initially partnered with corporate companies was to have provide more supply of cars on its platform, and on the other hand, taxi drivers benefited from accessing a new source of booking(s).\n\nAnd again, what is stopping taxi companies to create their own app and logarithms? (Yes, the other user mentioned about the costs, expertise and experience in maintaining the app, but having an app of your own can ensure that \"cut\" of trip expenses to go back into your own pocket rather than Grab.)\n\nThat's just my thoughts. \n\n"

Lyft also kind of has a partnership with Grab where Grab will basically take Lyft's requests instead - maybe giving Lyft a small cut.

However, it was still absolutely horrible when we only had a few cab incumbents operating in Singapore. We had to wait long periods of time for a cab via phone booking, esp during peak or graveyard shift. Drivers routinely turn down people base on their destinations when hailed during peak hours. \n\nUber and Grab has forced comfort to come up with a viable booking app now, and things are in a fairly good place for the consumer. I fear the situation will worsen once Uber exits and the companies get complacent again."

Buying means you have to contend with road tax, COE, maintenance fees, etc. As the article mentioned - low upfront cost vs. high upfront cost. Further, I like the convenience of returning the car anytime without having to resell it.\n\n/u/Maplestori length of rental is subjective. A short term rental could be in months for a young guy (like yours truly), and in years for an uncle. I personally prefer rental over ownership in Singapore because I'm driving grab on the car anyway and maintenance fees would rake up given the amount of mileage I accumulate in a month."

May be worth for a expat who is new, yet to settle down, or on or two year stint. \n\nI know some are keen on leasing as they are car enthusiast and keen to try the latest and a variety of model and are prepared to pay for it.

I sat next to the driver and was horrified to see the driver uncle doze of multiple times at traffic lights. I woke him up myself at two traffic stops after the light turned green, and asked him if he was OK, and to drive safe. He just said - like this every day, what to do.\n\nThe next Uber pool I took from my friends' house to my own, the driver went wild with anger at one traffic stop, pointing to the car beside us. A female westerner was driving, and the Uber driver insisted it was Uber or Grab, hollering how Ang Mohs and Indians are driving Uber/Grab now, prodding us to keep looking in the other car's direction.\n\nUber and Grab are no doubt passenger-friendly, but it ate up the regular taxi market - drivers saying up to 30-40%, and added to their stress and work hours. Competition is healthy, but it is driving them to work insane hours."

Uber drivers, like taxi driver, have to pay the car rent everyday as such they money they usually is split like this \n300 (total)= 150 (rent)+ 50 (Diesel or whatever) +leftovers (family usage). So getting as much extra money as possible to give the family for bills and meals. This is the split and uber drivers probably have a much lower rent but yea it's tough out yea it's tough out there as a driver."

They will only use drivers until self driving cars become a reality. \n\nThink about it. Right now Uber either owns the cars that it rents out to drivers (so they make maybe zero or some very small amount on the rental and they make their 15-20% per ride) or they let people use their own cars in which case they again make 15-20% on each ride. \n\nNow imagine if Uber builds it's own self driving fleet where pretty much 100% of all revenue comes to them. This is why the company is so valued, even though they're bleeding money quarter after quarter, year after year. Well, they're also bleeding money because they're fighting tooth and nail in several markets to capture market share."

Meritocracy guides the allocation of goods and powers based on merits, and the proxy to assess such merits is the so-called success (aka achievements). But success/achievements usually are not due purely to an individual's effort and talent. Privileges and luck play a fair part too. All successes and achievements depend on many many conditions, never fully to an individual.\n\nSo the problem isn't with the principle of meritocracy. The problem is with assessing merit. What sort of proxies should we measure in assessing merit? This is the tough question that needs to be tackled, imo."

Thanks for saying this.\n\nI've been thinking about moral character for quite some time and been wondering how people usually assess moral character. I think a big problem is that most of us tend to confuse 'kind' acts with kindness. It took me a long while to realise this. Intention is what really matters when we assess moral character.\n\nJust like what you've said about donation - most people consider it a 'kind' act. But I've met enough people who donate not because of kindness, but for various selfish reasons (like reputation for example). Yet there are so many in our society who would say - \"Look, he's such a kind philantropist, donating so much money for a noble cause!\"\n\nYet there are also some super rich people I know who also donate a lot, and they are really genuine about it (at least that's how I feel). That's the challenge, how do we tell kindness from fakeness?\n\nI think a good measure of a person's so-called kindness, is not by the type of 'kind' acts he does, but by how he does them. True kindness, I feel, comes straight from the heart. If we are discerning enough and has the opportunity to spend enough time with the person, we would be able to ascertain if the person is generally kind in the heart when he does things or if he's just putting up a show.\n\nAs such, any specific metrics we come up with to measure moral character will eventually be gamed by some people. And yeah, like what you've rightly pointed out, in principle it seems right to weigh moral character as merit, how we run a system effectively based on such a principle is the real challenge."

Again, vehicle ownership will reside with the privatehire operator, which is exempt from the MAS restriction introduced in 2013 and revised in 2016.\n\n> But for those who still prefer to own their cars, simply registering the vehicle as a rental car will avail the motorist to higher loans.\n\n> All these methods have contributed to a shrinking population of privately owned passenger cars.\n\n> According to LTA statistics, the number of such cars fell from 540,063 in 2013 \u2013 the year privatehire operators arrived \u2013 to 502,187 in 2017, before creeping up to 509,302 last year. In the same timeframe, private-hire cars grew from 16,396 to 66,480. By the end of last month, the cohort had swelled further to 72,646.\n\n> Another method is to buy a car approaching 10 years old. Loans for such cars, including those from major banks, will cover the cost of the certificate of entitlement (COE) prevailing quota premium as well as the foregone scrap value of the car.\n\n> This has contributed to the COE renewal trend. Last year, the number hit a record 37,114. In the first six months of this year, it has already reached 29,616.\n\n> Meanwhile, industry watchers reckon some changes to car loans are afoot, and these could come from either the MAS or the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), which covers the Hire Purchase Act.\n\n> When contacted, an MTI spokesman pointed out that the ministry had amended the Hire Purchase Act in 2013 and revised it in 2016 to align with MAS car loan rules. But she was unable to say if further changes were planned.\n\n> Speculation is that the Government may apply restrictions across the board, regardless of whether a car is for individual or business use.\n\n> An MAS spokesman said the authority \u201cis supportive of the prudent extension of credit to businesses, including private-hire operators\u201d.\n\n> \u201cMAS monitors the level of credit extended to businesses, and major corporates\u2019 profitability and debt servicing ability, as part of our ongoing surveillance of financial stability risks,\u201d she added.\n\n> Motor traders said the authorities should just have one ruling, no matter what the car is used for. A senior manager with a major car distributor also said while banks are generally compliant, their intermediaries are largely not.\n\n> He said: \u201cSmaller credit companies and used car dealers, which take bulk loans from banks or bigger finance companies, provide individual loans without following lending guidelines.\u201d\n\n> \u201cOnce you walk into the Automobile Megamart (a major used car and parallel import centre), you will see all these offers of low down payment. They are displayed openly,\u201d he added.\n\n> KEEPING A CLOSE EYE\n\n> MAS monitors the level of credit extended to businesses, and major corporates\u2019 profitability and debt servicing ability, as part of our ongoing surveillance of financial stability risks. \u2019\u2019\n\n> AN MAS SPOKESMAN\n\n> SMALLER FIRMS\u2019 STRATEGY\n\n> Smaller credit companies and used car dealers, which take bulk loans from banks or bigger finance companies, provide individual loans without following lending guidelines. \u2019\u2019\n\n> A SENIOR MANAGER, who works for a major car distributor.\n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

To me, it was practically useless to take class 3 as I dont own a car right now and if I do own one in the future, the amount of manual options will be lesser and lesser. The amount of lessons used to learn manual will normally be more hence the cost to get a license will be higher (if cost is a important aspect to you when learning). \nIt is much easier to pass Auto driving test as well. Took 19 lessons, 1 practice lessons and one TP test for me at SSDC. Furthermore the myth(?!?) of not being able to rent car in overseas for class 3A is not true at all(based on my research). Lastly if you are going the private route, find a good instructor based on someone that you know recommendation. "

With practice you can gain back your confidence, but there's not much you can do about a missing license.\n\nIt'll seem hard at first but it's something  that will become second nature after a while. There's certainly more steps than an auto car, but when you're proficient you'll hardly notice the difference. "

You will face such an event some day). A very useful skill to have since as humans, we are social creatures.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1. Shut up and active listen\n\n2. Stay away from cliche comments, e.g. \"Time heals all wounds\"\n\n3. Affirm your belief in the other person. What are their strengths, the things that they've gone through that was worse than what they are handling now\n\n4. Just being there with them\n\n5. Timing is everything, there is a time you give the talk, and a time when you let them have their moment to shine\n\nThis goes to /u/AveLucifer, I was too quick on giving my comments perhaps, and it's not what you want or need. I haven't had talks with you much, so who am I to give good advice to you? But nevertheless, you got r/singapore here, and maybe from other subforums as well (if you frequent r/CasualConversation, they're pretty awesome) if you want to talk. \n\nAnd this last bit of paragraph below is to someone who hasn't been seen here in a while, but I know that person still lurks around. And that person just dropped a pretty big bomb on me very recently. I don't know whether that person will ever see this, but...\n\nI really am sorry that it had to happen to you. I always said you are cute, charming, nerdy (in a good way), smart and adventurous (enough). From the talks we had or posts I've seen, you are a caring and appreciative person. I would love to actually see and chat with you again, and we can talk about nothing or anything and everything.\n\nEDIT: In the 7 minutes since I posted this, it became -1 already? Wow Downvote Brigade, you're really following me through, aren't ya? And I see you've been quite busy today with other posters as well.\n\nEDIT2: 20 minutes and it's already -3? Wow guys!"

                "comment": "> Is car rental an option in SG?\n\nWas just discussing car rentals with my colleague yesterday - nope, car rental in the long term works out to be about the same as buying a car here. The only upside is that you don't have to pay the 50% downpayment that's required of the COE, but beyond that renting cars works out to cost as much as buying one."

It's cheaper if you rent a car in Johor Bahru. \n\nFor trips to Malaysia for a foreigner, I would suggest to you to just take the numerous bus services from SG for a start .. the roads/ signage are all different from the US, takes some getting used to"

I grumbled for a while, before settling back on track before passing that damned module for good.\n\nSure, you can bitch and whine about it all you want. But having suicidal thoughts just simply because you failed a module, the heck? There're people out there who're trying their best effort in their studies, while you're losing yourself simply because of a setback?\n\nI'd suggest if you take a full day chilling out somewhere quiet and peaceful, perhaps this might help ye sort out your thoughts as well. Cheers. "

But for a new foreigner, it's best if you don't do the rental for day trips thing unless you know the culture and terrain well or if you are prepared to take the risk (or are street-savvy enough). \n\nBut don't let the stuff Singaporeans tell you scare you away from JB :PP it's got cheaper services (Hair!

                "comment": "SINGAPORE - Two local motor companies have bought Uber-owned Lion City Rentals, marking the United States ride-hailing firm's complete exit from Singapore.\n\nWayDrive Holdings, a new joint venture between vehicle trader Motorway Group and workshop operator Toh Motor, signed on the dotted line on Friday evening (Jan 4) to acquire 100 per cent of Lion City Rentals (LCR) for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThe Straits Times understands the transaction involves some 8,000 cars that are two years old and above, and an acquisition price of around $350 million.\n\nWhen contacted, Motorway chief executive Michael Lim said the deal will include the takeover of about 150 Lion City Rentals employees, as well as its rented premises.\n\nAsked why he was buying over the company when the market is deemed over-supplied with cars, Mr Lim said: \"Eighty per cent of LCR cars are rented out.\n\n\"We are also in talks with Grab and Gojek to supply them cars. We will have a fuller picture in two to three weeks' time.\"\n\nMr Lim said the acquisition has been four to five months in the making, and that there were at least two other motor dealers who were in talks to buy over LCR.\n\nThe deal comes eight months after Uber and ComfortDelGro called off an agreement for the local taxi giant to purchase a 51 per cent stake in Lion City Rentals for $642 million.\n\nComfortDelGro\u2019s purchase agreement was inked in December 2017. Three months later in March 2018, Uber announced its exit from the South-east Asian market.\n\nUber did not respond to press queries on Saturday, but a spokesman said last September that \"Lion City Rentals continues to partner with thousands of drivers and hirers every day in Singapore and remains committed to the market\".\n\nIn an e-mail sent to employees on Friday, Uber chief international business officer Brooks Entwistle described the deal as \"good news for Uber and WayDrive... and great news for Lion City Rentals employees and customers\".\n\nHe said Lion City Rentals \"business fundamentals are solid\".\n\nIn another e-mail to driver-hirers, Lion City Rentals said the transaction \"will not result in any changes to your experience\", and that there would be no change to their contracts.\n\nAlthough some industry players expect Motorway's Mr Lim - known for his business acumen - to turn the loss-incurring Lion City Rentals business around, others are surprised by the deal.\n\nOne said: \"Drivers today prefer fuel-efficient hybrid cars. Most of their (Lion City Rentals) cars are not hybrids.\n\n\"And in this business, a two-year-old car is considered old. Each week, these cars can clock up to 10,000km, as the drivers drive for 10 hours a day or more to survive.\""

It's pretty easy to get demerit points nowadays. Parking will likely catch you out, since you are a new driver. That's worth a few points on its own. Not to mention the red light camera. They change from amber to red very quickly. You might not have the reaction time to deal with it. \n\n2. Cars are extremely expensive to fix. Small dent, small scrape, it will cost you an arm and a leg back at the rental firm. When you rent a car, you have to be aware of all the damages on the car. It has to be photographed and written down. Unless someone experienced goes with you to collect the car, chances are that you will miss things that will be used against you when you return the car. The salesman will gloss over the damage when you collect it, but make a big deal when you return the car. That's how it works, and you have to be aware of it. \n\n3. most firms don't rent to P-plates. If they do, they require a higher deposit and higher insurance excess. It's not uncommon to hear of excess of 10k for a P-plate rental car. \n\n4. If you do wanna rent, go for the bigger more established firms. They will be more upfront and honest in their dealings. Their prices will definitely be higher. But you can be sure that they won't try to makan you on hidden damages. Their cars tend to be newer / more well maintained. \n\n5. Driving on your own with a P-plate is unlike driving a car with a L-plate. Most motorists don't give a shit if you are P-plate. They will cut your lane anyhowly or jam brake as they like. It's a very scary world out there. \n\nFeel free to post any questions and I'm sure others will be willing to advice you. "

Most rental companies have an excess of $4k and above, and they are usually in cahoots with their own workshops to inflate the repair costs such that you are forced to pay the full excess. My friend accidentally reversed his rental car into a pole and there was a slight dent, when he returned it to the rental company they sent it to the workshop and the workshop said it affected the structural integrity of the car\u2019s rear and he had to pay $3800 excess money. The dent was about 1cm in and 5mm wide. Do know what you\u2019re getting into when you rent a car, the moment you get into an accident no matter how small, be prepared to fork out thousands. "

They are pretty famous on the net.\n\nSo far I have good experience with CL Leasing and SGRentACar at WCEGA Plaza (Bt Batok area). Deposit around 200 to 300 SGD, refundable as long as you don't damage the car. ERP, parking charges, fuel, summons all borne by user. Park at your own area, no need to park at rental firm. Return fuel at level which they gave you the car at. Even if it means 1/4 tank, return 1/4 tank, don't lose.\n\nDriving is expensive business. I rented from CL when I still had P Plate, drove a Toyota Estima for two weeks. Glad to have started from a reputable, safe company. I got friends who got \"scammed\" thousands of dollars because of shaddy rental firms. As much as I had a relatively good car rental experience over two years, I wish that you have a good one too. All the best.\n\nPS: Upon two years of your license, switch to car sharing like smove or Tribecar, easier to obtain a car and generally cheaper, goes by hour etc. I rarely go to rental firms today unless driving up to Malaysia."

The trams weren't too bad, but super small and the stations weren't very conveniently located. My wife would rather spend an hour walking to her classes instead of dealing with the Cambridge buses, which were worse than Notts.\n\nFoodwise, Singapore really is spoiled for choice in not just variety, but also the ability to go out and buy food at at time they feel like it.

Compare that with our CPF. Sure you can argue they get a lot more in return, but they pay a heck of lot more for it. In Germany, I would be in the 30% bracket compared to 10% in Singapore, I can use the money to buy the best healthcare plans possible and it would still be cheaper in Singapore.\n\nHow about the US then? My friends in NYC earning my equivalent in USD are paying more than 30% effectively with federal, state, property, social security and in some places even school district tax. I\u2019m not even counting the ~9% sales tax. And what do they get back? Zilch.\n\nLastly, CPF is not a tax, you can use the money for housing. Try doing that with pension funds in other countries."

Why are you comparing raw prices instead of relative affordability? I'm assuming that this figure does not include public housing, which is quite affordable in singapore. However, if you want your children to inherit your property, that limited lease on your \"bought\" HDBs might not be such a great deal. \n\nhttps://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/gmaps_rankings.jsp\n\nTransport: Sure, parking in the US might cost more in densely populated cities. But how much do they earn in comparison to singaporeans? You are comparing raw prices instead of affordability, and this is very dishonest. Also, how much more do you pay for gas in singapore? \n\nPublic transport in major European cities is absolutely superior to public transport in singapore, even in relatively poor countries such as Poland and Hungary. The only comparative advantage of public transport in singapore is that there aren't gypsies trying to steal your shit.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income\n\nTaxes: The median income is $43.5k (PPP) in the US, and  $32k (PPP) in singapore. Even if you took 25% off $43.5k, it's still more than the pre-tax singaporean salary. If you only considered San Francisco metro, it has a median income of $85k, almost twice the US national average.

The important things are to know what the dangerous areas are, keep your wits about you (like learning how to tell quickly if an area is sketchy) and using common sense.\n\nThen there's the stereotype that everyone is fat, which is technically true for the US as a whole, but in the Bay Area, the majority of people are slim. I'm willing to bet that the average diet there is healthier than what people eat in Singapore.

I'd say that the US Social Security system is more of a tax, as there it's not \"your money\" but more of an insurance (hence it's proper term as \"Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance\"). The US government is not obliged to guarantee that people paying into SS receive all of their money back. \n\nAs for COE, yes it's a tax, but I'd say that it's not something you need to pay unless you have a strong need for a private vehicle. As much as I hate the breakdowns of our public transport system, it at least exists (as opposed to most cities in the USA for instance). \n\nGST or VAT is actually quite a common tax in any developed country."

Hence, CPF is not a tax by definition, but it is a tax in spirit.\n\nBy your definition, any investment product (whether it\u2019s bank deposits, bonds, unit trusts or shares) can also be considered a tax in spirit, since the whole point of these products is to make more money than they give out to you."

However, I believe that most Singaporeans would not be able to achieve such returns (with a similar risk profile)."

Just as how most singaporeans are better off paying tax and having the government build roads and hospitals, even though an intelligent few could conceivably have put their income tax money to even better uses. \n\nIt's just funny how everyone acknowledges that income tax is a tax, and a good thing indeed, but no one sees that CPF is pretty much identical in principle.

Bringing that concept here, *and staggering shifts*, would be to everybody's interests:\n\n* Staggering shifts would mean that a cab coming in at 04:00 wouldn't have to go out again at 04:05 with the relief driver; the guy starting at 04:00 drives a different cab, and the first one gets a look-see by maintenance before it goes out again at 06:00 or whenever;\n* You'd eliminate the \"Change Shift/Jurong East\" phenomenon that has been the scourge of so many tourists and locals alike. If a driver is on duty, he's *on duty*, and a guest can book his cab to go wherever she likes. The driver isn't stressed because he knows his meter logs will show the fare beginning before his shift ended and that he was driving up to (and a few minutes after) his shift;\n* The cab companies benefit because they get more efficient use of their cabs (no drivers denting them in carparks anymore) and they get a leg up on maintenance;\n* The guests benefit from a *far* more professional and reliable taxi service that's actually run like a *taxi service* rather than an expensive pastime for uncles who make back their rental, a little bit extra and then kick back somewhere for the rest of the shift.\n\nOdds of this happening without seismic political change weakening \"the fusion of State and corporate power\"; essentially zero.

Since they're not a listed company, there's a lot of information they don't have to make public. How many MPs and Cronies are on their board? What portion of their shares are held directly or indirectly by Temasek, GIC, or the relevant ministries of this Government? The list goes on and depressingly on.\n\nAnd again, not intending to pick on Shell here; almost *every* \"MNC\" in Singapore is like this. If you go into a brand-name outlet and think to yourself, \"this really doesn't work the same way as [this brand] in other places\", look carefully at the signage. You'll almost certainly see a \"[Brand X] (S) Pte Ltd\" sign, which is your indication that you're in something that's close to, but not the same thing as, the original thing. Still doubt any of this? Taste a Singapore \"Guinness\"."

I suspect its due to the way they calculate the distance from one place to another, but in reality, if the driver follows the route that I think the system picks, I'm going to be really unhappy as he's wasting my time.\n\nFor a route from my house to my workplace, if I select my actual workplace, the fixed price comes to ~$20. If I select a block next to my workplace, the fixed price is ~$13. Both blocks share the same dropoff point, just that the actual address is different, given that they are indeed different blocks.\n\nFor the route back home though, it quotes a fixed $20 no matter which block I pick; but on Uber, it costs barely $14 for the same route."

Not to mention to outdated and crappy booking system. Also, I have more flexibility in knowing that I can definitely pay by card without the driver's claiming that they only accept cash. "

                "comment": "**Extracted Article:**\n\n> SINGAPORE \u2014 In one of the most expensive countries in the world to own a car, Mr Peter Chiu is finding a novel way to pay for one.\n> \n> The 58-year-old retired policeman rents a car in Singapore, drives three to four hours a day for Uber Technologies to cover its cost, and has a shiny Honda Vezel the rest of the time for his personal use. Hiring a vehicle to work for Uber is becoming a more common sight in the Republic, where Mr Chiu\u2019s SUV costs more than a BMW M3 luxury sports sedan does in New York.\n> \n> \u201cBuying a car in Singapore is so expensive,\u201d said Mr Chiu. \u201cIf you want to drive around to cover expenses, that is quite easy. And any extra money you get, that\u2019s more income for you.\u201d\n> \n> New technologies are not only disrupting traditional industries in Singapore \u2014 a trend that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said will force the economy to transform \u2014 but also changing consumers\u2019 behaviour as they try to cope with rising costs and unemployment at a six-year high.\n> \n> \u201cUber is another avenue for employment,\u201d said Mr Brian Tan, an economist with Nomura Holdings in Singapore. \u201cIt makes the labour market more efficient, because it provides you with an alternative career. You don\u2019t need a special license for that.\u201d\n> \n> A Honda Vezel like Mr Chiu\u2019s typically sells for more than S$100,000 in Singapore, almost four times the price in the US. On top of taxes, car owners here are forced to buy permits \u2014 called Certificates of Entitlement \u2014 which are limited in supply and auctioned by the government to help curb road congestion and pollution. At the most recent offering this week, the COE cost S$50,789 for the smallest vehicles.\n> \n> RENTAL SURGE\n> \n> Mr Chiu drives six days a week for Uber, just enough to cover the S$500 weekly cost of his vehicle, which he rents from Lion City Rentals, a local subsidiary of the car-hailing company. He doesn\u2019t mind the part-time work.\n> \n> Between 2014 \u2014 the year after Uber began operating in Singapore \u2014 and 2015, the number of rental cars in the country soared more than 50 per cent to 29,369, surpassing the number of taxis on the road, according to official data. Even so, the total vehicle population decreased by 1.5 per cent.\n> \n> Simon, a 45-year-old former property agent who preferred to give his first name only, rents a Toyota Corolla and drives for Uber four hours a day at most. A slump in home sales since the government began imposing measures to rein in prices has pushed many in the industry to seek other sources of income, including ferrying commuters around the island for Uber.\n> \n> Simon said his main job now is making \u201calternative investments\u201d and the Uber gig allows him to have a car of his own to use on weekends, when he makes trips about 20km across the border to Malaysia with his wife and two kids. The journey has an added cost-saving advantage: He buys gas for his car in Malaysia, where it\u2019s cheaper.\n> \n> Uber is using auto rentals and financing to attract and retain drivers around the world, as are rivals such as Grab in Singapore and Lyft in the US. While for many drivers, earning an income may be the main reason they turn to the ride-hailing companies, in Singapore, having the car may be just as important.\n> \n> \u201cIt makes a lot of sense to rent a car,\u201d said Mr Tang Kin Yee, 53, whose main job is in commercial photography and advertising. Business was slow last year and he started driving for Uber to supplement his income.\n> \n> He now rents a Honda Vezel and is thinking about driving for Uber full time.

                "comment": "> #Part-time SMRT cabbies locked out of taxis in server glitch\n\n> SINGAPORE \u2014 Part-time SMRT taxi drivers were locked out of their vehicles early Monday morning (Oct 30) in a three-hour server glitch on the transport operator\u2019s short-term taxi rental service portal, SMRT Taxi Share.\n\n> Rolled out in January by SMRT, the service requires taxi drivers to prebook a taxi, head to the pick-up point closest to them, and get on taxishare.com.sg to indicate that they would like to \u201cStart Trip\u201d \u2014 a button that would only be enabled past the starting time of their booking \u2014 before their cars would be unlocked. \n\n> But drivers who went through their usual routine on Monday morning were met with an irresponsive \u2018Start Trip\u2019 button, although they were able to access the Taxi Share website. \n\n> Those attempting to end their rental reportedly faced problems doing so. Late charges are S$10 for every 15 minutes or part thereof.\n\n> In response to TODAY\u2019s queries, SMRT taxi services\u2019 general manager, Mr Shaun Lee, said: \u201cOur Taxi Partners support team is aware of the temporary server glitch this morning, and has been reaching out to the handful of affected taxi partners. We will honour our taxi partners\u2019 requests for refund upon verification.\u201d \n\n> Eight drivers took their frustration to a Taxi Share Facebook group after having troubles reaching SMRT on its hotline. The earliest post was made at 4.30am. The system was restored shortly after 7am, according to a Taxi Share user who managed to unlock his car at 7.05am.\n\n> \u201cI can\u2019t unlock the car since 6am, and now (it\u2019s) 7am. The clock (started) ticking. Please refund,\u201d said Facebook user Lester Tan who was supposed to get on the Toyota Prius he rented from 6am to 2pm.\n\n> Another driver Leslie Chang posted: \u201cI waited (for an) hour (but I) still can\u2019t contact (the) SMRT officer. Can I cancel to get (a) refund from SMRT?\u201d\n\n> Another Facebook user with the handle of Will Iam said he tried calling SMRT\u2019s customer service hotline, but he was left waiting for at least 20 minutes. \n\n> \u201cSMRT, if your system breaks down, please message or email to all drivers,\u201d he wrote in his post.\n\n> A 43-year-old driver who only wanted to known as Alvin decided not to work after he stood outside his taxi for half an hour from 6am with little clue why his car would not unlock. \n\n> \u201cSo no income today... (The Taxi Share system for the) whole (of) Singapore is down, same as their trains,\u201d he told TODAY, adding that the SMRT has promised a refund of his S$68 10-hour rental. \n\n> \u201cIt has happened to me twice so far (in seven months).\u201d\n\n> SMRT\u2019s Taxi Share scheme allows those with a taxi driving vocational license to rent taxis in three-hourly blocks by picking up and returning the taxi at a location that is convenient to them. \n\n> So far, SMRT is the only taxi operator adopting such a model where taxi drivers do not have to seek a relief driver to cover the cost of a rented vehicle should they not wish to commit full-time. \n\n> Hourly rental varies across the day between S$6.80 and S$S$12.80.  \n\n> [Source](http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/part-time-smrt-cabbies-locked-out-taxis-server-glitch)\n\n---\nv2.0 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md)"

If you really want to find the absolute best deal, try this site https://www.diffmarts.com/. It gives price comparisons for the major supermarkets in Singapore (including RedMart). NTUC always has random sales for random fruits depending on season. There's a $1.90 for 250g blueberries sale going in at least three NTUCs I visited in the past week. Cold Storage is another chain that we all know as slightly more upmarket in terms of price and products. If you live near a town centre (e.g. Woodlands, Tampines, Jurong) you can probably get more than one supermarket to choose from.\n\nYou can also get great food from hawker centres. There's at least one near you in every town. You can get a good variety of food for a very good price (think less than $5 a meal). Which is to say you don't have to force yourself to cook every day if your schedule doesn't permit, there's affordable food all around.\n\nA mid-tier restaurant would set you back about $15-20 per person. Movies on the weekends cost about $14 depending on theater.\n\n"

Hawker centre food may be cheap but it generally lacks fresh fruits and vegetables. Portion sizes are also smaller if you are coming from the US. Most Singaporeans eat a lot of hawker food because they don't cook or don't have the time to. \n\nIf you are into salads, then bear in mind that leafy vegetables like spinach, arugula (also called rockett), lettuce, etc are not cheap in Singapore although they are readily available in most larger NTUC stores. Greek-style salads of tomatoes and cucumbers are however more economical although the variety and quality of tomatoes in Singapore are not great. Yellow/red onions and bell peppers are also not cheap in Singapore. Extra-virgin olive oil is  expensive in Singapore as relatively few people eat it. However, you can try making dressing with sesame oil. I personally bring a few bottles/cans of olive oil back to Singapore whenever I go to Australia where it is much cheaper. \n\nMy wife and I prepare our own lunches everyday for health reasons. We usually make salads or bring leftovers. I estimate that a salad would cost us around $4 to 5 each.   A diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables is definitely possible and economical if you make a bit of effort. "

I'd say $100 on groceries for 2 is more than sufficient. Apples, bananas, watermelons are some of the most common fruits available. \n\nVegetables you're used to in the US - kale, spinach, broccoli etc - will be more expensive as compared to in Singapore, but it's got to do with the agriculture subsidies in the States. Cabbage and chinese spinach will not set you back by much. \n\nIn essence, $2000 for 2 people is definitely enough to cover groceries and living expenses, assuming your electricity/gas/utilities consumption is not excessive (probably about $150-200 for 2 people in a condo). Transport should be about $100-120 per person, if you're taking public transport. \n\n"

Factoring in all the various extra fees, etc. will bump this up. To make things worse, you have no CPF to help offset the upfront costs you will incur.\n\nDisclaimer: Not a property agent.

(not the agent, not the agent's company etc. unless the seller is a company. do a title search via SLA's website for $5 to verify the owner is correct). if you decide to proceed with the deal, the option period is normally 2 weeks, and to exercise the option, pay 4% (or 9%, depending on the terms). this amount will be paid to the seller's LAWYER under the lawyers conveyancing account (it will be paid to LEGAL FIRM NAME-CVY)\n6. depends on bank.\n7. honestly .. depends on the banker and your luck.\n8. increasing interest rates, finding a gf (and not having enough cash flow). property being vacant for a long period of time (law has been changed and you will still pay property tax on the prevailing rental even if property is empty)\n\ndont believe all those bullshit fliers/advertisements .. i deal with agents everyday. you never get the full truth, and once you have paid for the property, you will LLST when there is a problem.\n\nbecause you are self employed, you will have a more difficult time with the loan process.\n\ni work for an investment company and do this for a living, managing, buying,selling etc. if you don't have a medium to long term outlook/holding power.. dont bother getting into the market at current prices.\n\nalso- do not forget that if you buy your first property and its cheap (ie 3% stamp duty on 600k is not much) but for the second property (if you are that lucky quickly enough), you will pay ABSD as long as the rule is in place.\n\nwell, i hope that helps for now. if you want me to check transaction prices for a building for you, i can pull up 10 years worth of data for you. if you are worried about telling me the building name, just give me the postal district (ie, orchard road = 9) and ill generate the entire district's data for you. you can sift through it and find the building you are targeting yourself."

How about buying a conservative exchange traded fund (ETF?). The trading account is free at Standard Chartered and if you buy an emerging market government bond etf you could probably get around 4% yield a year.  \n\nMeaning for every SGD 10,000 you put in you receive about SGD 400 per year. If you are really interested in investing in property you could just buy a REIT ETF and have the same thing. \n\nIf I were you I would read the following: http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%27_Guide_To_Investing and then invest in a well diversified portfolio of index funds.\n\nYou will get more passive income that way and you can add money in every month from your paycheck without having a loan and paying interest."
