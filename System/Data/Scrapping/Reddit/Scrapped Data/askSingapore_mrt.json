It is really unfortunate that this has happened to u...  and to be honest, in this era, it might happen again, but here's what i advice.\n\nU can make a police report about this matter, but the followup matters will definitely take some of ur time. I cant promise the police will do much, other than give a stern warning. Maybe MP can help bcz it started to become has racist insults..\n\nYes, could have also approached the train staff regarding this issue, the person has clearly overstepped the boundary when words like \" slut \" / \" prostitute \"  and the part about removing the hijab comes out, that is a personal attack alrdy, no nid to show any more face to such ppl.\n\nYou are not wrong if u start secretly take video or on a voice recorder app too, it is evidence to prove that the person has really gone too far. Just dun post online without censoring the face(i really hate this new law)\nBUT u dunnid to censor the face for the original video when u submit as evidence to the police, although they can use their authority to identity by cctv by attire too.\n\nThere is also an option to show that u are a bigger person, ignoring them completely, by getting off the train especially if it is during peak hour and take the next one so u dun hab to take any insults, ur mental health is impt and next train is coming soon (~2 to ~4mins, old trains can be slightly slower, yes, stupid yearly budgets)\n\nThere are many 'crazy' ppl in sgp, which i like to believe due to stress from family or finance or friends / respect the elderlies and dun talk back culture imprinted to the current gen of elderly.\n\nFurthermore, the gov overpampering them with benefits and giving them titles of pioneer and merdeka made some of them feel that everyone is indebted to them.\n\nBUT, this does not give them (especially these boomers and pioneers) the right to do whatever they want including racist comments or insults !\n\nFrom my point of view, this toxic culture will stay for a while and we cant really get rid of it yet, with the gov is playing smart by acting blur to avoid overcommiting to this national issue."

Someone might just trip over you. I will only ever recommend sitting on the floor if it\u2019s in the train cabin with no seats and only handles. Because you won\u2019t really block people there as long as the train isn\u2019t crowded. I\u2019ll understand if you are just social distancing by sitting there. But please don\u2019t sit on the space between the glass and the door. \n\nAlso, seats are for everyone, no need to be shy about it. Students needs seats just as much as everyone else. I lived 1 hour away from my secondary school by mrt few years back. I would snag any seats I could because Tampines to Toa Payoh is tiring af. I will even sit on the reserved seat and keep an eye out for people who need it. An empty seat is just asking to be sat on lol.

I used to sit on the floor, but only between the spaces of the two carriages (the black space that juggles a lot) but I only did it when I had to wake up at 5am to catch the first train and it was crowded with people. I used to do it when I was an NSF too, and I'm sure I've have my picture stomped floating around somewhere. But I was really tired, lethargic and no available seats. It was only also during when I was really passing out and all\n\nNow I don't do it since there's plenty seats available. Personally, I don't see something wrong with sitting on the floor as long as you're not blocking people, but it's weird to do it when there's plenty of seats"

That said, the floor is dirty and takes up a lot more space than standing so it's best not to sit. Get the glass panel (next to the seat, not the one on the door!) location if you can and lean against it for a more comfortable ride.\n\nYou also really shouldn't be complaining about old age stuff unless you are at least in your mid-thirties. \n\nSo your issues are more likely due to lack of sleep or poor sleep quality, and poor sitting posture. If your back feels that bad, it's best to check out the doc. Your back can hurt for many other reasons than \"being old\"."

                "comment": "My wife has this. Fainted a few times, including on the MRT. Went to a heart doctor who diagnosed her with something called vasovagal syncope. It's when heartbeat slows and not enough blood getting to the brain. Often happens in hot weather and can be due to dehydration. It has only happened to her when drinking alcohol (even half a drink) and always when outside in hot / humid weather. The blackout / fainting is actually triggered on purpose by your system/brain to get your head lower or equal level to your heart to allow for more blood flow to the brain. \n\nThe main danger is from hitting your head and injuring yourself when fainting. \n\nIf you feel dizzy or that an episode is coming, get down to the ground as quickly as possible. Sitting is OK but lying down is even better. This will help get blood to the brain plus eliminate potential injury from a fall. Then get water or 100 Plus or whatever for hydration. \n\nBTW I'm not a doctor, this was just my wife's experience. If interested you can inquire about getting a \"tilt test\" when they actually invoke the episode on purpose by putting your body on a table at a specific angle. \n\nCertainly nothing to be embarrassed about. It happens quite regularly. But understand how it can be a bit scary."

I used to stay in a flat 2 min walk from the MRT, and currently live next to PIE. \n\nIll start with the MRT flat, where i can see the MRT station clearly from the flat. I lived on the 16th floor, and the sound of MRT wasnt that loud. It was only towards 11pm-12am ish where the neighbourhood starts to be quiet, and i can hear light noises. Not a big deal. \n\nNext, expressway. Traffic noise is annoying. Thankfully, my room does not face the expressway directly. The continuous traffic honestly sometimes just becomes music to my ears, just got used to it. What was worse is that my room faces the lobby, and i can hear every vehicle entering, like screeching of car tires or bus doors opening. Airplanes flying past are also common. These are the annoying ones which come momentarily, not continuous, and can break your train of thought sometimes. I live on 10th floor here. \n\nThankfully, my room has a not too shabby sound proofing, so if i close all windows, i wont be able to hear screeching and such. But like you, i do prefer ventilation and i also suffer from the on and off noise pollution from downstairs (not expressway). Most of the time ill just bear with it, and honestly i think, if you are really focused in your work you wont be able to hear the noises. I guess, the best way is just to not think about the noise that is distracting you."

Don\u2019t be penny wise and pound foolish unless hard up for cash.\n\nI live near an MRT, but checked exact noise level first - it\u2019s not bad enough to be an issue, but is still discernible 2 blocks away. During the quiet of the night it gets *Much* louder relatively speaking. I\u2019ve previously lived near the LRTs in Sengkang/Punggol and in the dead of the night the sound ricocheting across buildings can be annoying.\n\nExpressways are much worse, and as you say noise travels mostly upwards, but it\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019ll always see flats along expressways with windows permanently closed (you now have both noise AND heat/lack of ventilation). You shouldn\u2019t have to choose one over another.\n\nAs others have said, noise is a stress factor you\u2019ll never get used to  - and if not for you, at least for souse and kids :))"

At home, there would be continuous light traffic noises (like mentioned). The difference is huge. So i guess there is some  sound proofing in the walls, windows and even the doors. With all windows and doors closed in my bedroom, i dont hear any traffic from outside apart from the one just downstairs. That said, what i shared earlier could be different because of difference in proximity to expressway, and personal opinion. \n\nThe best way for you to know is of course to view the flat and try being situated inside your future home, with both windows closed or open, to see if it is up to your comfort. Wish you good luck."

I had a similar commute for roughly 8 months after starting my current job.

I am slightly worst than you. \n\nI work up to 10-12 hours on some days due to the nature of my job but I love my job so I don\u2019t exactly feel burn out and I lift weights (at home) 5x a week for an average of 2 hours per session. I still make time to spend time with my spouse, play with my cats, meet my friends and maybe watch some movies / chill / game / house chores on the weekends. \n\nIt\u2019s all up to individual for time management. I sleep around 6 hours a day, 3 hours to travel, if I work 10 hours I\u2019m left with 5 hours. I could allocate 2 hours to lift weights and 3 hours of spare time to do what I really want to do. \n\nWhat would make you feel better is that if you find a job you like/love and truly enjoy. As you move along the industry you would find a role that is suitable and that you enjoy. That would make things better. \n\nHaving a stable relationship with someone there for you cheering you on as you fight the daily battles does help too.\n\nEdit: my bosses are great and don\u2019t micro manage too, there are days my meetings/day start at about 8 am and sometimes at 10 so I could get that extra 2 hours of shut eye or allocate to what I want to do the day before which really helps. I do end work early on some days too. At the end of the day time management is key.\n\nI also believe your mental strength has to be strong as well. When it\u2019s time to work you work, when it\u2019s time to rest or play you rest or play. That\u2019s also important."

And there are still some households without air conditioning, which will be necessary for survival at that point. Though I think if things ever get that bad, there will be some schemes for low-income families to get AC. That's a big reason I would not want to live in Singapore long-term.\n\nThat aside, I moved to Tokyo and my life has improved by almost every measure. I've also spent a decent amount of time in the US (1 year+ mainly in California) and I think I could be quite happy there. When I returned to Singapore for a few months in 2020, I felt like I was in a limbo and that the place clearly wasn't for me. And as others have written, I was traumatized by the education system, even though I did well within it, and would never subject a hypothetical child to it. I have other Singaporean friends in those countries who intend to settle there long term. Honestly, the world out there is not quite so terrifying as people on reddit make it out to be; the 7+ billion people on this planet are not all living in misery and terror. There are lots of people who love their countries and their lifestyles. Speaking as someone working for a company employing 50+ nationalities; my coworkers had fairly normal lives in their home countries, it wasn't like 'my country is a hellish shithole so I escaped to Japan'.\n\nAnyway, since there are a bunch of comments about migration: it's all about tradeoffs and what matters to you. For example, some people value low taxes, but I am ok with paying higher taxes if there are good social programs, which Japan has. And I am not so worried about basically all other countries having higher crime rates than Singapore, because there are huge variances within a single country or even city, and it's usually possible to stick to the safe areas. I've travelled to New York City and Los Angeles, the latter alone and on a long-distance bus, cities that you would normally associate with high crime rates, and I was completely fine."

However when comparing against other countries, Singapore has done and is still doing an amazing job. It\u2019s not perfect for sure and we should always strive to improve (haha and we wonder why we are always so kiasu) but we should also have a good perspective of what we have here in Singapore.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m not Singaporean and I love it here and have decided to make Singapore my home. Singapore is one of the top in the world for Health Care, Government Services, Public Transportation, Public Housing, Safety, Corruption, Cleanliness, Government Efficiency. Given the different ways that it could have screwed up, the current results are extraordinary.\n\nI think compared to the rest of the world Singapore is also one of the top at handling COVID even if we feel that there could be way more transparency and more could be done to push vaccination.\n\nI always say that it\u2019s great to travel somewhere for a while to have a change of environment, but long term I think Singapore is a great place to live with a sane and fact-based science-based decision making from the government for the most part and don\u2019t let politics get in the way (for the most part.)\n\nEdit: Now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect here, no place is, but I\u2019d rather not turn this post into a laundry list of \u201cthings I would improve\u201d lol."

Let\u2019s assume finance and current world order is going to be the norm for the foreseeable future, with finite resources demand is and always will be greater than supply and that causes price hikes as economies of other country catch up. \n\nThe current government is good in fact it is too good and efficient. In terms of running the country there is no other government that can do better than them. Ideally we need a more humanistic touch but seriously we don\u2019t have the time to afford that and that\u2019s sad. The incumbent pap government realised that and have a feel representative like ong ye kung, tan chuan jin, sun Xue ling, Tin Pei Ling from pap that are really good and closer to residents. The ministers of state and all have greater deal of portfolio they surely do care but they don\u2019t have the time to interact more. Does it mean being free to always be on social media means it\u2019s good? No. We are a small nation lacking natural resources in fact without our economic muscle we would have to become slaves or perhaps go Malaysia and work. Do note we lack the depth of land, oil, human. Yes the stress is high in Singapore but it\u2019s how it\u2019s meant to be so that we are relevant. I am sorry to say there are many ideals and principles but all these are borne from the fact that each of these people lived in a comfortable society and country without much hardship. In the older days people slog their guts off to survive. What you have now did not come by easily the things you take for granted like public transport, current medical infrastructure the security and safety that you feel when you go home are not to be taken for granted. If and when one day our current government really gets voted out the implications is fast and wide. As a accountant I can say is this stocks, investments will trickle to nil unless the new government can perform better but even so it requires trust, records and the ability to engage global leaders. Our opposition lacks that ability and people may argue they were never given the chance to take that mantle but I would say if given and failed who would allow us second chance? The countries in our immediate region possess vast land/ infrastructure/ resources no matter how much their government fuck it up they can easily and will be capable to always find funds for example Malaysia they can bail out by selling palm oil and exports of raw goods in which we cannot. \n\nWe have no bail out plan. Our only plan is to be the best or aim to be one of the best consistently. The government has set Singapore up to become a tax haven and a international arbitration center and on top of that a human resource/ finance /legal and accounting powerhouse. We are already a service economy in which we provide professional guidance and services to MNC and other conglomerates. These did not come by easily it comes through trust and foundations built over the decades of our independence. It is easy to say that the government sucks and cost of living is rising and the government is a cold hearted money sucking demon but to what end will government subsidy be used to offset all these? We can do it but it will jeopardise our National security and covid19 has proven that on good times savings helped us during a rainy day. We shelled enough dough to keep us relatively all good. We did not have to surrender like some Malaysians had unfortunately experienced. \n\nIf there is one thing to point out that Singaporeans had failed it is this if you observe foreigners did not have the power it is simply them helping each other and staying extremely United which overpowered some of you and caused u happiness . We Singaporeans despite being kind but cold looking we failed to stay United in workplace. Singaporeans always pick on Singaporeans and that causes workplace disintegration. If you realise and complain about having a bunch of pinoys and india Ceca it is simply them helping their countryman. \n\nIt is sad that we Singaporeans do not stay United to help each other out in workplace. if we do we wouldn\u2019t be so divided and get replaced in some industries by foreigners. \n\nIn all upgrading of oneself is the only way to live the way you want to be else do not be unhappy that your living \u201csun par\u201d life because not everyone can be a prince. By utilising the 8th wonder of the world and start investing at age 25 lump sum 10k with 500$ monthly for 15 years that sum would become a huge one when your 40. All these are achievable but not everyone earn a decent wage above 3.2k. Imo 3.2k is a decent wage for a degree holder in fact degree salary starts from the range of 2.6k to 6k in cs. So it really is luck, education, entrepreneurship spirit and other factors. Don\u2019t pursue needless material wants and perhaps you will realise it\u2019s more lovable than elsewhere. Of course the vast lands of Canada, Australia, USA, China and countries within Europe are the envy of the world but as the saying goes the grass is always greener on the other side. \n\nIt\u2019s just how we are as Singaporeans. we are having it good and given the tools and knowledge to build our nest eggs. Take it and build it. If the government was bad I don\u2019t think us being so small would still be prosperous right now and most of us would be jobless. The job support scheme although limited is a envy of the world you think money come down from the sky? No it don\u2019t it\u2019s through prudent planning and savings. The incumbent government could jolly well do what the people wanted by offsetting this and that free this and that but to what extent? Surely it will garner widespread support but it will one day become UK and Greece. socialism does no benefit other than ruining a country. Citizens will simply become complacent and when we become complacent our lunch will permanently be eaten by someone else. \n\nTo all those complaining about your lunch being eaten why not take this time and upgrade yourself and change a lower wage for a living first and bid your time to bounce back up. No one owe you a living and the government surely don\u2019t owe you a salary. Your great here than anywhere else. If your selfish well socialism is good and the collective good of society and future generations will pay for this generation and that is what happened to Uk and Greece.  The next being USA."

We have an aggressive expansionist China on the one hand, rising education levels and infrastructure / development in many ASEAN nations, that put them in direct competition with us, and extremely high internal cost structure in comparison with our direct competitors on the other. That coupled with a lack of willingness to move away from being a tax haven for the rich towards building a more entrepreneurial society (with lower costs and better social safety nets) will put us in a very difficult position in the coming decades. We are already seeing large swathes of work being outsourced around the region - and large numbers of foreigners working here only because we are the regional hub. We\u2019re going to see rough waters coming before long. \n\nThe stability in Singapore is based on the current status quo. Those in the majority would experience it very differently. I see it as a diminishing value in my culture/values, in favour of the normal \u201cmajority\u201d culture and values. Traits such as my darker skin end curly hair are considered ugly / defective. By my name alone I am tagged with a number of stereotypes that I have to work to counter. All the while smiling. This wasn\u2019t so bad overseas since it was not my home. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for family and friends here and my trapped CPF monies - plus an unfavourable skill set that makes it harder to migrate to a \u201cgood\u201d country like New Zealand - I would have left long ago."

It was his parents who caned him not the teacher?\n\nYes I acknowledge that the education system is a challenging one, but the ones causing unnecessary stress are the parents. Parents are the one punishing their kids for not getting As and parents are the ones sending their kids for additional tuition. Quite frankly in Singapore, I personally know of many who didn\u2019t do well academically in school but are still doing well in the working life. So its not to say that not getting straight As in PSLE is the end of the world. Instead of making the exams easier, perhaps educate parents to teach their kids that failing exams does not equal to failing in life. \n\nSpeaking as a Singaporean kid that grew up getting scolded for not scoring full marks."

If Singapore is not for you, then pack up and leave, not that being a migrant is any easier. If migrating is not your preferred choice, then it is learning to cope with the horridness of things the way they are.\n\nI'm not pessimistic but realistic. The root of the problem is not merely some lack of political will, but inherent selfishness, greed and injustice in a ever-more capitalistic world. In some nations, poverty and violence is a problem. In others, stress, competition and inequality is the issue. Every nation gets the government it deserves. Every nation has the right to stage a revolution, oppose, object. The fact that we don't means the majority is satisfied with the status quo.\n\nWhen I learnt to accept that the future very much depends on me choices and actions, I feel less saddened by what is going all around. We can only do the best we can, and hope to also have the capacity to do the little to make things a bit better for those around us. Be the change that you need in society. That's really all we can try to do"

Sure you say singapore is based on meritocracy, but I would argue the outlier who have had access to things /privilege since young, and that would really propel their life forward (having good education etc) which alot is actually based on having money.( Look at Joseph schooling, if his family wasnt rich, do you honestly think he would have the chance to train under the coach he wanted?) \nI am not saying poor people cannot succeed, it just takes alot more effort to find the resources . And as long as the income gap is getting bigger and bigger. It will get harder and harder... Showing one or two rag to riches story here and there won't change my mind."

Though with that being said, I am not blind to the areas that the country can improve, but I\u2019m either not as affected (due to the privilege) or it hasn\u2019t affected me yet (different life stage for example) but here\u2019s a list of key improvement areas:\n\n1. Housing is expensive and inaccessible - even HDBs are getting quite expensive and the sizes are getting smaller. We can say it\u2019s the nature of being in a small country with scarce land, however there\u2019s still a lot that could be done to make housing more affordable and keep real estate from becoming an investment vehicle but rather a place to live and raise a family.\n\n2. Education system is still very much stuck in the industrial revolution era - too stressful, too regimented, too limiting, too much value placed on STEM and not enough on the arts and the creative fields. This is one area that gives me pause as I am looking to start having kids here. I wish that kids get to be kids more here rather than spending time shuttled between school and enrichment classes.\n\n3. Better treatment and rights for migrant workers and domestic helpers - don\u2019t think I need to go into details here.\n\n4. Although health care is world class, the country\u2019s handling, support, and stigma around mental health seems to still be behind other developed countries.\n\n5. For a country that is as rich and as wealthy as Singapore, social support for the elderly and those who are less privileged could be much improved.\n\n6. Progressiveness around LGBTQ is certainly lacking. Without official recognition, those in this community is unable to adopt, unable to get public housing, etc.\n\n7. Edit: How can I forget - Raising children is quite expensive\u2026\n\nI might be able to think of more later, but these are what that comes to mind at the moment."

But that would cost me at least 120k in today\u2019s money.\n\nIf our median salaries have increased 4x since then, then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue but our median salaries have barely doubled.\n\nTo those who argue that the salaries have kept pace with inflation. The truth is that we have had an aging population for the longest time. Meaning that each year, the average years of experience goes up. Meaning that if you\u2019re coming in as a person with 0 experience, your starting salary would have much less purchasing power than someone in your position 5-10 years ago"

Your parents would be the upper class of that period to earn over a thousand.\n\nAnd you try bringing up 1940s?

Both are fine.\n\nThe way most locals use public transport is we mainly use both buses and trains in a single trip, as it connects us to the entire island even to where the train doesnt go. And for the most part, the fare of the buses and train rides are combined and you pay for the distance you travelled in a single trip. Example from your residence you take a bus ride to the nearest train station then to your destination's nearest train station, and then take another bus ride to your destination, it counts as a single trip.\n\nAlso, welcome to Singapore! Hope you enjoy your stay here."

It depends on which station you\u2019re at. For most stations I think the transfer will be within the station itself. You may need to walk some distance or go up / down a floor. Following the crowd and the signs will help you find your way. One or two transfer stations need you to actually exit (scan your card at the gantry) first."

Most credit cards work as an EZ Link card and don't require top-ups. \n\nTopping up can be a huge pain if I'm stuck at a bus stop without an MRT station or a place where I can top up. Using a credit card means that I can just pay at the end of the month along with the other expenses that I've incurred on the card. My card gives me miles as well for transport spending including MRT spending. \n\nPre-Covid, I was spending close to $180 a month on MRT fares, so it's nice to get miles for that."

We don\u2019t count as \u2018students\u2019 and instead we pay adult fares for normal trips, though there exists a university concession card which gives you unlimited rides on bus, mrt or both at a cost of between 55-90.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re overstating the need for Mandarin lmao. Besides, cai fan isn\u2019t the only cheap food option if you search around. You should also allow for a bigger food budget (~500) since $5 meals don\u2019t exist everywhere.  \n\nRent budget is fine I think (maybe push it to 800 to be safe). I\u2019d suggest you stay in Paya Lebar/Dakota since they\u2019re on the Circle Line, same as Bras Basah (since from your posts you\u2019ll be going to SMU?). They\u2019re old but decent neighbourhoods with cheap food and the National Stadium/East Coast Park is not too far away if you want to just have a chill walk outside.\n\nPhone budget is ok. Might wanna increase your \u2018others\u2019 budget just in case? No need if you\u2019re confident about your spending.\n\nSo yeah the final budget comes up to 500+800+90+20+90=1500. Obviously you can go even lower than your own budget or higher than mine, but I think mine accounts for more unplanned stuff + better quality of life (necessary to counteract uni stress) so you could consider it."

Uni student has concession for mrt only, which is around $55. Assuming each trip costs $2, back and forth is $4, you just need to 'go out/school' for around 16 days to breakeven. So even on the weekends, if you go out, just take the mrt to your closest destination and walk wherever you need to go. This works out quite well for me and save a lot of momey (+ exercise too)\n\nIt can also be good since youre an international student to be exploring Sg easily on the mrt. \n\nSeeing that you are a woman, do avoid staying near places around Geylang area if you can. Not that it is super unsafe, but generally at night it could get a bit shady. This extends to as far as Eunos area. This comment could be a bit controversial but just my opinion. \n\nIn terms of food option, $5 per meal is decent for day to day - try to buy from hawker and food court to save money. U can save on breakfast money by buying a large loaf of gardenia bread and make it fancy by buying sliced ham. This can make breakfast cost to around $1 per day or so. \n\nOne thing to note is going out/entertainment on the weekend. This can easily get very expensive. A meal in a cheap restaurant will cost easily $15 upwards. And a movie on the weekend is around $10 iirc. So do factor those in as well."

If you are going to use WiFi most of the time at home or in school, then you can actually cut that $20 down even further by going for the $10 for 6Gb plan. They have rollover data for 2 cycles so if you are not a heavy user, you can have double the data in the next month.\n\nIf you find that its too low, then try to wait for Giga's pop-up promos which happens usually during special events or holidays, then upgrade to get the $18 for 50Gb plan. \n\nHowever, that also depends on where you are staying cos Giga is under Starhub and their coverage is rather spotty in some areas like where I stay.. I get like only 1 bar in my house and 2 bars if I move close to the window. Their internet speeds are pretty good though.\n\nThe other alternative is TPG Mobile that offers $10 for 50Gb but I've no experience with them and I do have some concerns about their mobile coverage in Singapore. They have their own network. \n\nIn any case, these SIM-only plans have no contract, so you are free to switch after a month or so.. do read the fine prints in case there is a clause for early termination.\n\nFinally, DO NOT buy pre-paid cards... they are a complete rip-off IMO.\n\nOn transport, its really not too expensive to move around here. If you stay in the heartlands, the rent will probably be cheaper too.\n\nHope the above helps!"

Furthermore, SG's pretty small and commuting wouldn't be that long.\n\nFood: I think $5 per meal is pretty okay for hawker food but that means no drinks, nice dinner or meals in the city. You'll have to live on a strict diet. As for pricing, most hawkers have a large menu on their signboard or pasted on their stall. If you were to stay in the hearlands, it can be about $3-4 per meal at hawker centres.\n\nPublic transportation: there are no discount fees for anyone after high school so you should assume paying for adult fares. Fares are about $2 per trip (or slightly less). To and fro school would be $4 and for 31 days in a month, it would be $124. You can save by taking the MRT before 7:45 am where there is a $0.50 discount. \n\nPhone: $20 is possible. You can try Gomo which uses the infrastructure of the largest telco operator (Singtel). Have been using it for some time and so far there was no issue with receptions or any other issues. I've not manage to hit the 20GB (they sometimes give bonus data) mainly bcos work/study from home and availability of wifi everywhere around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can drop me a message if need be!"

You can see how far each of the unit from the MRT. rule of thumb - 600-800m from mrt means you can usually still walk to the MRT. so it's very convenient\n\nYou can take a look here and see based on the picture which one you like, and you can contact the agent directly. usually that's how i do it since i'm also a foreigner and usually that's how I do it   \n\n\nhope this helps!"

Every condo has different offerings but you\u2019d get a smaller living space for the same amount you pay in rent for a hdb. The other housing options are usually landed properties. The price range for that varies drastically.\n\nIn general the options you should take note is the square footage of a place and the number of rooms available. For 2 people I would suggest something above 600sqft. The age of the place and the location affects the pricing. Closer you are to the the city, the higher the rent. I did a quick check on PropertyGuru.com.Sg and there are a few options within the 3-3.4K range.\n\nI\u2019m no Real Estate agent. Just sharing what I know. Hope that helps."

                "comment": "For your budget, I would advise:\n\n1. Look for a condo - 2 room, 1 or 2 baths. Filter by your maximum budget & browse to see which ones you like.\n\n2. If you can, go for a brand new condo. The listing will say either \"brand new\", \"just TOP\" or \"recently TOP\". TOP means temporary occupation permit and it means the developer just handed over keys to owners. New condos are usually in better condition and the aircon & appliances are usually still under warranty so it's free to fix. \n\n3. Here's a map of the Singapore subway (called MRT in Singapore): https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/map/train.html\n\n4. If you work near one-north, the nearest subway station is One-North MRT (on Circle yellow line). I would suggest looking for condos that are either walking distance to stations on Circle (yellow) line or the East-West (green) line. \n\nThe following areas are quite central, close to your work, have lots of expats living there and close to restaurants & amenities - but can be abit pricey:\n- Bukit Timah / Botanic Gardens\n- Holland Village\n- Tiong Bahru \n- Outram Park \n- Tanjong Pagar\n- Chinatown / Telok Ayer \n\nYou can also choose to live closer to your workplace or in other less central areas, and commute on weekends to go out or visit downtown Singapore. It's very doable as public transport is good here. \n\nBear in mind Singapore is very small so as long as your condo is walking distance to an MRT station, it's fairly easy to commute anywhere.\n\n5. Things to note when renting here:\n- Pay 1 months' security deposit when you sign Letter of Intent (LOI).\n-  Pay first months' rent when you sign tenancy contract. \n- Check if rent includes WiFi, utilities and aircon servicing. Usually excluded but worth asking.  \n- Check if fully or partially furnished. Partial furnished means appliances and some basic furniture only. \n- Check facilities in your condo. Some condos have \"full service\" facilities and others have only a few basic facilities. \n- As you are foreigners, make sure your LOI & tenancy contract includes a diplomatic clause that allows you to break your lease if you have to return home early. Usually, only given for 2 year leases. For 1 year lease, typically landlord won't give this. \n- Agent commission is usually paid by landlord, not tenant. I would skip listings / agents who ask tenant to bear part of the commission. \n- Stamp duty is usually paid by tenant. \n- Most condos don't allow moving in on weekends. Bear that in mind when negotiating your lease start date. \n- Contact the condo management office to check if you need to submit any forms / pay deposits when moving in. Ask about any other restrictions or approvals required before moving in. \n\nHope this helps! Any further queries, please feel free to ask."

Might have to stretch to 4k ish for that? There are HDB estates nearby in commonwealth, ghim moh, Holland Village, or Dover that will fit your budget.\n\nThat's more or less the decision making process because the price can vary greatly depending for apartments of the same size depending on whether the are located, and what kind of apartment (luxurious condo vs public housing)."

Do note that when you successfully rent a place, you\u2019ll need to pay a stamping duty fee.  The fee is based on the duration and monthly rent.\n\nIn return, you\u2019ll get a stamp duty cert.  If you need help paying for it, you can ask the agent to assist you at no additional cost.  Just remember to reimburse them once they\u2019ve sent you the stamp duty cert.\n\nHope you find your home soon!!"

The same amount of space you could get for 3k would cost you around 5-6k for a condo (which has security, gym, pool). Your neighbors are more likely to be locals than fellow expats, if you're interested in integrating with the local community.\n\nFor example: https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/23629324 - 2.5k/mth for 870 sqft in the area you want. You'd probably need to get your own furniture, but that's cheap and easy from ikea.\n\nSome other examples of what you might want to look for in a hdb - recently renovated, which floor it is on, accessibility by public transport.\n\nhttps://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/23644077\n\nhttps://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/23631133\n\nGood luck!"

(got lots of people i know using it and say its pretty good).  \n\n\nif you're getting a local sim card. get a local non contract like gomo or grid. (I've bounced from gomo to grid to gomo based on promotions. current like $24/50gb of data per month)  \n\nnot sure if non citizens can get it .  \nbest reception generally is singtel + singtel mvno (like grid and gomo)\n\nliterally you have to ask your colleagues around tuas viz reception for other telcos. (eg: the newest telco's in the market isn't up to standard yet, having no reception in building basements or mrt lines)."

Similar to landed areas in sg area. No real security except a few cctv around the lamp posts. \n\nThe only place that really has security in sg for residentials are condos, which frankly does not much for enforcement as well. They are there to create that facade of security than actually enforcing it.

The former have school uniforms while the latter (save for ITE) do not. It would be hard to differentiate outsiders from students in the latter, hence no point\n\n2. While you may argue that ITE/poly students are the same age as jc students and hence the same level of protection should be offered, then my answer is, not really. JCs only admit students fresh out of O\u2019lvls (17-18 yr olds). ITE and polytechnics, in addition to the aforementioned group, also admits working adults who wish to upgrade themselves. And again, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to differentiate a working adult from an intruder. Hence, not practical. \n\nHope this offers some insights as to why things are done the way they are.

Correct me if I'm wrong, from what I understand, normally police officers need a warrant to investigate your possessions. If they don't have have a warrant, you should be able to reject. If the officers are acting outside of their authority(I hope not), you might not be the first victim and might not be the last. If its nothing, at least you have some clarification and hopefully some closure."

But at this point, it would likely be taken as you gave it willingly. \n\nI'm not local but cops back in Canada learn how to twist the law to aid them in investigation. They won't take the phone from you, they'll convince you to hand it over freely. \n\nI had a massive party at my place when I was young . A friend answered the door, it was the cops.  They asked for me while waiting outside. When I got to the door they confirmed it was my place then told me I had to go with them. I figure I did nothing wrong so I listened. After I got a few feet from my door they changed their mind and told me to go back inside. At the time I thought it was weird that I could literally feel him stepping on my heels as I walked in. Learned later that cops can't enter private property without a warrant or permission from a resident. Following me in is considered permission. So getting me to step out was tricking me to let them follow me back in. \n\nRemember this was Canada not Singapore. But learning local rules is a great way to protect yourself in legal situations. Secondly. In Canada you can film the interaction. Once filming ask them to tell you if you are being asked to hand over the phone or forced by law.  Give me your phone is still a request. Language is everything in law \n\nI'm surprised to see this kind of action randomly in Singapore. Cops seem so chill here. But I also think sometimes it's easier to comply.  Always good to get a police officers badge number in a situation like this. If you think you are profiled by the way you look, dress, race, you might want to start reading more of your rights. \n\nI use to get stopped a lot when I was young. Shaggy hair, baggy clothes. I started dressing up when I went to the airport and I stopped getting \"randomly searched\"."

                "comment": "Actually, for precision, you generally do have the right to silence and the privilege against self incrimination in Singapore. The right to silence and privilege against self incrimination is captured in Section 22(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010?ProvIds=P1IV-#pr22-). See also: Sections 231(m) CPC and S291 CPC for other stages of the criminal procedure. The right of silence, however, does not apply in corruption charges. \n\nOf course, in certain situations, choosing to exercise your right to silence could result in the courts drawing an adverse inference (if you are eventually charged for a crime and brought before the courts). See Section 261 CPC (https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010?ProvIds=P1XIV-#pr261-). This is because when questioned and accused of a crime, if you are innocent, you are generally expected to say something in your defence. That said, the courts are unlikely to convict someone based purely on an adverse inference. The prosecution has to prove your supposed guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - a high standard that sole reliance on an adverse inference is unlikely to meet. The right of silence (and possible adverse inference drawn) is also well established in case law but reference to statute for my explanation here should be sufficient. \n\nOf course, when in doubt, please contact your lawyer, who will be better placed to advise you. On that note, as a point of interest, according to s9(3) of the Singapore Constitution, you do have the constitutional right to be defended by a lawyer. https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P1IV-#pr9-"

Education wise, it was very difficult, I had to self study many things due to not being able to attend the whole syllabus and work was another obstacle. The mindset of most people I have met is \u201ccannot see means there is, no pain\u201d which as we both know is ridiculous. \n\nPertaining specifically to SG Context, on bad pain days I use the disability sticker so I can get a seat on the MRT/bus. It took a while to feel comfortable using it, but I know I have to some days. I\u2019ve been chided for sitting down without the sticker many times and it feels awful :( - you can get it from the MRT station/ interchange control office with your diagnosis letter. \n\nFortunately I haven\u2019t been discriminated in the workforce, but I know people who have been. I have never had anyone turn me down due to my condition, important to note that I work as a healthcare provider. I work an average of 10 hours a day, taking breaks whenever I need. Very grateful to have an understanding and empathetic employer. \n\nAs someone who has lived with chronic pain for over 10 years, it truly does get easier. You begin to get used to it, learn how your body adapts to different treatments and medications. You\u2019re most definitely not alone in this, there are support groups on FB which I recommend joining even if you\u2019re a silent member. Just because of your diagnosis it doesn\u2019t mean your life will drastically change. You can still live a very fulfilling life regardless, even if others can carry a full plate while we carry a small spoon."

It is unlikely that you\u2019ll be more than 10 minutes walk from a bus stop, or wait more than 20 minutes for the bus.\n\nThe laws which are enforced are enforced very hard.

It is also very humid, so don\u2019t bring thick everyday clothes. But we have some indoor places with extremely cold air conditioning, so sometimes a jacket is helpful.\n\nMost people are focused on their own activities and might not be very open to talking to strangers.

If further than that you sweat like crazy (unless your walk is indoors)\n- each MRT station is roughly 3-4 min apart.  So a 5 station trip would be 12-15 min\n- rent is high in CBD and drops of pretty quickly.  Go far out and you can get a lot for the same as a tiny apartment in CBD\n- if you think you\u2019ll be flying a lot (covid, haha) it can help to be on the east side versus west side.\n- I found choosing somewhere close to amenities like groceries, restaurants, hawker centers is smart.  You don\u2019t spend a lot of time walking or taking transit to run errands\n- lot of expats near CBD and north up to Orchard and Novena. Go really far out and there won\u2019t be many at all."

                "comment": "Hey there :) welcome to Singapore ! Ive been thinking about relocating for work myself recently so I get where your questions are coming from. Let me try to answer some of your Q, as a local! \n\n1) On the best area to live \n\nFirst question: What are your \u201cmust haves\u201d for your new home location ? Singapore is extremely safe (compared to anywhere else in the world), there\u2019s no \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cdangerous\u201d neighborhoods to avoid. The major consideration for most locals when choosing a place here is therefore CONVENIENCE, because the #1 everyday danger is probably being drenched in sweat before you reach your destination. That\u2019s why everyone else in this thread\u2019s talking about being walking distance to the MRT or LRT. \n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t plan to take the public transport and is ok with paying for a Grab (the local alternative to Uber) most days, feel free to ignore the above advice. FYI for a benchmark: I know a few expat friends who Grab everywhere, but locally everyone pretty much move around Singapore via our crazy efficient MRT. It\u2019s way more affordable, and there are few places you can\u2019t get to by MRT. The hip / expat-heavy areas tend to be in areas where MRT isn\u2019t too near, but it\u2019s certainly walkable distance still. \n\nOther than transport, next consideration is neighborhood vibe. What kind of lifestyle are you looking to ? Someone mentioned CBD area/Orchard/ Novena, yes those are the typical expat-concentrated areas. They are literally in the centre of town too. Locals generally live further out from town: if you look at the MRT map, about every station down to the last stop in the line is a residential area. To give you perspective of why, it\u2019s because every neighborhood thrives with its own big malls, theatres, and parks. For example, on the NEL (purple line) of the MRT, the last 2 stations (Punggol / Sengkang ) are highly populated with their own theatres / swimming complexes and waterfront parks. You\u2019ll rarely find expats there though, but it\u2019s an option, and rentals will be way cheaper too :) btw, it\u2019ll take you just 20minutes from these neighborhoods to get to central town via MRT, so really, it isn\u2019t that far. \n\nYou mentioned you\u2019d like to meet new younger people in SG: I\u2019m sorry but neighborhoods won\u2019t influence that much. People here are generally more shy and we\u2019re usually just trying to get to our destination so you won\u2019t find yourself striking up a conversation with strangers anytime here, realistically speaking. I\u2019d think the way to make friends here is through a shared activity le experience - you join a hobby group or hold dinner parties / have flatmates. Otherwise, there\u2019s apps like Bumble that has a friends finding mode! A tip on making conversation with locals: generally speaking it never goes wrong to talk about food, Singaporeans are actually pretty welcoming people, we might seem shy or closed off at first but please, ask, and we will be more happy to show you around :) we\u2019re pretty proud of our diverse food culture. \n\n2) On customs in Singapore \nI can\u2019t really think of any customs we have specifically, because I don\u2019t know what is considered acceptable / rude to you as well :) I\u2019d say you\u2019ll have to be observant to pick up the unspoken rules, but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re pretty laid back and always embrace curiosity from non locals :) my only tip for you here is, don\u2019t be afraid to speak up, if you ask, 70% of the time you\u2019ll be surprised that people are more than happy to help you out / show you around! \n\nHope this helps, let me know if you have any more specific questions and I\u2019ll be glad to try and answer them. Having moved cities myself and prepping for my next move, I know this unfamiliarity at the start can be a little daunting, so I\u2019ll try my best to help you navigate as I can."

We are a racially-diverse country, so I dont think u will find an issue living here. \n\nPS: Its very humid, so dont bring thick clothes.\n\nPPS: Our culture is to complain on everything, just take it lightly or you can join in the fun and complain with us! :)"

In certain areas there are also middle eastern food being prominent as well. Not too sure about African cuisines as I dont see them around in malls. So that is something to look forward to if you are up to try different food. \n\nHawker is the most common for locals and this is where you can get authentic food that is not made fancily for the aesthetics. One big thing is that people might leave their items unattended on the seats (e.g. name cards or packets of tissue papers), it is an informal reservation of seats. So please do not sit there. Nor use the items. \n\nYounger people will address older folks (stall owners and the likes) with uncle or auntie colloqually in day to day interaction when buying food from hawker of local shops. They are not familial ties. It is just an informal speech of addressing someone.\n\nOverall Sg doesnt have much unspoken cultural rules. Dont break the law is generally a good rule to follow and people will appreciate that."

Generally we aren\u2019t usually the type that will smile at strangers and holler a \u201chello\u201d or approach non-locals for a friendly conversation. We are not very loud nor boisterous either and prefer to mind our own business. \n\nI think quite a few people have posted that laws are followed quite strictly so, yes please respect the laws and general etiquette here. There have been few instances of foreigners in the spotlight / news for being aggressive to others while cycling, or even jogging so\u2026 please don\u2019t do that. \n\nCOVID rules have to be strictly followed! The authorities will not bend the rules if you get caught at gatherings more than the permitted number of people. Even on offshore islands! Don\u2019t risk losing your job and being sent home because of that. \n\nHaving said, I do hope you enjoy your time here in Singapore."

It\u2019ll come to you once you\u2019ve been here long enough. \n\nWe\u2019re very asian so we basically respect elders, try not to speak over them and voice questions politely. Basically just be polite to almost everyone you meet and you\u2019ll do just fine. \n\nMMA gyms and centres are mostly located in the central areas of Singapore. (Vicinity of City hall mrt, central business district which we call CBD) \n\nWhere to live...hard to answer as that qn will need answers from you. Where is your job located at? What amenities are important to you? Is a mall or the beach more important? Do you mind travelling at least an hour by public transport daily? That sort of thing. Costs will come into play also, so you need to answer all that too. \n\nYour workplace will be where you meet most of the people in your time here in sg. Unless you\u2019re a friendly guy and like to actively go around the neighbourhood randomly talking to people. Your neighbours would be a good place to start if you like. Bring some food(a small dish or a small packed meal to share with them, fried chicken wings for example) , smile and be polite. Chat them up a bit at a reasonable hour. \n\nIf someone decides to stir trouble with you, dont fight back until they throw the first punch. That way you can defend yourself reasonably and avoid the police. Of course dont beat the guy until hes a bleeding pulp an inch from death. The police will arrest you for excessive force. \n\nMost laws here are quite strictly followed. Dont eat on trains and buses. Dont spill sodas there either. Jaywalking is not accepted but generally they\u2019ll close an eye if its \u201csafe\u201d when you do it. No one here carries guns except for the cops and military. Knives are very rare too. So you\u2019re relatively safe. \n\nYou can always ask your colleagues to bring you out to some night spots and watering holes to drink and chat. Just dont wxpect people to suddenly come up to you to start a convo. It happens, but very rarely here in sg where the most common mindset is \u201cmind your own business\u201d \n\nAs to qhat makes you happy here...some nice nature places to wander around can be easily googled. Museums are free(some, not all). Theatre is available though you might want to check whos performing before going. Classical music is there too if you like. Movie theatres are almost everywhere in sg so thats not really an issue. \n\nGet used to cooking at home. Or eating at a hawker centre if budget is a constraint. Groceries are easily obtained, pricing at various supermarkets can be easily checked and scaled for your preference via google. \n\nAnd dont be afraid to ask if you\u2019re not sure of something. Many people will be willing to give you the benefit of the doubt since you\u2019re a young guy coming to live and work here from overseas. No one will laugh at you for asking cultural and societal qns, dont worry. And...few people here speak really good english. We speak a pidgin version of it very commonly. Its called singlish. It takes some getting used to. If you\u2019re not sure what the person means when they say it, just check with them. \n\nMost of us will be rushing around, singapore is famous for the rat race. More money. Higher promotion. Easier life, etc. So it\u2019ll definitely take some getting used to. Be sure to protext yourself against backstabbing and backbiting at work! \n\nReligion is not really a touchy issue if you\u2019re curious about it, just ask. No one will be upset at your qn what their religion is...unless you\u2019re being insulting about it. We have a tendency to make jokes about something with knives hidden in the joke. It takes some getting used to, to be able to identify when its happening. \n\nAll in all? Good luck and have a fun time. The police are fair...or as fair as can be. Dont be afraid to call on them if you\u2019ve suffered an injustice. You can also go there to ask for advice like what should you do if you want to pursue some legal action. They\u2019re not lawyers, but they should be able to help you with domestic disputes and point you in the right direction with financial and/or job-related disputes."

She already knows this and it barely ever works. Try an indirect approach like asking her what book she is reading or what she\u2019s listening to. Indirect approaches are far less stressful for women. From there just talk like a normal human about interesting things and keep a conversation going for a bit. Then you can ask for her number. Don\u2019t ask for a number so you can \u201cgo for drinks\u201d, make it relevant to your indirect approach. So if it was about books ask her for her number so you two can talk about a book you\u2019re about to finish (e.g.)\n\nI\u2019m just a normal looking guy but if I present myself well + wear a good perfume it works wonders. I\u2019ve had many success stories AND many failures. So it helps if you just don\u2019t care when you get rejected. Women have the right to turn you down so just accept it if it happens and don\u2019t give yourself a hard time trust. It\u2019s happens to every Man."

Probably depends on where exactly you are looking at, but do bear in mind potential noise/dust/congestion issues. \n\nFarrer Park is ok if you are not in the two blocks north and south of the MRT. I.e. the parts bounded by Tessensohn Road, Serangoon Road, Race Course Road and Kitchener Road). For example I think the condo City Square Residences is quite popular with expats. \n\nSt Francis is the one at Upper Bukit Timah Road? How about considering the neighbourhood at Newton instead. Newton MRT is an interchange for the Downtown blue line (St Francis) and the NorthSouth yellow line (San Yu). By road it's also nicely on the intersection of Bukit Timah Road (St Francis) and Thomson (San Yu). The only thing is I'm not sure if your budget can stretch to a 3BR in the area."

It\u2019s something you need to get used to traveling on the public transport system with a folding bike. Also, there are different types of folding bikes which would make it easier for you to travel around with, such as the trifold ones like brompton, 3sixty, pikes as compared to bifold ones like dahon, fnhon, camp, java etc. However the trifold ones cost more. \n\nPersonally it would be easier to travel on trains as compared to bus as there\u2019s more space on trains. I would recommend getting a 14-inch that is small and lightweight for your 8-year old which he should be able to push it on his own. Alternatively, you can consider getting a bicycle bag for you to carry it instead while pushing your own."

I like planning route that ends at the beginning of mrt line so cfm have place to put. Cycle anywhere n end at marina bay for example.\nHas seen father n son 2 folding bikes going into bus on saturday evening. Father carried the bikes in via middle bus door just like wheelchair.\nEasiest bike to bring mrt is those china bikes with a triangle stand right under the seat. What we do is just fold mid frame once, no need to fold handlebar and push thru mrt. We have 16 and 20 inch. For brompton 3sixty style the cons is we have to keep an eye on it at all time due to expensive, so cannot just lock outside n go buy groceries or something, so really gotta plan route and pit stos properly.\nCarousell is your best bet for 3sixty, 900 to 1400. Make sure try and see if u comfortable in term of cycling position. We find 3sixty straight handle uncomfortable due to short arms and upgrade $50 to M bar."

The only person I know who imported a car from Europe is a millionaire architect. The Certificate of Entitlement (basically permit that allows you to own the car) is much more expensive than the car itself. Parking is expensive and will get even more so. There are many other expenses such as road tax, insurance, COE renewal etc etc. Drivers are also so rude on the roads (due to the high levels of stress here), I've met many who have a complete disregard for other's safety or just want to take out their anger on you. We're such a tiny country, we cant have everyone owning cars. Public transport is pretty good, taxi, grab, gojek are very reliable and affordable. Also, if your wife a highly skilled expat, she might likely get paid enough to afford the expensive rent in the city centre. So that cuts down on your transport time/expenses too."

It\u2019ll make your commute a lot easier as busses make a ridiculous amount of stops. You\u2019ll sometimes have two stops within 150m and then no traffic light to cross the street. Not great with a stroller. \nBut yeah, a lot easier in general since they allowed strollers on the busses. But don\u2019t expect people to help you get the stroller inside. No one will blink an eye. Therefor get a super light weight stroller for your commute."

And less annoying, because you won\u2019t need to search for parking constantly.

Grab rides and taxis are cheap and plentiful. I've done the calculations and it really is cheaper to take 2-3 taxi rides per day than pay for a car and all the associated expenses. \n\nThe only thing I haven't seen addressed in the comments are car seats. From a quick internet search, you can book a [Grab Family](https://i.imgur.com/IkKw2Z8.jpg) ride (at a higher rate) and they will provide a car seat or booster suitable for children above 1 year old. Taxis are not required to provide any child restraints beyond seat belts and regular Grab rides aren't supposed to accept children less than 1.35 meters tall. So, you will have to hold your baby in your arms or drag your own car seat with you while you shop, dine out, etc. I don't have young children, so I'm hoping someone with more experience can jump in to offer further insight."

                "comment": "Holland Village is the ideal neighbourhood for you as it meets every single criteria on your list. But there aren't many affordable condominiums built recently. You're looking at maybe 3M to 5M for a 3-bedder within walking distance of the MRT. If you're willing to consider something slightly older, I do see a unit (built 1997) going for 2.3M right now. So it is possible, but your options will be limited simply due to the small supply and the popularity of the neighbourhood. \n\nIt's easy to get groceries delivered (Amazon Fresh and Redmart amongst others), so if you remove the supermarket criterion, you can look into the developments around Farrer Park MRT especially d'Leedon. If you're ok with slightly older developments, that opens up significantly more possibilities in that neighborhood too. A budget of 2.2 to 2.6M should get you someplace comfortable.\n\nMoving westwards along the Circle Line will get you the Buona Vista, One North and Kent Ridge neighbourhoods all of which do not have many condominiums available within short walking distance of the respective MRT stations. They're mostly around at least 15 to 20 minutes walk away. At least you'd have no problems finding supermarkets and eateries around here.\n\nFurther west at Haw Par Villa MRT, you have a sizeable cluster of apartments (more if you are willing to walk up Pasir Panjang Hill) but you wouldn't have food and groceries nearby. Likewise for Pasir Panjang MRT. \n\nThere aren't (m)any residences at Labrador MRT at all.\n\nYou do have a few more options available at Telok Blangah MRT (like Skyline Residences) and Harbourfront MRT (Carribean and Corals at Keppel). A 3 bedder would cost you around 2.5 to 3.3M at these places. Of the two locations, Harbourfront is better as it's where Vivocity and Sentosa are of course. At Telok Blangah you have a more local vibe as you have HDB and hawker centres close by."

I\u2019d like you to look into Normanton park - it\u2019s an upcoming development bounded by a nature park and short distance away from Kent ridge mrt (which has a hospital & mall with decent enough options), and connectivity to Buona Vista station one stop away. It\u2019s access to Holland village without the bustle and almost living within a nature park. (The houses need to be checked in person to ensure the sound from the highway doesn\u2019t bother you - the unit I lived in before it got torn down had zero noise at that time). Your nearest wet market will be the gim moh one, not inconvenient.\n\nDollar wise, setting aside housing purchase, I\u2019d think you\u2019d need at least 250k to meet that lifestyle just barely. Sending your kids to public school, renting outside city and cooking at home drives costs down quite drastically. You will miss fresh food unless you pay top dollar almost all produce is shipped from overseas.\n\nThe one you asked about - I think your estimate for education is bang on. It\u2019s only if you can\u2019t get admission to public schools that it will higher"

Then you can come out ahead owning.\n\nFor example, the place a friend just rented is $3000 per month but $1.5M to buy.  Owning would run you $4-5k all in after putting a heft down payment down.  Add on top the ABSD and you\u2019d need to see strong appreciation to come out ahead (that said the same place would have rented for $4k per month before Covid, so closer to breakeven).\n\nThat said, rents can go up (so that\u2019s a risk - there is no rent control), but also the housing market is carefully managed by the SG gov\u2019t to ensure it doesn\u2019t get to overheated or starts crashing.  So it\u2019s not an entirely free market like Canada or the US.\n\nSo I\u2019d say if you were going to stay in SG for a long time, then yeah, buying could make sense.

With that being said, it would still be good to know beforehand what life quality is to be expected before the relocation. From the discussions here, it seems safe to budget a monthly expense of roughly $5k+ for rent, or $8k+ for a 25-year mortgage for a relatively comfortable life.\n\nAs far as I understand, apartment complexes entirely dedicated to rental and managed by a company are almost not existent in SG. And from what I saw on propertyguru, a lot of the listed properties there are currently tenanted. I think this adds a layer of insecurity if renting. But I totally agree that economically speaking, buying and selling within a few years most likely leads to money loss.

Your kid may end up going to school 30 min in the opposite direction of work.\n\nI had a foreigner friend who got her kid in her public school of choice but it took a couple years and lots of begging.\n\nEdit: And to add, PR is not like PR in Canada or the US.  You don\u2019t get it because you qualify, it\u2019s entirely at the discretion of the SG gov\u2019t and they don\u2019t advertise what they are looking for.  But generally it\u2019s contribution to Singapore\u2019s advancement through either: economic development, academics/research, international acclaim (say star athlete), and population increase (making babies who grow up to me SG citizens).

Get an agent to do all the work for you and guide you through the process. Many people say you don\u2019t need an agent, however as an ex pat, and with a company providing a relocation bonus, I\u2019d say it was money well spent.\n\nAnd just again on the furniture and what to bring side of things, just bring clothes and some small momentos. Leave everything else back home or in storage. You can get everything you need here with IKEA for homewares and Amazon for literally anything haha :) \n\nGood luck with the move, I take it you have all the approvals to enter etc and hope quarantine goes quickly"

Usually covers souse and children as well. \n\nTakeaways- for one person a steak, curry, pizza etc usually between $20-30 a time\n\nGroceries for 2- really depends what you eat. I probably stop off at the supermarket twice a week and spend about $75 a time. Beer, bacon, sausages, cheese, hand etc are quite expensive and usually start around $10 each, beer starts at about $15/4 pack, bottle of cheap wine starts around $25\n\nGym memberships - in the city prob closer to $100 month, out of town about $60 month\n\nTaxis- depend on time of day, if your lucky a 5 min ride not peak hour could be $8, a 15 min ride during peak times could be $30+ \n\nMRT/bus- depends how far but never usually more than $2\n\nSide note: Marina Bay and Orchard are overrated. If you\u2019re willing to go 15 min drive out of the city on ECP/AYE in either direction you\u2019ll get twice the space or pay half the cost."

Groceries from cheap supermarkets like Sheng shiong can be around 300-400sgd per month but usually expats go to Cold Storage or Marketplace and it\u2019s much more expensive. A decent 3-4 room condo in downtown be around 4-5k sgd, car (mpv or suv) anywhere from 150k to 350k depending on brand, usually 3-5k sgd per month including insurance/taxes/petrol, also greatly depends on if new car or not. If using public transport, way way cheaper. \n\nUr budget of 16k is way more than enough to cover basic living expenses considering our median wage is around 4-5k, but if u wanna enjoy in Singapore it\u2019s a different story"

Previously she was on Singtel and we once incurred $30+ extra just because she forgot to switch off mobile data at home (she didn't know how it happened and how to check) \n\nShe's got an old iPhone 6s that doesn't work well with TPG and therefore needs to use a separate TPG app to make calls instead of the normal phone app so that took a while to sort out. I think as long as you get a reasonably new phone and good TPG coverage at home it's good for old people."

Adult bus fares are usually about $1.50 per trip and $2 for trains. Even income tax rates in Singapore are low. I guess Singapore is expensive compared to neighbouring cities?

International school fees are $2k+ per child which adds up quick\n\nRent you\u2019re looking at $3k plus for a three bedroom in the outskirts of town for a condo, around $2k for an HDB. Costs get progressively higher quite quickly and anything above 3 rooms becomes prohibitive quickly - think $6k plus. Some of the three bedrooms here are also not true three bedrooms such as my current place which is a glorified closet space. \n\nHealthcare is a big issue especially with a family in tow. For my wife and child, we pay $1,500 USD per quarter for decent coverage. The child has to be on my wife\u2019s policy in order to get continued coverage which means it\u2019s at higher rates than I\u2019d like. I\u2019m personally covered by my work policy which is only good enough for me to break one leg once with minimal recovery. Anything more than that and I\u2019m looking to fly to Australia for medical support lest I end up paying $100k for hospital fees. If you\u2019re any adequate coverage for yourself and your family, you may be looking at upwards of $10k USD a year in premiums, excluding excess which could be a few thousand each. \n\nFood wise it\u2019s a mixed bag. Local food and groceries are extremely cheap, non-local food and groceries are extremely expensive. Yes hawkers centres are cheaper but may also cause hell on your diet and health given it\u2019s heavy in dirty fats and oils, carbs with minimal vegetables that aren\u2019t drenched in oil and sauce. You\u2019ll eat cheaply but at the cost of your health most likely. Otherwise groceries for decent quality that\u2019s not local, you\u2019re paying an arm and a leg for example avocados from Fairprice - local mid tier grocery store - you can get 5 for $7 but 4 of them may only be good for throwing at cars. The alternative is going to an upscale grocer and paying $13 for 2. There\u2019s little in between. \n\nTransport costs are cheaper than most other countries although I find not as convenient so you may find yourself taking taxis a lot. Taxis are also cheaper than other countries but the cost still adds up over time. \n\nAny activities involving your kids that has a cost will be sky high. My wife takes our child to music class for kids at $50 a pop which is ridiculous. With that said, there\u2019s plenty of activities here for kids that aren\u2019t expensive - pool weather here 365 days a year so you can spend all afternoon there, lots of walking trails and nature, bike rides around the island for a one time cost etc. \n\nBest of luck"

You can spot them in nature reserves and parks.\n\nWhile domesticated chickens are typically brought here as a food source, [pets](https://www.clubpets.com.sg/all-you-need-to-know-about-rearing-chicken-in-singapore/) and an effective pest keeping measure. Eventually some of these chickens escape and abandoned.\n\nUnless they are neighbourhood chickens or have a coop where they can go home too.

Underground MRT stations, community centers, schools, basement of some HDB blocks, some HDB void decks (some of these are hardened to act as bomb shelters) etc.  Space is super expensive in Singapore so all these places serve dual purposes.  You won't see dedicated bomb shelters.\n\nI won't worry too much about this though.  The SCDF will let us know if and when necessary where to go.  Singapore takes its civil defense seriously.  After all, the last time Singapore was bombed was less than 60 years ago."

However, do note that not all attractions are included in the Fun Pass. Skyline and Luge that you are interested in are not part of the Fun Pass. \n\nYou can take the monorail from Vivo Level 3 (next to Food Republic) for around $4 iirc and it\u2019s payable by Ezlink card. Alternatively, you can walk in via the Sentosa Broadway and it\u2019s free. And inside the island, you can take the monorail as you like to various stations for free too. \n\nDo note that due to COVID, you might need to register and reserve a slot for those attractions.

Usually you return the same way you get in, via company transport. There is a public bus service but that is very infrequent. Strongly would not recommend walking.\n\n3. Once again depends on which company you are at. Some companies have their own canteen. Some have transport to the food centre on the island (Oasis). Most times people just drive there or drive out.\n\n4. Get ready to pay advance booking fees of $8 if you intend to have a taxi pick you up from inside the island. Oh and don't get stuck at the checkpoint and miss your company bus (you have to disembark and clear the checkpoint like customs lol but far less crowded and much simpler)."

Here\u2019s what I know:\n\n1. at least 20min depends on traffic, especially peak hour jam along AYE. Jurong island itself is very big, could take some time to reach your destination depending how far in it is.\n\n2. There are bus 715, 716, 718 going to different area of JI. Charges $2.50 each trip. They go to and from bus stop next to Westgate, you could google Jurong island bus.\n\n3. I only knew there\u2019s a public canteen at Sakra Oasis. There\u2019s a Starbucks and Indian restaurant next to it too.\n\n4. Public transport is a challenge in JI, frequency is every 30min and it doesn\u2019t cover 11am-4pm I think. Try not to be late and missed your company bus. There\u2019s no problem into JI with taxi because there\u2019s a taxi lane at gantry for them to change temporary pass. Coming out will be difficult if there\u2019s no taxi in JI, like after 3pm when very few people going in."

Not to mention u need to fork out some cash for the initial downpayments and instalments will be a long term commitment.\n\nThe question is 1. Can you afford to comfortably pay the downpayment plus instalments with your current income 2. Whether you think it is worth it to top up that difference to own a car instead of taking public transport. Pros include more convenience esp if you have young children and if you need to go to places with less than ideal public transport frequently. Cons are in some cases taking train may be faster than driving esp when you go to CBD or Orchard. You also tend to waste time when you have to send car in for servicing, washing, grooming on regular basis.\n\nIn any case since supporting a car will form a large part of recurring expenses do think thru properly."

A car is a depreciating asset and the budget to own one is not just the monthly installments, but also monthly parking fees, petrol costs, ERP, insurance, road tax, maintenance costs, etc.\n\nI need my car to transport goods daily that are otherwise too inconvenient and heavy to carry through the journey of a public transport.\n\nOn the brightside, it is very convenient for travelling esp to meet friends or to explore ulu places where public transport will never take you to."

Marketing options are limited. \n\nKH pro: a lot of amenities and cheap as it is a built up residential estate. Marketing options aplenty (Keat hong, Teck Whye etc) \nKH con: LRT is crap most people take bus. Cck is damn far from civilisation. Sometimes got chicken shit smell from the Lim Chu Kang farms (not often maybe 1-2 a year and after many years you\u2019ll get used to it). \n\nHonestly, it really comes down to what are your priorities (cost?

If you\u2019re buying to stay for long (at least 10-15 years) then TB is really a great estate in the Long run and everything about real estate is location, location, location. Although I\u2019d like to caution that cost and values are very different concepts. Only you can tell if 710k is worth paying. \n\nIf you have intention to resell soon (~5 years), you\u2019ll prob not see much appreciation for either. The KH unit is a new MOP flat and the appreciation has been priced in for a far-flung location. Would suggest u look for more."

If everyone alighting at the next stop can signal their intentions earlier and get in position, they can save precious seconds / minutes when the bus reaches the stop (as opposed to everyone scrambling to get out of their inaccessible seats at the last second)."

I think it definitely does exist, and here's one major reason:\n\nA lot of foreigners don't really make any effort to integrate with Singaporeans and local culture. They basically try and live their life in Singapore exactly how they lived it back home. As a result they never really fit in, and locals may also perceive them as having some sort of air of superiority in the case of westerners, or locals may perceive them as uncultured or primitive in the case of PRC Chinese, South Asians, etc.\n\nI came here 17 years ago with an open mind and a sense of adventure. My company didn't post me overseas - it was actually something I actively campaigned for. I was well-compensated, but not on any expat package or employment contract. I lived my first two years here in an HDB on Sims Drive in Geylang ($700 SGD/month for the whole flat!). I was single at the time and ate most of my meals at the coffee shops downstairs. I'm pretty sure I was their first Ang Moh regular, and I think they got a big kick out of it. Of course it's helpful sometimes that I can speak Chinese - that really helps break the ice sometimes."

For politicians it is a really easy target to get people worked up over. The SG government can be pretty touchy about criticism, protests etc., but even it wasn't that bothered when people protested about 'immigrant' bus drivers and the like... The thinking seems to be something like 'better that our citizens dislike foreigners than notice other things they might not like'... Compared to Singapore, some in other countries have a lot more to hide too...\n\nThis kind of petty antagonism to outsiders is common in many places. I'm thankful to be in a place like Singapore where it is rare."

Resources spent on them could have been spent on locals instead.\n\nTheir behaviour (the term \u201cChinese tourist\u201d is a thing shows something).\n\nWhile yes, we do depend on foreigners, our society still has quite a way to go when it comes to being inclusive.

There may also be some prejudice against caucasians (\u201cAng Mohs\u201d) as there is a stereotype of caucasians in Singapore looking down on the locals. Most of the time, it isn\u2019t true (although once in a while there are a few cunts doing that). I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve seen both sides of Singapore, the nice and the ugly. It shows that we Singaporeans are no different from any other country... some of us are just cunts. Hope that answers your question :)"

My only advice for u is to take your skateboard everywhere!!!! Skate to the mrt and back when u commute; skate end to end in the carpark; skate on campus; skate EVERYWHERE. No only will this help u feel more comfortable on the board, it can help u learn tricks in the future!\n\nIn terms of getting your first board, you can go really cheap and find some decent complete boards like from Yocaher boards on Shopee which will run u back around 70 bucks (my friends got me this for my birthday after i flung my board into the Singapore river\ud83d\ude2d). However if u wanna support the skateboarding community and support local businesses, i suggest you get a complete skateboard from Gosports at scape (around 150+), Spitfire skate at peninsula shopping centre (around 190+) or 418 Skateshop (Im not sure on the price for this shop is)\n\nAs a beginner I dont think you need to know the technicalities of each part and what you might need for your first skateboard. You will learn as u progress and learn tutorials on what kind of skateboarding you prefer.\n\nAs for the busy schedule, just skate to study spots. The only place i was denied entry because of my skateboard was a bar and a siamdu LOL\n\nsecurity guards wont chase u to stop (unless they REALLY damn boliao) just dont skate in the mrt station and youre good to go\n\nAll the best!\n\nP.S. one thing you need to get ready for is Falling!! It\u2019ll hurt like a b*tch. On Flat ground it wont be that bad if you just slip and fall. If you\u2019re moving and u lose your balance, try to land on your back (breaking your fall with your hands is a bad idea, trust me). If you\u2019re gonna commute on your board, even worse you\u2019ll fall in front of ppl so get ready for that (dunnid paiseh, most people are nice enough to help you). Also be vvv careful around intersections cuz thats where the shittiest pavements and roads are."

The girls there helped me pick out the bits for my first custom board and it\u2019s epic. They know everything there is to know about skateboarding the boards the components etc. Once you have your board you can head to the skate parks at Kallang. Somerset or east coast park. Each day there is someone there starting out for the first time. \n\nLike any other thing, we tend to be a bit rubbish at the beginning but with a little dedication and practice we become amazing. Get your board, shoot even get a pre built one. (They are a lot cheaper) and just skate. \n\nLessons can be a little expensive in Singapore but def worth it if you can afford. Approx $50 per session but I would recommend porvida skateboarding it\u2019s run by a guy called Pham. He and his team coach my daughter \ud83d\ude09"

But found some ulu-er spots to start practicing, like Bishan park or Punggol waterway at odd hours.., so my embarrassment at least wouldn\u2019t get in the way of me learning. After a while I got confidence in the fact that I was at least trying, and even though I still suck at it, I\u2019m happy to go skating through neighbourhoods now and eat pavement in front of a bunch of strangers if necessary. \n\nOne random thing I also had to get over was walking around carrying my skateboard when I wasn\u2019t confident of the surface.. but I just let people imagine I came from such a long exhausting day doing tricks so whatever, I\u2019m tired now~ -hairflip-\n\nAlso i love my landyachtz dinghy! Nice intermediary between longboard and skateboard... stable and easy to get going on, but nimble enough to try some tricks (not like i\u2019ve tried). Got it from Longboard Love Skate shop on telok blangah, awesome place with great boards and nice people. And a nice road outside to practice how embarrassing it can get before buying \ud83d\udc4d\n\nHave fun!! Very excited for you."

Considering how many variants there are, you're talking about the [this](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Basic-skateboard-Step-5.jpg/aid171359-v4-728px-Basic-skateboard-Step-5.jpg) type of skateboard right?\n\nFor a start, the decks (the top wooden part) come in different sizes (widths and lengths). I think the widths are more important as it should correlate to the size of your feet. A proper skate shop should size you up. Please don't get something from like the supermarkets or decathlon. Nothing really wrong with that, but there are much better and reputable [skate brands](https://www.the-house.com/portal/top-ten-skateboard-brands/) out there. I always thought the art are very cool. I still have my board hanging in my room even after I stopped more than 10 years ago. \n\nI think that skating is something you'll figure out as you go along. It sounds like you're planning to learn how to do tricks. I think one piece of advice I can give is to get so-called average bearings. I feel that one mistake I learnt back then was to get extremely good ones. This made board became too fast to ride for me. Although that felt great to cruise at higher speeds, it made it too slippery to learn tricks for a beginner and affected my confidence. \n\nDon't worry about being discriminated. If you go to the parks (like the one at ECP) there are plenty of other girls and beginners too. The skating community is actually nice and welcoming, but unfortunately we get a lot of flak for it. I also sometimes see a lot of girls skating at the parks alone. You could just approach them to make new friends. Have fun."

Its awesome that you decided to pick up a new skill!\n\nWhile I can't speak for skateboarding itself, I've always adviced students to get the most basic of gear. \n\n1. Unfortunately, sometimes once people get a feel of it, believe it's too difficult and give up. (Record breaking 1 hour after buying a new pair of skates)\n\n2. The first feeling of \"upgrading\" is always amazing.\n\n3. You'll know firsthand on what you need to spend on Vs what you can stinge on.\n\nYou're probably going to mess up. A lot. Everyday. Infront of everyone. But that's okay! I've probably messed up a thousand times more Infront of people than pulling off a trick.\n\nYouTube videos are great for learning! But having a \"mentor\" speeds up the process. You could probably learn all the tricks if you spend enough time practicing and learning from YouTube, as most things are these days. But having someone to guide your minor mistakes while your practicing really helps a lot. Alternatively you could video your attempts, they give you a much clearer picture as to what is going on.\n\nAlso, once you get to a certain point, review your accident insurance."

For your budget you'll be able to get a room in the areas close to the Central Business District and maybe a studio further out. \n\nI live in River Valley about 10 mins from Somerset MRT in a 2 bed room. The rent's about 4k but I split it with my SO. My office in the CBD is about 20 mins bus ride but I mostly work remote. I like this place because it's close to the riverside at Robertson Quay and the botanic gardens and even though it's a bunch of high rise condos  and restaurants there's also a lot of nature. This area is mostly young expats with families. For context, I'm a 24 year old female expat who moved back 2 years ago to work. I went to high school here. \n\nMost of my friends who work in the CBD lives in Tanjong Pagar, Tiong Bahru or Chinatown which are like the semi-gentrified hip parts of town. Lots of bars, clubs and restaurants but not a lot of nature. A lot of young new comers to the country move here so it kind of feels like a large hostel. \n\nA lot of older expat families live in the Marine Parade and  Katong area in the east or Bukit Timah area in the west. My family moved to Singapore in the early 2000s and lived in the Marine Parade area near the East Coast Beach. Fantastic area but now it's mostly older retired people like my Dad. \n\nHope your move goes well!"

You can try kallang bahru, thats a very old Singaporean estate 10 mins from downtown line. You can look for HDBs (government housing) there, try out for a short term lease then decide to move later, i would save as much as i can at the start. Travel around and settle down a bit. Before really choosing an area, where you friends are or an area you like. \n\nUnless you want to live a more luxurious lifestyle with a pool, gym etc you can try condominiums that would fix in your budget or even hmlet, for around 1.6k to 2k. You can find something decent. They pay all the water electricity internet for you, plus i think they do cleaning (please check this) this will lower the stress of shifting to a new place as well.\n\nBest of luck!"

                "comment": "In Singapore, at least within the downtown area, there will be lots of gym places.  3k/month can typically get you a nice 1 or 2 bedroom condo apartment there too.\n\nRaffles Quay is within walking distance of the Red (North-South) Line, Green (East-West) Line, and Blue (Downtown) Line.  So, as long as you get a condo that is near one of these lines, you will have an easy time getting to and from work.  Singapore's MRT is reliable and comes frequently (3min interval during peak hours and 5min interval during off-peak hours).\n\nIf you are looking for actual condo recommendations, I'm afraid I don't have any, and I'm not sure if anyone can say much, since there are just too many condos in Singapore.  But there are popular neighbourhoods for expats who are Westerners.  If you wish to live amongst expats, you can look at places such as Tanjong Pagar, Robertson Quay / River Valley, Tiong Bahru, and Holland Village.\n\nIf you are looking for some tips about renting in Singapore, here are some for your consideration:\n\n(1) It sounds as though you are looking to get a condo rental in Singapore before actually moving to Singapore.  I would advise against that.  I highly recommend that you come to Singapore first, perhaps put yourself up at some hotel or service apartment for a week or two as you condo-hunt.  This will allow you to view the apartment, the building, the facilities, and the surrounding environment for yourself.  I wouldn't put too much trust in the photos that you see online.  I also wouldn't put too much trust in the property agent, unless you have good reasons to trust him/her.\n\n(2) Make sure you have a written contract to sign with the landlord/lady. Don't just agree verbally.  Without the contract, there is little you can do if the landlord/lady decides to cheat you.\n\n(3) Visit the place you are thinking of renting a few times, on different times of the day.  This is to get a better sense of the place at different times. E.g. will be it very hot in the late afternoon because of the afternoon sun, will it be noisy because it is facing an MRT track or near the main road or near a school or near a construction site, etc.\n\n(4). It is likely that your utilities will be separate from your rental, and so you will have to budget for that.  You will also most likely need to get your utilities and internet set up, and that will take a week or two.  In addition, Singapore landlords/ladies are particular about air conditioning units' maintenance, and typically expect tenants to pay for the servicing, which costs about SGD50/unit once every quarter.\n\n(5) Make sure there is a clause in the contract saying how much notice in advance both parties have to give each other before moving out.  You don't want a situation where the landlord/lady kicks you out without giving you time to find a new place.  The typical notice period is 1 month, but is negotiable if you want a different length of time.\n\n(6) Also, Singapore rental typically has a deposit fee, which is usually one month's rent, and it is paid upfront.  So you will have to have two months' worth of money to rent a place, one for deposit, one for the first month's rental.  The deposit should be returned to you when you are moving out.\n\n(7) Remember to ask for receipts for rental / deposit payments, so that there will be no dispute in the future.\n\n(8) If you are more adventurous and would like to appreciate the local communities more, instead of just hanging out with Westerners all the time, you can consider living away from the downtown area.  Rent will definitely be cheaper, but travelling to work will still be manageable as long as you are near a Red, Green, or Blue line.\n\nI hope this helps.  Feel free to ask if you have more questions."

It\u2019s worth paying for it if you are new to singapore.\n\nFor utilities budget $150-$200 if you are an aircon type person\n$50 for internet at home\n\nGeylang is quite ok but the units can be really small.

Looking at property guru, I see that there's an agent associated with the post. Am I subjected to pay a fee to this agent, or is this only for the landlord/ladies side? Given that, is it recommended to get myself an agent or is it not worth the cost? ( I've heard is it half a months rent)\n\nThanks again :)"

So I wouldn't repeat what's said.\n\n(1) SGD150 for utilities and SGD50 for internet is about right.  But there are options in Singapore, so make sure you shop around, especially for electricity.  Singapore has an open-market policy for electrical supply.  You'll have to open an account with SP (Singapore Power), but you can choose your electrical supplier.  For more information, you can have a look at the following links:\n\n[https://blog.moneysmart.sg/budgeting/open-electricity-market-singapore/](https://blog.moneysmart.sg/budgeting/open-electricity-market-singapore/)\n\n[https://compare.openelectricitymarket.sg/#/home](https://compare.openelectricitymarket.sg/#/home)\n\n(2) I have heard good things about Hmlet.  Another well-known co-living place in Singapore is Cove.  Have a look at both for some comparison.  Importantly, ask them about their COVID management and arrangement.  Things might have changed a little due to governmental restrictions.\n\n(3) What u/yiantay-sg said.  Also, because of the smaller roads, road traffic can be bad during peak hours in Geylang.  But if you most rely on the MRT, then that's not too big an issue.  Here is a reddit post about living in Geylang (note that \"lor\" is short for \"lorong\", which means \"lane\"): [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/b3yxpd/living\\_in\\_geylang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/b3yxpd/living_in_geylang/)\n\n(4) What u/yiantay-sg said.  And the agent in the listing is the landlord/lady's, and afaik, you don't have to pay him/her anything.  For your own agent, you can look for those expats in Singapore groups on the various social media platforms and ask if anyone has any good agents to recommend.\n\nIn addition, have a look at the following website for some explanations on common practices in Singapore's rental market, including agent fees: [https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/commission-property-agents/](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/commission-property-agents/)\n\nTwo other things for your consideration:\n\n(a) When looking at condos, you should also look at the vacancy rate.  This can be done by checking out how many units are on sale / on rental at the moment.  If the condo has a high vacancy rate, it is worth asking why.  Why are people not renting or buying the units in this condo?  It doesn't mean you shouldn't rent there, it just means you might want to know the reason(s) for its high vacancy rate.\n\n(b) Also, if you want, you can search for condo reviews.  Investors commonly post condo reviews online to share their thoughts on major condo projects in Singapore.  These can give you a good insight into some pros and cons of the condo you are looking at.  Just google \"name of condo\" + \"review\" + \"sg / singapore\" should do it.\n\nIf you have more questions, feel free to ask them."

But it really depends.\n\nIf you hire an agent, they will have the resources and knowledge, and that will save you quite a bit of back-and-forth.  If you are doing it on your own, then you might want to give yourself a little more time.\n\nBesides, if you really cannot find a condo that you like, you can always extend your stay at the co-living place.  You just need to check with them prior to booking what their procedures are for an extension (perhaps ask about week-by-week extension?).\n\nDon't forget that, if you want, you can actually start house-hunting when you are in quarantine.  You can do that via remote video viewing.  Many agents offer such a service.  So, while you are in quarantine, you can eliminate condos that you don't like, short-list 3 or 4 condos that you like, and view these 3 or 4 condos after your quarantine period.  This will save you some time.\n\nThe other important thing to bear in mind might be, giving yourself time to (1) set up the utilities, (2) buy furniture, crockery, cutlery, etc etc etc (3) set up the internet.  It takes about 2 weeks to set up utilities and internet in Singapore.\n\nNote that you can get a local SIM-only mobile plan at the airport, right outside the baggage claims area, just before entering quarantine.  You can get one to survive the first 2 weeks in Singapore, and then change your plan later as you shop for a more permanent mobile plan while in quarantine.  Just make sure you have a mobile that is not locked to your current network.\n\nAll the best!  And feel free to ask if you have more questions."

Lighter is better because more nimble and easy to bring around, but more expensive.\n\nMany foldable bikes will look like they have same body frame. To me not much different which can be good or bad thing. \n\nCheck Carousell too if you don\u2019t mind secondhand. Could have good savings there. Lots of bike sellers there too"

Honestly, its like any other neighbourhood in Singapore. Except there are more cats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) I grew up in Admiralty, about 9 years ago. As a kid I wasn't scared or anything but there were slashings and gangs apparently. But I didn't witness anything and my childhood life there was quite sweet, I met a lot of friends there. My experience in Yishun, near Chong Pang, has been quite good. I really like Northpoint City as it is convenient. Being close to Sembawang Shopping Centre has its perks as Im able to choose between 2 shopping centres based on my preferences.\n\n2) Where I live, near Chong Pang, I like that it is semi-bustling yet quiet, its that point where you dont feel scared to go out in the middle of the night for a jog. Yet its not as noisy as in Chong Pang itself where theres constant noise.\n\n3) Recently, I started seeing more rats and cockroaches. I feel that its the same situation throughout Singapore because I see them in more affluent neighbourhoods too. But then again, its one thing I dislike. Im also 5-10 minutes bus ride away from the MRT, so thats a little annoying as well. Especially for my girlfriend, because she travels to see me almost every day and its a hassle for her.\n\n4) I guess the abundance of good food in the hawker centres. Im not much of a foodie but I think Chong Pang used to have better food in the past.\n\n5) I'd rather not, but Im used to living here so I dont mind. I just dont like how the houses are designed in this area so Ill probably not purchase a house here in the future."

It's easy to make new friends, though I've heard from my foreign friends that it might be harder to make local friends (?) It's something I've noticed as well, expats tend to live in their own bubble and not have many local friends. \nIn terms of platforms to make friends, expat Facebook groups, friends of friends, Meetup.com would serve you well :)"

If you can, you'll probably only be allowed to rent a room within some categories. Otherwise, you can check out condos. Heartlands would be cheaper than the usual places where expats are found. Rent should be around ~2.5k for the master room if I remember correctly (which means you have a bathroom to yourself).\n\nTransport wise, it is pretty convenient as the buses and mrt (kinda like metro) would take you to most places just fine. Taxis are not cheap, but a lot cheaper as compared to the uk. We have quite a few festivals throughout the year, namely Chingay, various new years of the main races, national day parade, etc. Basically something every other month. Festivals to remember the dead include Qing Ming and what's known as 7th month lol \n\nArguably, food is our main culture. Source for food at hawker centres/food courts for cheaper fares (and authentic tastes). Lau Pa Sat is a popular spot, but overpriced and over hyped (imo). Sg is known for her nightlife, check out Robertson Quay/Clarke Quay area.\n\nIf you haven't already, you can join the expat forum."

They used to have quiz nights at pubs & someone's house (but he has relocated now) and bbq sessions. \n\nThe company is located at One North (nearest mrt station, about 1KM away). I'd look at houses in Holland Village, Commonwealth, Ghim Moh, Pandan Valley, and Clementi first as they are the nearest. However I'm not sure if you can find anything in Commonwealth or Ghim Moh as they are usually for young couples in sg who are starting families, or the elderly. I mention location only because I'm the type that likes to live near work so I can reach home fast after a long day\ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm not too sure with the packages/hdb houses in terms of rent bc I stayed at home with my parents when I was there. But I think a common room is about 1k/month in the hdb above Clementi mall. You may want to check the minimum amount that you have to pay before getting the subsidies, that's the only reason why some of my boyfriend's friends took the ensuite/master rooms, because it works out to be about 100-200 difference."

BTO is good if you're able to grab the grants as well, otherwise if you factor in the above, you won't be making much profit when you sell in the future.\n\nIs BTO a long term investment? I feel no, but given the options available, BTO is still the best in the market, I feel if you want to buy a property now, buy for the need, not the greed, whatever profit you make from your current one, you'll have to put into renovation for the new house as well.\n\nWhen you calculate remember to keep 20k in CPF OA to enjoy the 3.5% interest"

For most, it will be a significant rise in value and since the physical value is low, the % returns are generally higher.\n\n2) When you hit the lottery and get a BTO in a hot estate (i.e Duxton or the upcoming Southern Waterfront Area)"

You'll want to look for proximity to the MRT station (preferably Green EW Line). Their respective MRT stations are all within 20mins of Fusionopolis (one-north). \n\nSome neighbourhoods to avoid: Holland Village, Bukit Timah, Dover. Apartments here are more pricey. \n\nHope this helps!"

This is especially true since you & your family will not be eligible for citizen subsidies especially pertaining to healthcare, childcare etc. The $6k minimum is there for a reason. \n\nWhile your wife is technically supposed to find a job first before entering Singapore, it is not uncommon for foreigners to attend job interviews on a tourist visa. In your wife's case, she has a legitimate reason for entering Singapore: to help you with the move to Singapore. There's just nothing stopping her from going for a few job interviews too. But of course, she **cannot** tell immigration she is here to look for a job; that's an instant denial of entry. \n\nIf the job search goes well, she can look into converting the tourist visa into a work permit. Or else, she can return home first to sort out the paperwork, then fly back into Singapore on the work permit."

They usually open in the morning and get sold out by 1pm, 2pm if you're lucky.)\n\nSource: I am a hokkien mee and chicken rice lover. I can eat these dishes everyday.\n\nIf you're not into the peppery kind of bak kut teh, you can go for the \"Malaysian\" Herbal kind. There's one I always go to at Alexandra market, Leon Kee Claypot Pork Rib soup. The two fruit juice stalls beside it sell awesome avocado juice too."

Bed, small desk, wardrobe etc. Most landlords wouldn\u2019t go through the hassle of cabling LAN from router to the spare room. Hence, it\u2019s the norm to provide just wifi. Most of us rent out spare rooms, so you may be living with the landlord. Get to know them & their rules before committing.\n\nI used to work in One-North area too :) I\u2019d recommend staying in the west. If you want to save more, find a house that isn\u2019t near malls, or a little distance away from MRT(bus transfer). You can go to food centres & supermarkets in residential areas. And commute a few stops to malls for shopping/movies on days off. The places I recommend below have malls near the MRT. \n-Buona Vista (Mall: Star Vista/no cinema)\n-Jurong East (3 malls. Busy area)\n-Bukit Batok (West Mall)\n-Boon Lay (Mall: Jurong Point)\n\nYou actually earn more than me after tax. I\u2019m a junior office worker. You could get by fine, with 650-800SGD rental."

                "comment": "1. usually it's fully furnished in my pov. So you don't have to spend your money on furniture that you'd eventually leave behind when you leave. I don't think the rental amount will go down much if you request to remove some furniture. It costs money to get bulky furnitures removed. AS for the bed, if you are sticky about the mattress, you can consider buying your own mattress? Not an expert in this. When my hubs first came to SG and rented a place, he just used his own bedsheets over the existing bed. \n\nWe use laptops but desktops are also WiFi enabled (there are those dongles for desktops). Home owners usually offer WiFi instead of letting you use the router or Ethernet cable (my understanding is because the owners are usually paying for the internet contract?). Unless you stay with fellow rentees, you can negotiate with them? \n\n2. most neighbourhoods have a mall near the MRT station. if that's your definition of good. Popular estates like Clementi will cost more for a room ($1k for master bedroom) and maybe slightly lesser for a common bedroom (but you have to share toilet space with another stranger). Personally, i'd not spend more than $1k on rent (to ensure it includes utility bills cost). I've come across some landlords that charge a slightly cheaper rent but you have to pay for the utility bills. If you're living with your landlord, thre is a high chance they won't like you to cook at home. Hence you'd be spending money on food or the occasional beer with your colleagues. My hubs found himself not able to save money in the beginning and it took some time for him.\n\n3. You can consider renting rooms at Commonwealth, Queenstown or Clementi. Although i feel Clementi's rates might be a wee bit more expensive. But i'm not in touch with the current pricing. \n\n4. Clementi has 2 malls near the MRT. It has almost all the shops you can find in town. There is a cinema there and it's pretty low in traffic. \nQueenstown doesn't have a mall nearby but there is a mall (not sure if they have a cinema but definitely a grocery supermarket)and IKEA one bus stop away. They have a food center there too with a wide range of local food at economical prices (great for the wallet).\nCommonwealth doesn't have a mall nearby but there is Seng Siong (supermarket), food court and a wet market near the train station. \n\n5. I dont see any drinking places around this area. Peeps usually head down to Holland V, Clarke Quay or Robertson Quay to drink. So you should be relatively safe if you choose to rent in one of the 3 options that i've shared. There might be one or two drinking establishments but i doubt it'll be too rowdy.\n\n6. In my POV, i'd rather not share room or toilet with a stranger. But it all depends on your budget. Hope that you can manage to get a reasonable rental :) \n"

Property guru is the site to look at for property.\n\nIn terms of locations, there's nowhere bad like you'd get in the UK. Some areas have more going on than others, some are just full of HDBs and not a lot else.  I'd definitely stick to the EW line (green) rather than going north on the NS line. All the stops from BV to Tiong Bahru are great. Tiong Bahru itself is very cool and as close as Singapore gets to hipstery. Loads of nice cafes etc. I'd check that out rather than North. Clementi and Dover both nice, a bit expat family maybe.\n\nGenerally, Singapore is extremely expensive. Eating at hawkers is cheap though as you say. To be blunt, your salary won't go far here. Is there any scope to increase it? Many expats are on double that easily, and still struggle. \n"

                "comment": "Most things have been more or less covered and I'll chip in some additional opinions, especially so since I just returned from London to Singapore last Nov.\n\nIf you are working near Buona Vista (BV) you could (and actually should) consider locations along the yellow line as well. There are interesting and convenient neighborhoods along this line too. Also, what amenities are you specifically looking for in terms of accessibility? the urban planning of Singapore outside its historical centre includes multiple town hubs, usually near a train station, and then neighbourhood centres at a more local scale. Everyday amenities ain't a big problem in most neighbourhoods as far as I know. Although high street-ish facilities are integrated into malls, however, pubs remain scattered at more happening (and consequently more expensive) places e.g. Tanjong Pagar and Holland Village.\n\nSince you don't mind to move further away from the city, for west I'd recommend areas like Clementi (a very mature housing estate, highly accessible, and offers a range of amenities) and Jurong East (the new hub in the West, but am not sure why I'm somehow picturing Stratford without its major problems, however, it gets rather crowded especially during commuting peaks).\n\nI'd not recommend some expat hotspots in your case - Bukit Timah and Upper Bukit Timah (Beauty World) are not the most convenient places if you don't drive, although you could choose bus or bounce across a few lines in this case. Holland Village is a stone's throw from your office with a lot of amenities but it's rather expensive. Central parts of Singapore e.g. Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, and Toa Payoh, as well as the central-northeast e.g. Farrer Park, Boon Keng, Serangoon, are really convenient to live imo. As for the east side, Bedok and Tampines are pretty cool too but they a wee bit too far. Some parts of Geylang offer plentiful studio apartments but do a bit research about that area might help your decision-making. A stereotypically 'boring' part of Singapore around Bukit Panjang to Hillview ain't too bad to live as they are not too expensive but still offer some amenities, just not that 'vibrant' to some. I'm sorry if this part comes way too messy, and it seems that I am just throwing in random places in. Property Guru, 99co, and STproperty are the most commonly used platforms locally so do play around with their features e.g. amenities within X radius.\n\nAs for phone bill, gym membership, and insurance etc, do check with your company's actual package, because some do offer subsidies and benefits. Food budget is fairly flexible if you cook and meal-prep, and would like to experience local hawker culture - getting a coffee at \u00a31 and a meal at \u00a33/4 is manageable. However, dining out at fancy spots and having a few drinks could cause some significant damage, and booze is especially expensive here. Public transport is pretty affordable, and you could do your calculation to save more [with concession](https://dollarsandsense.sg/concession-passes-working-adults-ever-worth/)\n\nWith some financial planning, I believe you could save a bit monthly, but highly depending on your lifestyle. And since you're gonna be in Singapore, it's pretty easy to travel around Southeast Asia, and even further away. This could be another thread itself as different styles of traveling have very different financial consequences, but many destinations ain't too expensive and there are a lot of hidden gems regionally.  And if you could secure some good deals, regional budget airlines are fairly affordable too."

I previously done 2hrs each way and now do 1.5hrs each way. \n\nThanks for the recommendations it is very helpful in my decision making/price estimations. I come from around Croydon and recently moved into a small village just within the M25. Used to the rougher areas and now one with barely anything to do hence my flexibility on locations :) \n\nYea, I am currently weighing up my options and am waiting for my company to provide a definitive salary range for the position. The same role is offered in both SG and London. The London wage is going for 40k to 45k excl 10% discretionary bonus. I was working off this range and directly translating it to SGD (Probably not the best way to do it, but its giving me some initial expectations). There could be potential for higher salary and even some relocation perks to support me but working off a \"worst case scenario\" right now until I get more details.\n\nIn terms of money not going far I am used to barely breaking even here in London. I currently earn 20.5k GBP a year working two jobs whilst studying part time (up from 16k 4 years ago). I am pretty used to my money not stretching far hahah. I dont expect to live like a king by any means but even just going out 1 time a week or having \u00a3200 \"play money\" a month would be a massive quality of life change for me that I do not currently get to enjoy here in the UK.\n\n"

Look to the west where TEL or Jurong Region MRT Line will be built or DT line where the final phase is almost complete. A BTO will take 4 years to be ready so that can be a guide.\n\nIf you prefer an estate that already has a sizeable young families demographic, NE areas such as Punggol or Sengkang and E areas like Tampines and Pasir Ris will be good. They are also near the airport if travelling is your thing(for work or for holidays)\n\nI would say transport is very fast in Singapore, takes 45 mins from Punggol to Harbourfront and about 1.5hrs from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon. During peak hours, it is recommended to have lines that have redundancy or transport nodes that have various buses to your work place in order to avoid the morning crowd."

The Eastern from jervois rd) and middle portion (everything in between) of RV is more assessable by bus rather than mrt. Also consider that RV is bounded by a river and the terrain has many small hills and slopes, so walking to fort canning mrt or even somerset mrt is more than just drawing lines on the map. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to say that Clarke quay mrt also serves this area, Remember that Clarke quay mrt is on the other side of the river at the central mall side, a big distance from RV proper. It may serve Clarke quay businesses but for residents as OP could potentially be, its quite far and doesn\u2019t make sense to use. Clarke quay is a bus ride down from RV though. "

It'll give you a good idea of what estates we have. Where they are on the map is generally where they are physically, although the distance can be misleading at times.\n\nThere's a post with [tongue-in-cheek depictions of what each area has](https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/dude-designs-singapore-map-divided-8-hilariously-accurate-ways/), and while most of the jokes will probably go over your head, the fifth map (with one of the legion being marked as \"nothing but industry\") will give you a rough idea of where everything is located. The areas in the extreme west, extreme east, and slightly east of central is where all the factories are. You have the super upscale shopping malls in the central area, with a bunch of other enjoyable shopping malls spread throughout Singapore. The rest are mostly residential areas, smaller malls, schools, etc. Here's a [visual guide](https://www.mapsland.com/maps/asia/singapore/travel-illustrated-map-of-singapore.jpg).\n\nSome honourable mentions of the aforementioned shopping malls: Causeway Point in Woodlands, North Point in Yishun, JCube/West Gate/JEM in Jurong East, ION and a bunch of other expensive malls I don't know about in Orchard, Vivocity in Harbourfront/near Sentosa, Bugis Junction in Bugis, Tampines 1/Tampines Mall/Century Square in Tampines."

I would suggest Holland Village which you would then be able to take the metro to work (circle / orange line). \n\nIf you're more of the blend in with the local and don't do much outside work hours except for heading out on weekends and such, then you can consider the Commonwealth or Clementi area (east west/green line). \n\nEither way both options ensure your daily commute is not extensive. As much as SG is small and convenient to get to anywhere but it's really no fun squeezing with peak hour crowd like a herd. \n\nI think 1k is quite a comfortable budget to rent a room here. What you may even consider is just arriving and checking where does some of your colleagues stays and what's their commute like. \n\nThe property guru site is quite useful to have a look at the various estates before going down and also to check on what's the market rates are like.\n\nIf I may ask, when will you be arriving?"

For now, I'm looking up routes so that I arrive at the office by 9 am, so I'll likely be getting on MRTs / buses on rush hours. I was wondering how easy is it to get on public transport during rush hour. Will I have to leave home a bit earlier incase I cant get on the MRT because its too full or are public transport generally not that full / cramped?"

If you need a healthier but non-meat option, Greendot is fantastic albeit pricier.\nAlthough if you have spare time, supermarkets here sell ingredients for quite cheap so you can prepare an easy dish for yourself to save costs.\nBudget should be about $25 for food per day maximum.\nTransport should only be maximum $8 if you are only travelling to and fro BV to Far East.\nPersonally its easier to use prepaid especially since you're staying for a relatively long period compared to tourists."

This is near Telok Blangah MRT. Or you can take a bus from Harbourfront MRT.\n\nFor city sights you can visit Marina Bay to see the skyline or simply just spend it in Orchard Road for shopping.\n\nFor drinks and night life you can visit Clarke Quay.\n\nIt really depends on what you want to see and experience though. Personally I feel Sentosa has a lot to offer for family fun. :)"

I only speak English and have rarely had issues communicating in S'pore. \n\nDepending on what you and your family enjoy, these would be my recommendations of what to visit:\n\n* Gardens by the Bay\n* Sentosa Island (Universal Studios, awesome aquarium (expensive though))\n* Tiong Bahru - historic and hip neighbourhood, purposely not built up (all buildings capped at 3 storeys), best bakery, good cafes and cute shops (http://www.visitsingapore.com/walking-tour/culture/in-the-neighbourhood-tiong-bahru/)\n* Chinatown\n* Arab Quarter - pretty + can buy cheap pashminas here (expensive in NZ where I'm from)\n* Haji Lane - trendy and hip street, near to Arab Quarter\n* Night Safari\n* River Safari zoo - pandas!\n* Botanical Gardens\n* Singapore Museum\n* Peranakan Museum - showcases the history and culture of the Peranakan people. In a beautiful historic building and has a stunning collection of furniture, clothes, etc. (http://peranakanmuseum.org.sg/)\n* Eat at a hawker centre/visit Lau Pa Sat (http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/architecture/historical/lau-pa-sat/)\n* Singapore Art Museum (SAM) - always has great exhibitions and based in a beautiful colonial building\n* Gardens by the Bay - never seen anything like it before, also amazing greenhouses.\n* Marina Bay Sands - right next to Gardens by the Bay, there used to be a daily projected light show outside the mall/hotel. Worth seeing if it's still running.\n* For good views of the city - Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, ION on Orchard (free viewing deck)\n\nFor cheap meals, I would always try to eat at a hawker centre. Cafes, restaurants, and even food courts in malls can be expensive (or at least more expensive than hawker centres).\n\nThe MRT is very easy to use and everything is in English. I've always found taxis easy to come by and relatively cost-effective. \n\nHave a great time in Singapore!"

It is also convenient to go to other shopping malls such as Suntec City and Orchard Road. Singapore is pretty safe so no worries. You should buy an ezlink card (worth $10) to aid in your travel on our public transport system so that you don't need to queue for a one time ticket for our mrt and take out coins and notes for bus rides.\nYou can consider going to universal studios singapore, (Harbourfront MRT) or Gardens by the Bay (Bay front mrt)  and going to Singapore zoo (cck mrt and then changing to bus) hope this helps :) "

Any alternatives? Would help a lot in the \"not getting lost\" part.\n\nWhere are you putting up for the period in Singapore? There is the MRT (Metro/ Tube) which is pretty convenient to get around if you want to save some $. Alternatively, you can use Uber or GrabTaxi to get a ride. Do indicate that you want to get a pickup at the Departure instead of arrival, it is easier for the drive to find where you are. Eg Exit 1 of Terminal 2\n\n> I have the following things in my mind: Gardens by the Bay, the night zoo, Orchard rd, Sentosa (??? I will probably see some of it while going back-n-forth to ZoukOut), Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown, Little India. Any suggestions regarding my picks? I know it's not much of an \"itinerary\", but I didn't have a lot of free time to plan this trip.\n\nLittle India is fine, but do note that most foreign low wage workers from India / Sri Lanka / Bangladesh  (working in construction) usually spend their weekends in Little India. It get's pretty chaotic due to the influx of people.\n\nDo visit Chinatown in the earlier half of the day. Lots of tourist shops and stuff to look at (Hindu Temple, Chinese Temple). If you like a day tour + finding out about our History (Food History) you can click [here](https://www.viator.com/tours/Singapore/Singapore-Hawker-Center-Food-Tour-in-Chinatown/d18-6458SING1)\n\n> Also, on a different note: Any tips from veteran ZoukOut-ers? From Friday night, to Sunday morning I will be partying there, and I've heard a lot of good, but also bad things about the experience. Are the queues really that bad everywhere? Are the drink & food prices out of proportions? I've read some Facebook reviews, and this is all I could get out of it, and I didn't really like it, but what can you do...\n\nWater is served around $8-10 a bottle. (Last time i went was in '12) Queues are ok and pretty orderly. I recommend that you drink alcohol only towards the end / the last 2 sets else you'll get gassed pretty quickly. Just bring $200 and you can be covered for almost anything.\n\n> What about transport to-and-from Sentosa to the city? I will be staying on Dickson Road, which is pretty close to Little India stop on the MRT map. Is the public transport system working day & night?\n\nYou take the MRT to Harbourfront and you take the skytrain on the [third floor of Vivocity to Sentosa](http://staging.sentosa.com.sg/en/getting-around/sentosa-express/), get off at the Beach Station, its a 10 minutes walk from there.\n\nTransport system work both day and night. Last MRT is in between 12-1am. Then it's taxi / Grab / Uber after that.\nIt is pretty safe here, walking around at 3am won't get you mugged. There are lots of supper spots near your place of stay.\n\nOnce the party ends, there will be free shuttle buses from Sentosa -> Harbourfront. I recommend that you bring a singlet + small face towel so you can freshen up yourself before you leave the place\n\n > Oh and another thing... Sadly, from where I come, it's not unusual that tourists get scammed, so this is why I'm asking the following: any special things that I should keep an \"extra eye on\"? or any places NOT to go?\n\nDo not buy electronics from [Sim Lim Square](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/blogs/going-out-by-day/sim-lim-cheating-vendors-named-shamed-080508598.html) unless you know what you want and the RRP of the product. Another places to avoid is Lucky Plaza too. If you intend to get electronics, drop me a PM, i can advise where is a place you can go to.\n\nThere is no place not to go in Singapore, just don't be a sucker and get taken for a ride. You see that lady beckoning you for a drink at a Karaoke TV pub, you better know how much you gonna pay before blindly ordering stuff.\n\nIf you are into trannies, Orchard Plaza is the place for you.\nIf you are into standard prostitution, Geylang is where you want to go. Do note that the streetwalkers are illegal prostitutes. Legal ones are in brothels and typically cost more.\n\nIf you want to know about stuff in Singapore, you can post here or ask on /r/Singapore too\n\nParty hard, party smart. Welcome to Singapore."

Sometimes Uber can cost more than GrabCar or Taxi, so do check out the prices across both apps first before ordering your Uber/Grab\n\n>I have the following things in my mind: Gardens by the Bay, the night zoo, Orchard rd, Sentosa (???

Many nice bars/pubs to chill or have a nice dinner at. For sightseeing/shopping, you may also visit Haji Lane, which is in Kampong Glam. It is rows of shophouses selling clothing/\"hipster\" items. The backs of the shophouses also have pretty wall paintings that people like to take photos of.\n\n>Also, on a different note: Any tips from veteran ZoukOut-ers?

I've read some Facebook reviews, and this is all I could get out of it, and I didn't really like it, but what can you do...\n\nFood and drinks are generally quite expensive in ZoukOut. A cup of beer costs about $10. Most people who go to ZoukOut would buy loads of beer/drinks from the convenience store in Sentosa and drink before entering. I would suggest you do the same, or go to a bar/pub to drink before going to ZoukOut. Starker is a good option if you like beer, or FIVE bar for other types of alcohol.\n\nThe queue wasn't bad when I went to Zoukout 2 years ago.\n\n>What about transport to-and-from Sentosa to the city?

All tourist spots are very accessible via MRT. "

I've been to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia before, so I know how important the food culture is in SEA, and I would think that it would be the same for Singapore as well, especially since it must have a lot of influences from all the neighbouring countries. I will look into the IT industry there, I am mostly skilled in project management related automations and the IT part of it. And about the drink: I am sure I cannot buy traditional Hungarian 'Palinka' at the duty free shop :( That would be the point of the whole thing, to bring a little bit of my culture to my friends in Vietnam.

I currently stay around Buona Vista and its really convenient for me, but I think one of the major factors for you would be where your work place is located. \n\nIf you're working in the CBD area such as Raffles Place, then I would probably recommend places closer to the downtown area.\n\nAnother factor would be if you prefer bustling or quiet neighbourhoods and your means of transport. While it is convenient to be near the MRTs, if you don't plan on taking them and you prefer quiet areas then you would be paying extra to be near the MRTs for no reason. \n\nI'm super curious as to what you're working as although I understand if you'd rather not say! :)\n\nI'm honestly not that familiar with housing prices since I haven't really done much research on it so I apologize if I give any wrong info.

There's an app version that you can buy but you can always just use the mobile website and it is the same thing. \n\nBut as others have said, you should factor in a wide buffer time because the bus system is very unpredictable and varies widely depending on traffic conditions. I've waited an hour at the stop for my bus before three of them arrive at the same time. But thankfully that is quite rare. \nAlso, during peak hours you may not be able to board the bus because it is filled to the brim, so you may end up having to wait for the next one 10 minutes later. And even that one might be full as well.\nGenerally I steer clear of buses whenever I can. \n\n\nThe train system is slightly more reliable because the trains arrive regularly every 3-5 minutes, but occasionally there may be delays because the train slows down or due to increasingly-common track faults. So don't expect to-the-minute accuracy like in Japan; a 10-15 minute buffer will be good. "

I would say that CBD area is convenient to live in, and since most people get off at those stations, you won't have much trouble getting on to get to Jurong East. If you have a vibrant night life, perhaps living in the city area would save you some money getting home. And it's true, the financial district area is quite dead on weekends in the day. \n\nThat being said, if your working hours are regular, heading home during peak hours would be a bitch and hence living closer (BV) is an advantage. Also since BV is on the circle line MRT, you might enjoy going to Holland Village, Upper Bukit Timah areas where quite a lot of expats hang out. BV also has tons of buses into town and the night rider runs there too.\n\nIf you want to sightsee around SG, I don't think either location makes a big difference because it's more of an occasion instead of working distance which is more of a regular affair. The train and bus system is well developed here. "

You need not heed it.**\n\n\n**My Answer: I would choose Buona Vista.**\n\nAs a local, I have to profess with some biaseness that I have never really found the CBD an inviting place for me to be in. My reasons:\n\n* General City Vibe: The whole atmosphere just feels unfriendly to me. It could just be me, but I am uncomfortable living in a city surrounded by large commercials buildings/towers. It just feels out of place for me.\n\n* Cost/expenses: Living near or in the city centre will obviously cost more. Whereas rent will cost less nearer to the outskirts.\n\nReasons for my choice:\n\n* Ease of Travel: You will work at the western site. Makes more sense to me to live nearer to the work place. If you live in Marina Bay, you will spend an hour or more to get to Tuas Biomedical Park daily. *Why not save a few more minutes of sleep?*\n\n* Environment: Living in a residential area just appeals to me.\n\n* Less Noisy: Although still bustling. It is less noisy than the city centre. Its more peaceful and quiet in a residential area.\n\n* More Space: I love to jog around the neighbourhood!\n\nAdvantages for Marina Bay:\n\n* More swanky\n\n* Easier to travel around SG\n\n* More sights to see\n\n* Easier access to the night life, i.e. pubs/clubs etc.\n\nIf it is your 1st time in SG or asia, I would like to add that SG is what we term **Little Asia**. As we are very westernized, it can be considered a **Gateway** for westerners to experience asia firsthand without some much culture shock.\n\nYou'll run out of places to visit after living here for a while, so don't bother so much about the local scenary. Use SG as your **BASE** and plan holiday trips to Thailand/Cambodia/Japan etc. if you can afford it.\n\nConsult some fellow Americans on the SG expat forum for their input. They may be able to offer some insight for you.\n\n* http://forum.singaporeexpats.com/\n\n**And lastly. Welcome to SG ;]**"

I'm assuming you're going to one of the local universities here, and so in that case, NTU would be more accessible from Choa Chu Kang, while NUS and SMU is more accessible from Bras Basah. You'll basically be paying more for the location and convenience in the Bras Basah location, whereas Choa Chu Kang is a little far from the all the action happening in the main shopping belt. But if the pool matters to you more, by all means go for it.\n\n2) I would say bring both jeans and shorts. It is quite acceptable to wear shorts when heading out, as the weather in Singapore is really hot and humid, especially during May-August. However, I would suggest bringing at least a pair of jeans/pants, just in case you need to dress smart-casual for a night out, or for a formal event. But in most cases, shorts will do fine.\n\n3) Your girlfriend does not need a visa if she is a German (i.e. EU) citizen.
