In case you get into an accident, it will reduce the excess that you have to pay to the minimum.\n\nNot saying that you're a shitty driver, but you're a new driver and the GoR is a windy piece of road and I'm sure you'll be rubbernecking at the sights. Stay safe, have fun."

Very peaceful (don't speed, cameras everywhere) watching the streetlight go past.\n\n3) Yishun Dam - can stop road side and look at the sea. If you go on weekend midnight, there will be stretch of cars, ppl like to fish there. Just be careful of LTA cos it's technically double yellow line \n\n4) Random roads in Holland, Bukit Timah, and Bedok South area - i like rooming at 8 figure houses and there are lots of them there\n\n5) Mount faber during early morning\n\nif you're bored you can what i do, i drive to parks like kent ridge/ mount faber at night and just sit there and stone"

You can dabao the beer on tap also, bring some glass bottles. They also will sell you plastic bottles for that purpose, but I find it loses effervescence fast that way.\n\nThe changi village hawker centre has alot of good food too. There's also a shop (Makan Melaka) selling chendol just opposite the Nasi lemak stalls. The guy hand makes the green wormy things in the morning, so it's legit.\n\nChangi Chapel and Musuem is worth checking out if you want to learn more about ww2 history during the Japanese occupation.

This what I did when Grab economy was down to pay off the rental until I couldn't. Nothing is too low for you right now if you're looking to survive.\n\n-Look at freelance delivery services for F&B businesses. This is tough to come by, but you can start looking for neighbourhood telegram groups and advertising your service in them (if group rules allow).\n\nI apologise I do not have much options for you because your situation is different from mine due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI wish you all the best and I do hope that others have suggestions for you too!"

PUB usually cost 50 bucks, more during autumn-winter and summer. bunking into a hostel might cost more coz you get own room, with sharing amenities. \n\nyou're talking about culture. you gotta understand that it's depend on whom you're hanging around with. SGans tend to stick with SGans. few will break the circles and get friends with overseas students. different cultures, different habits. i can talk this for hours and will never end. in any case, it's pretty rare you will get to 'absorb' the local culture.  racism? one day if you're lucky, you will come across someone throw a remark 'true blue australian' in your face. sound familiar? yes. that's exactly what Singaporeans do to non Singaporeans here."

Black and white evidence from bank account, can get her for sure.\n\nMeanwhile, make sure friend has a safe place to go to, change all banking/HDB/singpass/email passwords to prevent further harm and can contact lawyers and authorities without sis finding out.\n\nCheck out charities for disabled people, they have advocates who can connect with lawyers, agencies, etc. Can stay with other people first if possible so sis won't abuse further, have better mental clarity to handle this rubbish mess.

There were quite a few such cases on HWZ for BlueSG where they parked improperly and dented the front bumper, and BlueSG charged them the full $3K or something excess even though the repair costs are nowhere as high. \n\nIf you wanna yolo, go for it.

My cousin just got a 2 door maserati apparently thanks to the extra money he got from sign-on bonus. Probably combine with whatever savings he and his wife has. They haven't considered that the income they both earn will likely be insufficient towards paying for their BTO and raising a kid, while being able to have sufficient income to save and live on after the big expenses come in.\n\nNot saying everyone is like that, but owning a car is still seen as a 'status symbol'. No reason to get one unless you can afford to or if the benefits the car provides are really great. Boyfriend's planning to just get a decent Hyundai so the commute to his future workplace (Gedong Camp) will be a lot less painful. For him its more than 30min~1hr time saved if he drives there one way, so it's something that can be considered vs buying expensive car for 'face'."

You can list by annual depreciation to suit your budget \n\nAdvice :\n1.  Don't go for high loans as it means you can't really afford it.\n\n2. Make sure you compare the interest rates . Currently  Maybank is offering 1.88% .  Some dealers will push for finance companies which charge much higher because you either have a bad credit report or your income does not satisfy MAS requirements. \n\n3. Unless your salary is high, refrain from buying a car so soon.  It will be a drain on your finances.   Unless you need it for your work otherwise you are just paying for it to be parked the whole day.\n4.  If you decide to proceed with the purchase make sure you ask for the car to be send for inspection.  You want o know how much money to set aside for repairs.\n."

You need to equip yourself with car insurance which can you can get online. Just learn on the go. Enjoy driving!"

                "comment": "a) Housing\na-1) Rent seems to be expensive, but I wonder if it is the same everywhere?\n\nOf course rent depends on so many factors: proximity to MRT (train) stations, size of flat, area, how new it is, whether it's a condominium or a public housing flat. \n\na-2) There seems to be two types - entire house for rent or partial house (some rooms)\na-3) I'm married so I want to live in a house that is fully occupied by us\na-4) I'm okay with a one bedroom house\n\nI could be wrong but I don't think I've come across a one bedroom house. The smallest ive seen is 2 bedrooms. \n\na-5) I'm also okay with 30 - 60 minutes of commute.\na-6) What localities should I search for houses? And what are the average rents there?\n\nDepends on where your office is gonna be. \nIn Jurong East, Bukit Batok area.. common room - 400-700 is my guess. Master bedroom - 800-1000. \nFor an entire two bedroom unit, maybe 1.8-2.2k. \n\na-7) Do I need to pay an advance for the house before moving in? Like paying 12 months of rent in advance which will be returned to me when I leave that house (It's a common practice in India)\n\nUsually just one month deposit that's returned to you when you leave. 12 months? If anyone makes you pay that, they're cheating you. \n\na-8) Is there any other cost apart from rent? (like apartment maintenance fee, etc)\n\nIf you stay in a condominium, you might need to pay maintenance. Consider whether you'll really need a condo with swimming pool and gym and stuff. \n\nb) Transportation\nb-1) Cars are very expensive and I don't think I'll be able to afford them\nb-2) How much does it cost you to commute in bus/train per month?\n\nPublic transport is cheap. One way travel, max max max $3 per way. Assuming 2 way, 6/day * 30 days = 180 (Of course you don't work 30 days a month). \n\nc) Groceries and household items\nc-1) We are two persons and we mainly buy vegetables, fruits and rice.\nc-2) We try to be frugal as possible\nc-3) What would I be spending on the above items?\n\nUh, I spend about 200/month on the groceries mentioned above for 2.\n\nd) Mobile, Internet, TV etc\n\nd-1) I need to communicate with my family and friends in India, what is the best way to do this?\nFacetime? Skype? Whatsapp? I use all of these. \n\nd-2) Is calling over mobile networks cheaper over apps like skype? What about incoming calls over mobile networks? Just trying to get an idea here.\n\nIncoming calls are free for most postpaid plans. \n\nd-3) How much does Internet cost for usage like browsing, youtube, skype etc (No heavy downloads)\n\nUnlimited broadband access - I think it's between 45-65/month, depending on your speed and duration of contract etc. \n\nd-4) I don't watch TV but I think I'll buy one for my SO. How much do Indian channels package cost?\n\nHmm check Starhub cable tv's site. If I remember correctly from a few years ago, you need to get basic package + hindi/tamil/other channels, about 9/channel. Maybe a total of 40/month for cable tv. \n\ne) What is a reliable website to calculate tax?\n\nIRAS\n\nf) Did I miss any other important expenses?\n\nEating out? Come on, new place, you gotta try new food! :) (And yes, you can find loads of veg food here if that's your concern. )"

I actually asked if rents differ significantly in different areas. For example rents in jurong east vs sentosa (random example)\n\n> Depends on where your office is gonna be.

Is it like multiple people sharing a house and they share the utilities/maintenance etc? Just wanted to confirm.\nAlso how does a condominium differ from public housing flats? \n\n> Eating out? Come on, new place, you gotta try new food! :) (And yes, you can find loads of veg food here if that's your concern. )\n\nYep, we do lots of eating out. But the prices at hawker centers looked affordable so I didn't ask. We'll also be going to parks and other areas.\n\nThanks again for your responses! :)\n\n"
