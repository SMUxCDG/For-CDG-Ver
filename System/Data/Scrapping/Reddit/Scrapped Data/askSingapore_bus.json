That is exactly the point I am trying to make, why should everyone have to suffer because of some idiots who intentionally light up right next to you (which I seriously doubt anyone with half a brain cell is gonna walk up next to you and blow smoke in your face). Because by that logic of banning all forms of smoking in order to resolve a small issue, we might as well ban stuff like Soda for causing diabetes, ban alcohol for causing public drunkenness etc. \n\nMy point is that it is absolutely absurd to outright ban everyone from smoking just because you don\u2019t smoke and you\u2019re not happy with those who do. I don\u2019t smoke, and I don\u2019t like to be subjected to second hand smoke either, but god damn it am I gonna stand up for the right and freedom of others to do so because it is their prerogative to do so. Banning this and that is nothing more than increased government authoritarianism, Singapore has enough of tyrannical laws already."

However, as you mentioned yourself, the issue is if we give exceptions to ppl who can make a right decision, then there will still be a group of ppl who can't make the right decision yet conduct in the same manner.\n\nI've seen ppl who light up their cigrattes when walking, but don't smoke as long as they are around ppl (why they want to \"burn\" money is another story). That, to a certain extend, is still acceptable.\n\nSmoking because you're unaware of ppl around you when you walk, not great but at the very least, you do try to be aware. \n\nSmoking and walking even when ppl is behind you or many ppl walking around? I think that's unacceptable.\n\nMy personal preference is I would prefer ppl to just stand and smoke. That way, at least its easier for ppl to avoid, or ppl can just walk faster for that few seconds.\n\nI can't judge if 2 to 3m is sufficient. It sounds sufficient, unless wind is blowing in an unfavorable direction"

But you know; vices be vices, and for many, smoking is a coping mechanism that we just stopped trying to get out of, because there's no longer a point in doing so.  \n\n\nAs smokers, walking while smoking gives us something to do with our hands (or oral fixation, if you subscribe to Freud). It's inherent for many of us, though we all have our own reasons for doing so. I walk while I smoke, yes, but I also cover my cigarette with hand so others don't see it, and the smoke is somewhat contained within my palm and wrist. Hey, learned something new didn't ya?  \n\n\n2m - 3m isn't exactly far enough. Even 5m (which the authorities use as its yardstick for bus stops and schools) isn't enough. Smoke has a way of finding its way around regardless.  \n\n\nAll that said, and as much as the thread here agrees with designated smoking corners and keeping the \"evil smokers\" away, allow me to present a different perspective, using the Orchard Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) as an example.  \n\n\nA) I've had a couple of friends commented (who are non-smokers), that this could be considered discrimination (or demeaning, even) against smokers. That is entirely up for debate.  \nB) I've a friend who was smoking at one of the Orchard DSPs when this individual and their child were staring at them, with the said individual stating to their child to never be like them while pointing at the smokers.  \n\n\nNow, I can agree with you that the majority of smokers make the rest of us look bad, but does it mean that someone like me (who has his own set of rules to abide by), should be subjected to the unnecessary wrath of OP and many of the commenters here, who have already sentenced me to damnation in the tiny heads of theirs? Ask yourself, is it right, or fair to me?"

                "comment": "Those protruding black sensors are part of a safety system called a driver warning system (or collision avoidance system). There are different variants currently in use here. \n\nIn its most basic form (the camera in front), it can alert the driver when he's getting to close to the car in front, can detect pedestrians in front, and can even read the speed limit signs and register it. \n\nMany new buses are fitted with more advanced ones (with those protruding sensors). Those can detect obstacles, cars, pedestrians, bicycles (this especially important) that are within the the bus's blind spot -- a bus is a very big vehicle, and those mirrors alone can't cover all angles, so there are certain spots on both sides of the bus that can't be spotted from the mirrors. \n\nIIRC some are also fitted with warning lights, so that if the bus is turning left, it will flash warning lights on left side and sound warning so that any cyclists or motorcyclists on the left of the bus can stay away. Again, there's blindspot, so there is always a risk of cyclists/motorcyclists being squashed by a left-turning bus. \n\nI heard that there's also a new sensor system that has a camera pointed at the driver's eyes and can warn him if the system suspects that he is dozing off."

It is really unfortunate that this has happened to u...  and to be honest, in this era, it might happen again, but here's what i advice.\n\nU can make a police report about this matter, but the followup matters will definitely take some of ur time. I cant promise the police will do much, other than give a stern warning. Maybe MP can help bcz it started to become has racist insults..\n\nYes, could have also approached the train staff regarding this issue, the person has clearly overstepped the boundary when words like \" slut \" / \" prostitute \"  and the part about removing the hijab comes out, that is a personal attack alrdy, no nid to show any more face to such ppl.\n\nYou are not wrong if u start secretly take video or on a voice recorder app too, it is evidence to prove that the person has really gone too far. Just dun post online without censoring the face(i really hate this new law)\nBUT u dunnid to censor the face for the original video when u submit as evidence to the police, although they can use their authority to identity by cctv by attire too.\n\nThere is also an option to show that u are a bigger person, ignoring them completely, by getting off the train especially if it is during peak hour and take the next one so u dun hab to take any insults, ur mental health is impt and next train is coming soon (~2 to ~4mins, old trains can be slightly slower, yes, stupid yearly budgets)\n\nThere are many 'crazy' ppl in sgp, which i like to believe due to stress from family or finance or friends / respect the elderlies and dun talk back culture imprinted to the current gen of elderly.\n\nFurthermore, the gov overpampering them with benefits and giving them titles of pioneer and merdeka made some of them feel that everyone is indebted to them.\n\nBUT, this does not give them (especially these boomers and pioneers) the right to do whatever they want including racist comments or insults !\n\nFrom my point of view, this toxic culture will stay for a while and we cant really get rid of it yet, with the gov is playing smart by acting blur to avoid overcommiting to this national issue."

Many school bullies came from unfortunate backgrounds... The school would have a better chance resolving the issue than the parents who have personal stakes and strong feelings to help their child. \n\nDon't force the two children to interact or even face each other, unless really needed. The victim tend to just want to avoid them. And the bully may feel that they have more reasons (e.g. shamed, undeserving overly harsh punishment at home/school) to continue the bullying.\n\nImportantly, talk with your kid. Take their emotions into consideration."

The straight out bully is actually the easiest because it's separating and counselling for them both. \n\nCannot sue in Singapore what. And you yell at the other parents or lay a hand on the kid, you will be in much more trouble. \n\nTalk to the teachers straight away to let them know. Ask that the school counselor also see the bully and talk to the bully's family. If they're not helpful go up to vice principal or principal to escalate. \n\nSome of the strategies we used was sitting the bully at a different area, making sure the child who is getting picked on has support from other kids, the teachers keeping a closer eye. During recess, the child would pair off with another friendly peer to stay away from the bully. \n\nFor the big kids hassling my small kid on the bus, I spoke to the bus uncle and aunty. When that didn't work well (the bullies would use words instead), I met the kids at the bus and told them in my stern stone face that I would call the school principal and make sure they all got detention and then they have to explain to their parents how they are picking on small children, how ashamed they will feel. The bullying slowed down a lot.\n\nI changed schools for one kid over bullying. The school counselor tried but the teachers were not helpful. The new school also has a classroom bully but the teachers are good about intervening and doing management for this kid's behaviour so my kid actually feels confident again. \n\nYour kid will encounter many bullies in their life. They need you to talk to the teachers and sometimes the other parents but most of all, they need you to teach them how to calmly and firmly handle such things. You can get picture books and books for older kids on bullying at the library."

I believe they have some protocol already in place that will involve the bullies' parents.\n\nThere are many reasons for bullying behaviors.

After all, if you stand near the entrance(the narrow corridor) you'll block the ppl coming in, if you stand at the back where the seats are you'l block those coming out, and you may not be able to stand in the middle(got people, normally there can be two rows, one leaning on the railing the other holding the hanging handles.\n\nI often do it, don't think i've gotten scolded for that at all, moderately full or not. \n\nIf the people who are scolding you were the ones who were seating down, don't bother listening to them unless they have a point. They're not the ones who need to find a place to stand after all.\n\nNormally there should only be one person near the exit, if got two that means the bus is almost at full capacity. If you're the only one and there's nowhere left to stand it's fine, try to position yourself as innerwards as possible. If got space then maybe just hold the handlebar and not go inside i think.\n\n\ntldr no problem in my eyes, as long as you make space for others to tap their card and stuff, and as long as there's not another person there with you. I know not getting scolded =/= is automatically ok, but for this one it's like scolding people who stand in the middle of the mrt train without moving in.\n\nofc if got other place to stand like the railing(the big space for wheelchair) then stand there better, but if \"moderately full\" then maybe no space then can.\n\nNot your fault, especially if you move away when ppl wanna exit. Some ppl just like to scold."

But the excitement I get when we\u2019re about to visit my parents and stay there for a couple of days\u2026 it\u2019s priceless!\n\nWe always FaceTime my parents every night without fail, catch up on the daily happenings before going to sleep. \n\nYou\u2019re just lucky that staying within a 15mins travel time near your parents is nothing. Cheer up and get ready to your new home.\n\nAlso, after work, you can always go to your parents house daily, have a cup of coffee, talk your heart out and leave in an hour to your home. THIS WAS THE IDEA I HAD IF I WERE TO BUY NEAR MY PARENTS, but we couldn\u2019t get one in our budget or liking.\n\nAnyways, all the best on your married life and stay happy"

What you\u2019re feeling is normal. We\u2019ve all been through it, even if to different degrees.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to look back at the previous chapters and reminisce. However, as you go through the years, you\u2019ll be faced with even harder reality, and you\u2019ll need to find a way to cope with such eventualities. Things like sickness and death to friends and extended family, job changes, and even the birth, growth and independence of your children. Eventually, you\u2019ll even bump up against your parents suddenly looking so old and even passing away. All of this will happen. You will find a way to cope. You must find a way to cope. Be strong for yourself, and be there for your loved ones as they will be for you. Good luck!"

I like to think he borrowed the toilet at the school nearby, but thinking about it now, that would have been more than 5 mins so I think he actually peed in some bushes. Interesting question though."

Eg. Trip Allw, Attendance Allw, Meal Allw, Transport Allw, etc.\n\nThey are expected to be able to perform OT. But with a relatively low basic salary, OT Allw is also proportionately low. Same applies for whatever bonuses they get.\n\nThey're also expected to work unholy hours (reporting to work at around 3am).\n\nQuite tiring, but manageable salary. \n\nThey usually stay for about 2-3 years, then switch over to logistics or other commercial transport providers.

When orchard was more popular at my time, we will often meet there and she takes the effort to travel down. Our couple time would be bus/train trip when i send her home before i head home.   \n\nOnce, after sending her back, i missed the last bus and train. Being a poor student, didnt have enough money to take a cab. So i just slept in the park, waited till morning to catch first train back."

                "comment": "Non-smokers need to address the issues of smokers, if you really want to curb second hand smoking. Most smokers, actually want to quit smoking, but have very little support. \n\nSmoking cessation programmes are not supported by any subsidy for NRT or Champix/Chantix medications, nor is smoking habits intervened with mental health support programmes. If you have attended any smoking cessation programme, you would realise how backward and rudimentary they are. Smoking is rarely seen as an addiction, like gambling, alcohol or drugs, which receives much greater support.\n\nOn the contrary, most OECD countries have smoking cessation mechanisms subsidised by the government or atleast included in their national health insurance plan. \n\nPerhaps most ironically, even without Govt subsidies, the retail price of Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Medications like Champix are most expensive in Singapore than elsewhere. You can get NRT at 1/3 the cost of buying it from Polyclinic Pharmacy, if you buy it from Amazon US or Amazon UK, shipment price inc.**I highly suspect, that Singapore actually tax NRT just like Cigarettes, since they contain nicotine, without considering that these are medical interventions which shouldn't be taxed. If so, I won't be surprised if Tobacco companies had influenced such a tax policy**\n\nSo given the above, instead of asking how much more can Singapore put in restrictive laws towards smoker, you should ask how much more supportive can the state be to those smokers who wants to quit. \n\nOnce you allow restrictive laws to penetrate into personal space, it opens up a Pandora box for other laws, like Police, Safe Distancing Officers, etc, to penetrate into your personal space with or without your consent.\n\nEdit: There is no such thing as collective power of smokers. If there was, we would have already gotten proper support for Smoking Cessation. **The reality is the collective power of Tobacco Companies.**"

There are not as much guidelines where people can or cannot smoke, it is more to do with whether your surrounding is okay seeing you smoke in front of them (and most people just say yes just because it is somewhat a norm). That\u2019s not even close to whatever i am experiencing in singapore.\n\nNot to mention that my home country don\u2019t have strict guidelines on vehicle\u2019s emission, so cars and buses can still run although their exhaust spitting out black smog.\n\nSingapore is still a paradise with rainbows and unicorns."

We don\u2019t count as \u2018students\u2019 and instead we pay adult fares for normal trips, though there exists a university concession card which gives you unlimited rides on bus, mrt or both at a cost of between 55-90.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re overstating the need for Mandarin lmao. Besides, cai fan isn\u2019t the only cheap food option if you search around. You should also allow for a bigger food budget (~500) since $5 meals don\u2019t exist everywhere.  \n\nRent budget is fine I think (maybe push it to 800 to be safe). I\u2019d suggest you stay in Paya Lebar/Dakota since they\u2019re on the Circle Line, same as Bras Basah (since from your posts you\u2019ll be going to SMU?). They\u2019re old but decent neighbourhoods with cheap food and the National Stadium/East Coast Park is not too far away if you want to just have a chill walk outside.\n\nPhone budget is ok. Might wanna increase your \u2018others\u2019 budget just in case? No need if you\u2019re confident about your spending.\n\nSo yeah the final budget comes up to 500+800+90+20+90=1500. Obviously you can go even lower than your own budget or higher than mine, but I think mine accounts for more unplanned stuff + better quality of life (necessary to counteract uni stress) so you could consider it."

                "comment": "Based on where you might be going to school, I think a good idea of where to rent is looking along the blue line (bencoolen), which is right underneath SMU. \n\nFrom tampines/bedok reservoir stn to school is literally only going to take you less than 30mins to school, which is rather fast by all accounts. \n\nStaying near the mrt is also a good way to save money for transport. Uni student has concession for mrt only, which is around $55. Assuming each trip costs $2, back and forth is $4, you just need to 'go out/school' for around 16 days to breakeven. So even on the weekends, if you go out, just take the mrt to your closest destination and walk wherever you need to go. This works out quite well for me and save a lot of momey (+ exercise too)\n\nIt can also be good since youre an international student to be exploring Sg easily on the mrt. \n\nSeeing that you are a woman, do avoid staying near places around Geylang area if you can. Not that it is super unsafe, but generally at night it could get a bit shady. This extends to as far as Eunos area. This comment could be a bit controversial but just my opinion. \n\nIn terms of food option, $5 per meal is decent for day to day - try to buy from hawker and food court to save money. U can save on breakfast money by buying a large loaf of gardenia bread and make it fancy by buying sliced ham. This can make breakfast cost to around $1 per day or so. \n\nOne thing to note is going out/entertainment on the weekend. This can easily get very expensive. A meal in a cheap restaurant will cost easily $15 upwards. And a movie on the weekend is around $10 iirc. So do factor those in as well."

If you are going to use WiFi most of the time at home or in school, then you can actually cut that $20 down even further by going for the $10 for 6Gb plan. They have rollover data for 2 cycles so if you are not a heavy user, you can have double the data in the next month.\n\nIf you find that its too low, then try to wait for Giga's pop-up promos which happens usually during special events or holidays, then upgrade to get the $18 for 50Gb plan. \n\nHowever, that also depends on where you are staying cos Giga is under Starhub and their coverage is rather spotty in some areas like where I stay.. I get like only 1 bar in my house and 2 bars if I move close to the window. Their internet speeds are pretty good though.\n\nThe other alternative is TPG Mobile that offers $10 for 50Gb but I've no experience with them and I do have some concerns about their mobile coverage in Singapore. They have their own network. \n\nIn any case, these SIM-only plans have no contract, so you are free to switch after a month or so.. do read the fine prints in case there is a clause for early termination.\n\nFinally, DO NOT buy pre-paid cards... they are a complete rip-off IMO.\n\nOn transport, its really not too expensive to move around here. If you stay in the heartlands, the rent will probably be cheaper too.\n\nHope the above helps!"

Furthermore, SG's pretty small and commuting wouldn't be that long.\n\nFood: I think $5 per meal is pretty okay for hawker food but that means no drinks, nice dinner or meals in the city. You'll have to live on a strict diet. As for pricing, most hawkers have a large menu on their signboard or pasted on their stall. If you were to stay in the hearlands, it can be about $3-4 per meal at hawker centres.\n\nPublic transportation: there are no discount fees for anyone after high school so you should assume paying for adult fares. Fares are about $2 per trip (or slightly less). To and fro school would be $4 and for 31 days in a month, it would be $124. You can save by taking the MRT before 7:45 am where there is a $0.50 discount. \n\nPhone: $20 is possible. You can try Gomo which uses the infrastructure of the largest telco operator (Singtel). Have been using it for some time and so far there was no issue with receptions or any other issues. I've not manage to hit the 20GB (they sometimes give bonus data) mainly bcos work/study from home and availability of wifi everywhere around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can drop me a message if need be!"

This would save the hassle of topping up the prepaid card + save some admin costs from applying. Some cards do have cashback for public transports so you can look that up!\n\nPhone: You can try the personal finance site 'Seedly' to look at reviews on the various plans! Sometimes there are some promotions for various merchants. There are some telegram chatgroups which you can consider joining for the occasional discount codes/promotions (usually for food).\n\nEdit: saw the above comment on $55 for MRT only. You can take that up if it's available and makes financial sense to you. But that wasn't available for me I think, there was only the hybrid (bus+mrt) which costs >$100."

Escaping from one is hell of a lot harder than going into one pre covid. \n\nFor HDB, the general belief of safe security in sg is what allows relaxation of security around the neighbourhood. Similar to landed areas in sg area. No real security except a few cctv around the lamp posts. \n\nThe only place that really has security in sg for residentials are condos, which frankly does not much for enforcement as well. They are there to create that facade of security than actually enforcing it. I mean cmon, if you have seen those uncles, I bet they really cannot outrun a young adult if they really keen on committing a crime. \n\nBut yeah its a bit contradictory"

The former have school uniforms while the latter (save for ITE) do not. It would be hard to differentiate outsiders from students in the latter, hence no point\n\n2. While you may argue that ITE/poly students are the same age as jc students and hence the same level of protection should be offered, then my answer is, not really. JCs only admit students fresh out of O\u2019lvls (17-18 yr olds). ITE and polytechnics, in addition to the aforementioned group, also admits working adults who wish to upgrade themselves. And again, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to differentiate a working adult from an intruder. Hence, not practical. \n\nHope this offers some insights as to why things are done the way they are. Of course this is not an official statement from the gov, just my thoughts. Happy to discuss"

We are brought up largely to be told to stay away from danger and avoid getting involve into trouble with others, this sadly did not consider the need to stand up against what is wrong. The good news is things are gradually changing. More and more people from the younger generation are standing up against others' wrongdoing. But this will take sometime before it becomes common in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, do stay safe and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Bus Drivers are trained to handle such situation. If you feel that you are being harassed in a bus, you can walk up to the bus driver and inform him about the situation. The driver has a specific SOP to follow when such situation arises. Similarly, any public areas, if you found yourself to be in danger, ask for help from a stranger, walk quickly towards a service counter and tell them about it. Someone will be there to help you."

I agree that Singaporeans are largely very non-confrontational, and when most people are still processing what is going - many will not come forward to express an opinion or will simply look on with much curiosity. (Harassment in public occurs very rarely, based on my observations..so maybe everyone was very uneasy and unsure about how best to react.) I do think there are still, however, opinionated and deeply compassionate people in Singapore. As an Asian I had experienced racist verbal abuse or unsolicited yellow fever advances several times when I was living overseas; and nobody spoke up or came to my defence...(except one very kind British old man), so I\u2019m sorry to hear. I remembered thinking \u201cmaybe they just saw me as the minority and foreigner, and could not empathise, or they were unable to perceive how uncomfortable I am because of cultural differences\u201d. I know that if I were there and saw your discomfort, I\u2019d have spoken up for you - especially if you were a foreigner"

I was clearly struggling with him and his schoolbag, trying to lift him off the floor with the bus still moving.\n\nAt this point, I was panicking and all the people around me were just looking. It made me furious actually. I shouted across from the back of the bus to stop the vehicle. I asked very loudly to the person in front of me to help me carry him out of the bus and even then he hesitated to help. \n\nOut of 30~ people in the bus,\nNobody helped to ask the driver to stop the bus.\nNobody helped to carry him out of the bus.(until I shouted at that one person)\nNobody helped to carry his schoolbag out of the bus. \nNobody helped to call an ambulance.\nNobody even offered to help.\nIt was like I wasn\u2019t even there. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with our upbringing.

However, my story has a good end thanks to kind samaritans. \n\nImagine it's the morning rush hour. People fill the bus at every stop. You got the side view seat and start to daydream while looking outside the window. Then you get this eery vibe (spider-sense!) and turn to see a man that looked like he was in his twenties facing your direction. He just stares at you with a fixed expression. Seconds become minutes and the uncomfortable reality sets in that he was doing it purposefully. The intentions remain unclear, and yet it feels threatening. When you try to hide your face behind a person, he moves just slightly to his left to get a clear view of... you. You can feel his eyes piercing through you as you struggle in the seat to find a haven. Luckily for you, an SIA flight attendant came on the bus and has gotten a gist of what was happening. She blocks the view, only to realise the view has now changed to her. Tension rises when she realises she was the next target. Fortunately, a muscular man, despite being slightly shorter, stood in between her and the perv. He had noticed what was happening and stepped in. That's when the perv gave up and turned away. A while after, he alights from the bus and the stressful tension instantly vanishes. Phew! Shoulders around me relax, and that's when I realised I wasn't alone. The hero and heroine now stood in a more relaxed posture, and so did the \"bystanders\". \n\nI was really glad that this crowd was filled with good and brave people. Please don't lose hope OP, know that good people still exist in Singapore! I believe, at difficult times, Singaporeans will not hesitate to lend a helping hand. I sincerely hope you won't experience smt this terrible ever again. #SGStayUnited"

People used to be more outspoken about things. Kids used to get scolded on the bus when they're rowdy/noisy. Everyone's always so scared nowadays. I'll never support that mentality. \n\nBut on behalf of Singaporeans the nation round, I'm sorry. Just remember that if you can prove he took pictures, you can call the police on him. The PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) applies to every Singaporean. No one is allowed to take your photo without your consent or ask for your IC card anymore (unless needed for verification purposes, usually by hospitals or government institutions)."

Singapore is a benchmark when it comes to women\u2019s safety (probably better than your mine country even), with women able to travel alone even post midnight on their own. It is not a norm but an exception. God forbid it happens again, the best idea would be to record him recording you, and submit evidence to police, instead of directly confronting him. Hope you get over this incident soon! \n\nOne other thing. People not interfering in someone else\u2019s affairs (including incidents like these) is a cultural thing. As many people said already, most of the people here avoid such situations, doesn\u2019t mean they are coward or so. Hence i would request you to please do not call any nationality/ society coward, trying to give them learning about how they were brought up, because of one incident. \n\nTaken care and stay safe!!"

I can go from sengkang to IKEA tampines in just a few short bus stops, go to Changi Airport with a straight bus, go to the central area with a straight train without needing to transfer lines etc. If you're a cycler or someone who likes nature, there's the Sungei Serangoon Park Connector which connects to Coney Island, Punggol Waterway Park, Punggol beach and you can cycle to Pasir Ris Beach if you want to go really long distance. There are also many cinemas in the northeast region and many places to eat cheap food. The northeast is more of a family area to raise kids and such so the bar/club scene isn't really prominent. There are a couple of nice open bars at the Punggol Container Park, but I haven't gone to any of them yet. \n\nSomething that is really appealing to me is the convenience of the location. It definitely isn't central-area convenient, but transport wise it is very connected. There's 2 LRTs that serve the west and east side of sengkang, plus many buses that service the sengkang area. I have an LRT station and a bus stop right in front of my house so I really don't have to do much walking. I'm not a driver but there are many major highways in sengkang too, which makes it convenient if you're travelling to the other side of sg."

                "comment": "What u can do in sengkang is honestly not much. I've gotten pretty bored of both compass 1 and seletar mall. Both malls offer very little amenities and mostly have food related stalls and restaurants (not like they are also have good anyway) but the ramen hitoshi has one of the better ramens tho their soup is on the richer side. \n\nAll sengkang peeps be it old or young will tell you JALAN KAYU IS TRASH especially their \"famous\" roti prata which has now very much dropped in standard and taste even worse than those at the hawker stall. Heads up there aren't any? Or VERY little malay stalls here so I'm always deprived of a warm mee soto on a raining day\ud83e\udd72 \n\nThe parks here ARE pretty solid and well connected. Depending on where u stay, I stay on the west of sengkang, u can easily head to wwp which is around a 20mins cycle which can bring you to pasir ris also past the lorong halus Bridge. U can also head to ecp or yishun tho I haven't figured out the route there yet. There also very little buses imo and the main mode of transport around here is the lrt. Most ppl usually head to WWP at punggol cause jts honestly HUGE and there's a bunch of shopping experience.\n\nThe punggol container is fine, just know what to eat. The mookata there is overhyped and over priced so it's a no go for me honestly. Pretty crowded over the weekends during the night so take note. Seleter Aerospace has been said by many to be unique and the cafes there are pretty good especially the one with pizza. \n\nHas this become a rant post? Definitely LOL but all in all sengkang is really not a bad place especially with the new community centre that's being built right outside seletar mall. It's only fun if you put in the effort, and sk is a great place to chill and relax anyway. Definitely hope you'll enjoy sk like most ppl here :)"

Idk if taxi that happened to overtake the bus hit me or if i got shocked and tripped backwards\n\nThe next min my knees elbows and toes were bleeding and my head was spinning. Taxi uncle was clearly flustered and a nice lady asked me for my mom phone number\n\nI was scared my mom will scold me so I  said nvm I will walk home cuz it was 2 min away. Lady convinced the 11y/o i will go home(cuz I was clearly not in a sane state of mind). Called my mom and ambo. Took me to kk. \n\nLuckily went hospital cuz turned out I had hit my head so hard my brain hit my skull. Had internal bleeding and NSFW warning: vomited blood, nose bleed and ear bleed. My mom fainted when she saw that while i was like \"damn that is so cool\". \n\nWas in high dependency for 3 days. Dr said can stay somemore but i macho so i rested over the weekend. For the next 6 months, i had to take the lift and couldnt do strenuous exercise like PE cuz Dr. wanted my brain to recover from the shock.\n\nThe whole time i was more worried abt hospital bill and my parents' reactions and i cried and told them i will pay them. They were like wtf, girl u just got low key brain damage and u r worried abt us!! I mean for the next 5 years, that was my family's emotional attack against me haha(not in a toxic way, in a joking, tough love way) but after Os I got a job and offered to pay them back. They didn't take the money but since I had offered the financial cost of my mistake, they actually stopped constantly bugging me abt it.\n\n\nLesson of the day for me was: you wanna do smtg wrong, do it properly. . Cuz after that day, i continued to Jay walk(yea I know, i almost killed myself and ended a taxi driver's career) but was much much more careful. Taxi driver was rly nice enuf to not scold me or take any legal action even tho there was a small bump on his taxi and i oso obv didn't report him to TP(altho had to make statement and admitted it was my fault, idk what was the penalty or if there was but yea....I guess i have a TP case?)\n\nTill this day, if i ever wanna die, i think back to that day. I had almost died but didnt  so obv smtg in the universe or whatever philosophical BS will not allow me to die so yea..."

Been in your shoes only a day ago myself! I'm on mobile right now so I can't link you the exact thread, but you can look up for the latest quarantine related thread on the sub or mh profile. A few people, myself included, have shared our experiences there dor your reference. But to generally sum them up:\n\n- If they know your details, it's an authentic call. It should also start with 6xxx xxxx. You can always double confirm by calling up MOH and checking if the phone number is legit! \n- An official SMS should drop soon. Next morning, very likely.\n- Pack a luggage in case! IIRC some people actually get to choose where to quarantine (home vs hotel) but in case you don't get to choose, prep approximately 5 sets of clothes, your hygiene products and entertainments. I think that as long as you weren't present at any cluster hotspots (Westgate and SP for example) you should get to choose? \n- For those with the liberty to choose, a cisco officer will drop by to check out your house to determine if its suitable for home quarantine. Otherwise, you get shepherded to a hotel. No exact timing for their visits, but they will call you in advance before they arrive.\n- Official paperwork for your parents' reference should be with the visiting cisco officer or your chauffer.\n- You will need to download an app called Homer and record your temperature 3 times a day in it. They're pretty strict about this so set alarms if need be!\n- Thermometers will be given to you for free. But uh, the one I got was in farenheit so maybe you're better off using your own...\n\nQO in general is very, very boring because you can NOT leave your house/hotel room at all. So if you're the outgoing type, you need to steel yourself for a lot of inactivity. Otherwise, it just feels like you're lepaking."

With no estimated timing or date given as to when somebody will show up.\n\nOur problem with this was that they also told us on the first day that if someone is coming to pick my dad up, they will call 1 hour before arriving.\n\nSo my Dad kept waiting and the wait was unbearable because we were all expecting a phone call.\n\nAfter the firs two days passed with not a single peep, we started calling MOH emergency hotline and the number cisco used to call us repeatedly. \n\nHis QO suppose to end on Saturday. \n\nWe did receive a video call from a mobile number on that morning where he did a temperature check with the person (apparently a guy from MOH) and was told that his QO is over.\n\nSo I decided to call MOH to double confirm cuz he hasn't done a single Swab. Nobody came to pick him up for a Swab Test and we were worried that he may have covid because he mentioned having sore throat and was coughing occasionally.\n\nWe were then told his QO cannot end without doing a Swab Test by MOH emergency hotline people.\n\nSo we were very confused.\n\nWe tried calling the mobile number that did the video call earlier but it went to voicemail, lol.\n\nSo I started repeatedly calling MOH and Cisco to ask for an answer before emailing directly to some dude that sent the SMS regarding his trace together data and the next day, a swabber suddenly showed up at our home to do a Swab for him.\n\nIt was a series of confusing events tbh.\n\nLuckily his result is out and its negative so my dad can finally go back to work."

I promise they're not insurmountable. when I feel myself start to freak out and anxiety begins to take over, I force myself to stop and think - what's the worst that could happen? is it really as bad as it seems? what other ways can I view this where I'm  not locked towards one view point? what are some small steps I can do to make it better and maybe avoid another episode?\n\nregarding your june 16 appt - you should go. what's the worst that could happen? you get a shitty doc and your problem doesn't get resolved. that just means you can find another doc that might connect with you better, listen to you more, care for you more. \n\nanxiety is great at bundling problems and non-problems together and making it seem huge and immediate and world-ending. I promise it's not, they're generally smaller problems just that we lack ways to cope with it and it ends up snowballing and feeling unsolvable.\n\nyou'll be ok bro, if not now then eventually."

You can view more properties to rent on property guru or 99.co. These are the more reputable sites to source for property and it's a good gauge of market value for sure.\n\nSingapore has everything so I'd suggest for you to pack clothes only (SUMMER clothes and maybe just a few light sweater/cardigan) and maybe your favourite appliances (hairdryer) and makeup/must have toiletries... But the rest can literally be bought here. Don't sweat the small stuff like your hangers and toothbrushes etc. \n\nIf you're staying at JE it's going to be very convenient for shopping anyway.

It also gives you a more local vibe and security is not an issue here.\n\nDefinitely explore the small shops within housing estates here. You can buy a lot of the things you may need laundry baskets, racks, storage etc for quite cheap. Alternatively we have ikea if you need big items."

Get an agent to do all the work for you and guide you through the process. Many people say you don\u2019t need an agent, however as an ex pat, and with a company providing a relocation bonus, I\u2019d say it was money well spent.\n\nAnd just again on the furniture and what to bring side of things, just bring clothes and some small momentos.

It\u2019s something you need to get used to traveling on the public transport system with a folding bike. Also, there are different types of folding bikes which would make it easier for you to travel around with, such as the trifold ones like brompton, 3sixty, pikes as compared to bifold ones like dahon, fnhon, camp, java etc. However the trifold ones cost more. \n\nPersonally it would be easier to travel on trains as compared to bus as there\u2019s more space on trains. I would recommend getting a 14-inch that is small and lightweight for your 8-year old which he should be able to push it on his own. Alternatively, you can consider getting a bicycle bag for you to carry it instead while pushing your own."

I like planning route that ends at the beginning of mrt line so cfm have place to put. Cycle anywhere n end at marina bay for example.\nHas seen father n son 2 folding bikes going into bus on saturday evening. Father carried the bikes in via middle bus door just like wheelchair.\nEasiest bike to bring mrt is those china bikes with a triangle stand right under the seat. What we do is just fold mid frame once, no need to fold handlebar and push thru mrt. We have 16 and 20 inch. For brompton 3sixty style the cons is we have to keep an eye on it at all time due to expensive, so cannot just lock outside n go buy groceries or something, so really gotta plan route and pit stos properly.\nCarousell is your best bet for 3sixty, 900 to 1400. Make sure try and see if u comfortable in term of cycling position. We find 3sixty straight handle uncomfortable due to short arms and upgrade $50 to M bar."

Usually you return the same way you get in, via company transport. There is a public bus service but that is very infrequent. Strongly would not recommend walking.\n\n3. Once again depends on which company you are at. Some companies have their own canteen. Some have transport to the food centre on the island (Oasis). Most times people just drive there or drive out.\n\n4. Get ready to pay advance booking fees of $8 if you intend to have a taxi pick you up from inside the island. Oh and don't get stuck at the checkpoint and miss your company bus (you have to disembark and clear the checkpoint like customs lol but far less crowded and much simpler)."

Here\u2019s what I know:\n\n1. at least 20min depends on traffic, especially peak hour jam along AYE. Jurong island itself is very big, could take some time to reach your destination depending how far in it is.\n\n2. There are bus 715, 716, 718 going to different area of JI. Charges $2.50 each trip. They go to and from bus stop next to Westgate, you could google Jurong island bus.\n\n3. I only knew there\u2019s a public canteen at Sakra Oasis. There\u2019s a Starbucks and Indian restaurant next to it too.\n\n4. Public transport is a challenge in JI, frequency is every 30min and it doesn\u2019t cover 11am-4pm I think. Try not to be late and missed your company bus. There\u2019s no problem into JI with taxi because there\u2019s a taxi lane at gantry for them to change temporary pass. Coming out will be difficult if there\u2019s no taxi in JI, like after 3pm when very few people going in."

PHV cannot enter jurong island unless they personally had island pass. if you are late for work either u endure the very subpar public bus service, or you take a cab in."

                "comment": "Commute time for me is about an hour. 2 hours to and from work.\n\nPersonally there is a difference between priority and importance. While the duration of commute is important to you, it is definitely not a priority for your first job. The nature and motivation levels towards what you are going to embark on should take precedence. If you are fully engaged and interested in your job, I can guarantee you travelling 2-3 hours in total to and from work won't be an issue. The same can be said for the opposite. You can have a walking distance commute but if you find your job worse than rolling in a pig sty, it's still going to be a torture.\n\nGranted there may be reasons you need to shorten your commute time (reach home to do your other stuff, look after someone etc) , however that should generally not be the most important factor for work life.\n\nHaving worked for almost 2 decades and about 4 companies to date, i can say anything more than 90mins per journey is considered long. It's made worse if you manage to leave during rush hour (where transport frequency is faster) and still take 90min at least to reach home or work."

I don\u2019t like doing it as it disrupts traffic but with so many dangerous drivers in SG there\u2019s little choice. \n\nIf you\u2019re a driver, please pass cyclists safely, don\u2019t try and squeeze by, you gain nothing and endangers the cyclist. \n\nCyclists that bike side by side or ignore red lights though f. them traffic rules are for everyone."

First, I would explain that Jaywalking is ok when people are too far from the crossing.\n\nIf she says that it's still wrong and builders should put up fences, you can change topic by saying \"ohhh if I could, I would make fences out of chocolate, then if I'm hungry I can take a bite\" so you bring the focus away from the jaywalking. Maybe she will counter with something about too many ants or it will melt then you can start talking about insects or the sun etc.\n\nGenerally at this age, you can distract quite successfully.\n\nSource: I also have a talkative 4 year old, and sometimes I get so fed up when she says \"but...

Bills are:\n\n1gb/s internet+ all the TV channels+ 2 mobile phones =~$300 month\n\nCleaner, 4 hours day/ twice a week = $520\n\nUtilities- air con on 24/7 = $225\n\nHealth insurance- $0 if your on an employment pass your employer has to cover this. Usually covers souse and children as well. \n\nTakeaways- for one person a steak, curry, pizza etc usually between $20-30 a time\n\nGroceries for 2- really depends what you eat. I probably stop off at the supermarket twice a week and spend about $75 a time. Beer, bacon, sausages, cheese, hand etc are quite expensive and usually start around $10 each, beer starts at about $15/4 pack, bottle of cheap wine starts around $25\n\nGym memberships - in the city prob closer to $100 month, out of town about $60 month\n\nTaxis- depend on time of day, if your lucky a 5 min ride not peak hour could be $8, a 15 min ride during peak times could be $30+ \n\nMRT/bus- depends how far but never usually more than $2\n\nSide note: Marina Bay and Orchard are overrated. If you\u2019re willing to go 15 min drive out of the city on ECP/AYE in either direction you\u2019ll get twice the space or pay half the cost."

(for family of 5 tho)\nFood - $5 and above at least (in CBD area)\nMRT/bus - depends on station (there's a fair calculator online), but a gauge for the MRT 7 stops is about $1.50\nTaxi - we use grab mostly, ranges from $7 - $20, I would say $15 is the average but peak period can shoot up to $30+\nInternet - errr you gotta look this up but search singtel/starhub/m1/others\nMaid - depends on if you want the stay in one's or the ones that come and clean up at a certain time for fixed hours but idk the price sorry, a few hundred\nHealth insurance - also ranges from the tens to hundreds depending on coverage\nBills - I would say less than $100 for water and electricity each\nGym membership - depends on gym, $100+\n\nI tried\n\nEdit:sorry formatting sucks I'm on mobile"

Assuming family of 4-5, average restaurants range from 50sgd to 200sgd per meal, hawkers probably less than 30sgd. Groceries from cheap supermarkets like Sheng shiong can be around 300-400sgd per month but usually expats go to Cold Storage or Marketplace and it\u2019s much more expensive. A decent 3-4 room condo in downtown be around 4-5k sgd, car (mpv or suv) anywhere from 150k to 350k depending on brand, usually 3-5k sgd per month including insurance/taxes/petrol, also greatly depends on if new car or not. If using public transport, way way cheaper. \n\nUr budget of 16k is way more than enough to cover basic living expenses considering our median wage is around 4-5k, but if u wanna enjoy in Singapore it\u2019s a different story"

Traveling with them to Ipoh, I was less pleased, but this was due to timeliness and route, not comfort. I find the overnight buses incredibly comfortable, but I can't speak to their daytime offerings.\n\nThis popular, well-regarded offerings typically come at a premium (although it's not extortionate), so if you're traveling on a shoestring, you may consider cheaper competitors. I haven't avoided them out of safety concerns, just prefer the comfort and consistency when available."

Its also safer to stand still then moving towards the door while the bus is moving.

If this were not the case, coverage of events, public security, street photography, or even selfies that accidentally capture other people in the background will not be possible. I believe a public bus falls under public space. So to answer your question, it is perfectly legal to take photos/videos of you in public despite how violated you feel.\n\nHaving said that, you do have some right to how your photos could be used. For example, the photo could not be used for an ad, or a clear commercial use. In this case, your consent is definitely required. The old man is perfectly allowed to appreciate your photos for his own pleasure or post them anywhere even.\n\nI think you may only have a case of harassment if this old guy is stalking you."

The PDPA allows for individuals to be photographed either in (i) personal settings (e.g. photos between friends) (ii) in a public space, considering it\u2019d be impossible to seek everyone\u2019s permission in the frame of a photograph. \n\nBut the law may have gaps (and the law is often substantively unsatisfying), there definitely is a lacuna with respect to non-consenting parties and photography. What you could do, and I\u2019ve done this before, is to scare the shit out of the person by calling out his actions to the whole bus/train. At this point, you can even bring it to the attention of train staff or the bus conductor and give him a run for his deviancy. \n\nAlternatively, you could consider innovative solutions like returning the favor and filming him, but these are more innovative means of recourse and to your discretion. \n\nTl:dr, unlikely to have criminal implications but could nonetheless take non-legal steps to make sure his balls go up his throat."

Even if this video is monetized on Youtube, you won't get into any trouble.\n\nLet's say you choose to interact with them and they are speaking to the camera. I would argue there is implied consent. So you will unlikely get into any trouble. Monetized channel or not. However........... a big however....\n\nHowever, if someone is appearing on camera, it is simply a good idea to have a release form signed, just to reduce the risk of being sued. Especially if they discover afterwards they dislike your edit, or your video, or felt aggrieved one way or another.\n\nIf the videos/photos taken in public spaces are not used clearly for commercial purposes, you should be okay without obtaining consent. An example of misusing videos/photos of unconsenting individuals is to portray them as promoting a brand, a product or a service. You will definitely need consent in this case.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer so I apologise if I am wrong. I am just sharing what I understand to be the case. So anyone with a legal background please correct me if necessary. Thanks."

Many years back when I was still a student, I used to study in a public library with my classmates and our usual uniform was of course fbt shorts and t-shirts. One day I felt like I was being followed at the bookshelves area and from the corner of my eye I could see a freaking CAMERA pointing at my direction. To cut story short, my friends reported to the librarian and the librarian caught the guy, checked his camera to find thousands of photos of females in shorts in the library - some were just explicitly leg photos. By then I was shaking and crying I can\u2019t explain why but I felt really harassed and disgusted (at that guy and myself of course, for wearing shorts). Librarian called the police and counselled me to make a report and the police did take our statements etc too. Not sure what happened to the guy but we did not get any follow up updates after that. I think they did say it\u2019ll be recorded against the guy so if he makes any offence again they might charge him? Shrugs"

Looking forward to greater southern waterfront. Always, always windy. \nTB Con: humidity will cause wood to mould and metal to rust at a faster than normal rate. Windy means dusty. Marketing options are limited. \n\nKH pro: a lot of amenities and cheap as it is a built up residential estate. Marketing options aplenty (Keat hong, Teck Whye etc) \nKH con: LRT is crap most people take bus. Cck is damn far from civilisation. Sometimes got chicken shit smell from the Lim Chu Kang farms (not often maybe 1-2 a year and after many years you\u2019ll get used to it). \n\nHonestly, it really comes down to what are your priorities (cost? High floor? Is Marketing convenience a problem or you can just order delivery? Do you drive? Proximity to workplace? Value appreciation? Etc) Older flats have maintenance issues too. It may look good renovated but you can\u2019t see water leakage etc just from a couple of visits. I\u2019ll also suggest you talk to neighbours and find out why the owners are selling. \n\nSeparately, accepting grants would also mean you\u2019ve no intention of reselling cuz otherwise you\u2019d have to payback yourselves."

If you\u2019re buying to stay for long (at least 10-15 years) then TB is really a great estate in the Long run and everything about real estate is location, location, location. Although I\u2019d like to caution that cost and values are very different concepts. Only you can tell if 710k is worth paying. \n\nIf you have intention to resell soon (~5 years), you\u2019ll prob not see much appreciation for either. The KH unit is a new MOP flat and the appreciation has been priced in for a far-flung location. Would suggest u look for more."

There will come a point you'll be earning more than you need to survive. Kind of provides you a comfortable life.\n\nThe cost of living does not stay stagnant and is constantly rising, that's why people look down on people who don't educate themselves and stay content with jobs that kind of pay minimum wages.\n\nYou really can't compare Singapore with big countries like Japan and Australia. These are big countries where people earning less can always retreat to the rural areas where the cost of living is cheaper."

I don\u2019t speak for everyone but I just get very awkward and find such greetings disarming. I think in Singapore, we only make small talk to people we know, not so much to strangers. \n\nI was in the US for four months and they would always make such small talk, no matter if you were going into a shop or getting into an Uber.  They\u2019d ask how I was or how I was doing. But once I reply with: \u201cGood, and you?\u201d, they\u2019d reply that they were good too. But there wouldn\u2019t be any indication to continue the conversation. It was just small talk, it didn\u2019t mean they were interested in knowing anything about me. It was a necessity in the culture of American small talk. I\u2019d like to think in Singapore when we make small talk, at least we actually want to know about the people we\u2019re talking to. Not saying the same can\u2019t be true elsewhere. \n\nBut hey, if you\u2019re saying such things to staff as you leave shops, it\u2019s still a nice thing to do. So, you do you! Even if it\u2019s weird, it might still make someone\u2019s day."

Chill out , have breakfast , talk nonsense , play some games. Even if im early for only 15 minutes i just enjoy goofing off in the morning when everyone is so tired and zombie-ish. LOL. \n\nBut of course i was late once in awhile also, but ah well. Also had detention from time to time lol. I just take it as time to do my homework and zone out. No need to deal with naggy parents, save money from going out with friends, watching my pretty schoolmates walk by. Take a nap if i can. Read comics lol.\n\nLol i guess i dont take punishment so seriously, i just play by the rules and enjoy myself."

(Some i chose to sleep \"abit more\") Teacher in charge didnt believe me also. \n\nLike one time my bicycle tyre literally punctured and the bicycle was right there. Infront of the teachers eyes. After that i took the bus most of the time . Cycle sometimes. \n\nI was upset at first. Then later i just let it go. At the end of the day I chose to make use of the time at detention to finish homework, read comics and chillout. When i got home I booted the pc and played games. \n\nMy parents were impressed i completed work before dinner LOL. Almost got my ass whooped for being caught playing games after dinner. I usually wait till last minute . Sometimes next morning. \n\nThese kinda things happen all the time. What you make of it is ultimately your choice. But nothing good comes out of being upset about it, take a step back and look at the full picture."

The rest of the stretch? No possibility of people randomly shooting out onto the road into oncoming traffic.\n\nPerhaps a further improvement would be to turn it into a signalled crossing altogether, but what you've described actually improves safety by a bit on its own."

                "comment": "It is difficult, if not impossible to tag a person as potentially having COVID-19 but yet in a non-discriminative way out in the public. If they were to cab/Grab home, which driver will want to fetch them? Are they going to spend more time in public since no drivers want to pick them up? If they don't have a car and take public transport, will they be STOMPed and shamed online as socially irresponsible?\n\nIf we tag the person by smartphone and alert other users nearby (such as thru an app), it could cause unnecessary alarm: 1) the suspect case may turn a negative test 2) false perception of being at risk of infection - for eg., if someone commutes in a bus and a someone in a car nearby 'rings' the bus commuter's smartphone, the commuter may think that s/he is potentially exposed in the bus, even though that is clearly not the case.\n\nSo the benefits of the public being aware of potential exposure are not worth the costs of the individual having difficulty getting home in the first place and thus spending more time in public (which actually risks exposing more ppl), of the individual being publicly shamed (giving incentive to individual to remove tagging and resulting in compliance issues) and of the societal costs of false alarms\n\nEdited for clarity"

This could deter them from going for early checkups when they suspect they are infected. If we keep them in a hospital ward while waiting for results, it could chope up the beds and might also increase the risk actually contracting the virus too.\n\nBut if the tags are used on people who have mandatory stay home order, they work best!"

The actual train ride takes no more than ten minutes and will cost you SG$5. You just need to figure out how to get to the train station.

That will count as TWO rides.\n\nSo to avoid that, we must use the same phone same model (so make sure your phone is charged if you are using Apple/Samsung/google pay) to start and end and transfer."

Food delivery apps would be foodpanda, grab food and deliveroo. Your usual Google maps for getting around sg through public transport, don't trust the bus timings though, they're usually really inaccurate, use MyTransport. \n\nI'm also not sure about burple beyond, but some great hawker centres in Singapore would be Newton food centre (note they're only open at night & that some vendors may try to cheat your money (only 1 or 2 though)) or East Coast Park food lagoon. If you're planning on buying groceries try cold storage or NTUC. ntuc's usually cheaper.\n\nNot sure if this would help but although cash payment as well as credit card payment is widely accepted in Singapore, some vendors would offer you the chance to pay them through paylah or alipay etc.\n\nI think that's it, if you have any further questions you can always reach me through my inbox, have a great time in Singapore!"

This is especially true since you & your family will not be eligible for citizen subsidies especially pertaining to healthcare, childcare etc. The $6k minimum is there for a reason. \n\nWhile your wife is technically supposed to find a job first before entering Singapore, it is not uncommon for foreigners to attend job interviews on a tourist visa. In your wife's case, she has a legitimate reason for entering Singapore: to help you with the move to Singapore. There's just nothing stopping her from going for a few job interviews too. But of course, she **cannot** tell immigration she is here to look for a job; that's an instant denial of entry. \n\nIf the job search goes well, she can look into converting the tourist visa into a work permit. Or else, she can return home first to sort out the paperwork, then fly back into Singapore on the work permit."

In fact, if you do move here by yourself, a good way to keep living expenses low would be to share an apartment with a few others.\n\nIn your case, you can opt to do a joint rental with your wife, or have the rental be solely under a single name. No marriage certificate required if you choose the first option.\n\nYou should still bring the marriage certificate of course: it can be useful when proving spousal relationships at perhaps the hospital, in the event that one of you has to make medical decisions on behalf of the other."

Look to the west where TEL or Jurong Region MRT Line will be built or DT line where the final phase is almost complete. A BTO will take 4 years to be ready so that can be a guide.\n\nIf you prefer an estate that already has a sizeable young families demographic, NE areas such as Punggol or Sengkang and E areas like Tampines and Pasir Ris will be good. They are also near the airport if travelling is your thing(for work or for holidays)\n\nI would say transport is very fast in Singapore, takes 45 mins from Punggol to Harbourfront and about 1.5hrs from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon. During peak hours, it is recommended to have lines that have redundancy or transport nodes that have various buses to your work place in order to avoid the morning crowd."

The Eastern from jervois rd) and middle portion (everything in between) of RV is more assessable by bus rather than mrt. Also consider that RV is bounded by a river and the terrain has many small hills and slopes, so walking to fort canning mrt or even somerset mrt is more than just drawing lines on the map. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to say that Clarke quay mrt also serves this area, Remember that Clarke quay mrt is on the other side of the river at the central mall side, a big distance from RV proper. It may serve Clarke quay businesses but for residents as OP could potentially be, its quite far and doesn\u2019t make sense to use. Clarke quay is a bus ride down from RV though. "

This is near Telok Blangah MRT. Or you can take a bus from Harbourfront MRT.\n\nFor city sights you can visit Marina Bay to see the skyline or simply just spend it in Orchard Road for shopping.\n\nFor drinks and night life you can visit Clarke Quay.\n\nIt really depends on what you want to see and experience though.

I only speak English and have rarely had issues communicating in S'pore. \n\nDepending on what you and your family enjoy, these would be my recommendations of what to visit:\n\n* Gardens by the Bay\n* Sentosa Island (Universal Studios, awesome aquarium (expensive though))\n* Tiong Bahru - historic and hip neighbourhood, purposely not built up (all buildings capped at 3 storeys), best bakery, good cafes and cute shops (http://www.visitsingapore.com/walking-tour/culture/in-the-neighbourhood-tiong-bahru/)\n* Chinatown\n* Arab Quarter - pretty + can buy cheap pashminas here (expensive in NZ where I'm from)\n* Haji Lane - trendy and hip street, near to Arab Quarter\n* Night Safari\n* River Safari zoo - pandas!\n* Botanical Gardens\n* Singapore Museum\n* Peranakan Museum - showcases the history and culture of the Peranakan people. In a beautiful historic building and has a stunning collection of furniture, clothes, etc. (http://peranakanmuseum.org.sg/)\n* Eat at a hawker centre/visit Lau Pa Sat (http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/architecture/historical/lau-pa-sat/)\n* Singapore Art Museum (SAM) - always has great exhibitions and based in a beautiful colonial building\n* Gardens by the Bay - never seen anything like it before, also amazing greenhouses.\n* Marina Bay Sands - right next to Gardens by the Bay, there used to be a daily projected light show outside the mall/hotel. Worth seeing if it's still running.\n* For good views of the city - Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, ION on Orchard (free viewing deck)\n\nFor cheap meals, I would always try to eat at a hawker centre. Cafes, restaurants, and even food courts in malls can be expensive (or at least more expensive than hawker centres).\n\nThe MRT is very easy to use and everything is in English. I've always found taxis easy to come by and relatively cost-effective. \n\nHave a great time in Singapore!"

An explanation for why you\u2019re the one initiating meeting up can also be attributed to the fact that girls simply wait for guys to make that move most of the time. Her texting you to initiate a conversation is probably her trying to express her interest. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to know each other better to have a better idea of compatibility. Do you still like her; do you guys have fun together; do you guys enjoy good, deep conversations that are beyond the superficial level?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to rush into finding out if she\u2019s interested in you. My mantra has always been: Be friends, and when the moment feels right, ease into it and ask her in a non-pressurisjng way. "

There's an app version that you can buy but you can always just use the mobile website and it is the same thing. \n\nBut as others have said, you should factor in a wide buffer time because the bus system is very unpredictable and varies widely depending on traffic conditions. I've waited an hour at the stop for my bus before three of them arrive at the same time. But thankfully that is quite rare. \nAlso, during peak hours you may not be able to board the bus because it is filled to the brim, so you may end up having to wait for the next one 10 minutes later. And even that one might be full as well.\nGenerally I steer clear of buses whenever I can. \n\n\nThe train system is slightly more reliable because the trains arrive regularly every 3-5 minutes, but occasionally there may be delays because the train slows down or due to increasingly-common track faults. So don't expect to-the-minute accuracy like in Japan; a 10-15 minute buffer will be good. "

The smallest ive seen is 2 bedrooms. \n\na-5) I'm also okay with 30 - 60 minutes of commute.\na-6) What localities should I search for houses? And what are the average rents there?\n\nDepends on where your office is gonna be. \nIn Jurong East, Bukit Batok area.. common room - 400-700 is my guess. Master bedroom - 800-1000. \nFor an entire two bedroom unit, maybe 1.8-2.2k. \n\na-7) Do I need to pay an advance for the house before moving in? Like paying 12 months of rent in advance which will be returned to me when I leave that house (It's a common practice in India)\n\nUsually just one month deposit that's returned to you when you leave. 12 months? If anyone makes you pay that, they're cheating you. \n\na-8) Is there any other cost apart from rent? (like apartment maintenance fee, etc)\n\nIf you stay in a condominium, you might need to pay maintenance. Consider whether you'll really need a condo with swimming pool and gym and stuff. \n\nb) Transportation\nb-1) Cars are very expensive and I don't think I'll be able to afford them\nb-2) How much does it cost you to commute in bus/train per month?\n\nPublic transport is cheap. One way travel, max max max $3 per way. Assuming 2 way, 6/day * 30 days = 180 (Of course you don't work 30 days a month). \n\nc) Groceries and household items\nc-1) We are two persons and we mainly buy vegetables, fruits and rice.\nc-2) We try to be frugal as possible\nc-3) What would I be spending on the above items?\n\nUh, I spend about 200/month on the groceries mentioned above for 2.\n\nd) Mobile, Internet, TV etc\n\nd-1) I need to communicate with my family and friends in India, what is the best way to do this?\nFacetime? Skype? Whatsapp? I use all of these. \n\nd-2) Is calling over mobile networks cheaper over apps like skype? What about incoming calls over mobile networks? Just trying to get an idea here.\n\nIncoming calls are free for most postpaid plans. \n\nd-3) How much does Internet cost for usage like browsing, youtube, skype etc (No heavy downloads)\n\nUnlimited broadband access - I think it's between 45-65/month, depending on your speed and duration of contract etc. \n\nd-4) I don't watch TV but I think I'll buy one for my SO. How much do Indian channels package cost?\n\nHmm check Starhub cable tv's site. If I remember correctly from a few years ago, you need to get basic package + hindi/tamil/other channels, about 9/channel. Maybe a total of 40/month for cable tv. \n\ne) What is a reliable website to calculate tax?\n\nIRAS\n\nf) Did I miss any other important expenses?\n\nEating out? Come on, new place, you gotta try new food! :) (And yes, you can find loads of veg food here if that's your concern. )"

                "comment": "Hi,\n\nThanks a lot for the answers!\n\n> Of course rent depends on so many factors: proximity to MRT (train) stations, size of flat, area, how new it is, whether it's a condominium or a public housing flat.\n\nSorry for the miscommunication. I actually asked if rents differ significantly in different areas. For example rents in jurong east vs sentosa (random example)\n\n> Depends on where your office is gonna be. In Jurong East, Bukit Batok area.. common room - 400-700 is my guess. Master bedroom - 800-1000. For an entire two bedroom unit, maybe 1.8-2.2k.\n\nHow does the house sharing work out? Is it like multiple people sharing a house and they share the utilities/maintenance etc? Just wanted to confirm.\nAlso how does a condominium differ from public housing flats? \n\n> Eating out? Come on, new place, you gotta try new food! :) (And yes, you can find loads of veg food here if that's your concern. )\n\nYep, we do lots of eating out. But the prices at hawker centers looked affordable so I didn't ask. We'll also be going to parks and other areas.\n\nThanks again for your responses! :)\n\n"

I've seen 2 families sharing a 2 bedroom apartment. I've also seen the owner living in their apartment but renting out a master bedroom. \n\nSentosa? Uh Sentosa cove is like maybe 15000/month? Lol. There's no comparison. \n\nDefinitely prices are higher in central region. If a 45-60min commute is fine, choose something in the heartlands. \n\nWhere's your office gonna be? "
