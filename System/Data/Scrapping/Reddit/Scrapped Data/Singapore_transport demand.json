Here is an interesting factoid. Over the past 10 years, the number of undergraduates in NUS and NTU has risen  quite steadily. You would think that the number of faculty ought to rise in tandem right? Nope. The number of teaching faculty members have actually decreased! You can see this phenomenon across all the local universities. Its a blatant bloated bureaucratisation of the university at the expense of teaching quality. \n\nNUS undergraduate enrolment 2010: 24,785.  \nNUS undergraduate enrolment 2020: 29,510.  \nNUS faculty 2010: 2,609  \nNUS faculty 2020: 2,559  \nNUS \"executive & professional\" staff 2010: **2,084**  \nNUS \"executive & professional\" staff 2020: **3,741**\n\nWhat has increased?

You may remember other posts such as the [monkey stealing bread from the North Spine bakery](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/n7njyx/monkey_brazenly_stealing_bread_at_north_spine/), or the other [monkey stealing cup noodles at Crespion halls.](https://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/monkey-steals-cup-noodles-in-ntu-then-scales-railing-to-open-it?fbclid=IwAR2MCPku30-HVB5bZRbpg-F1AanRS-2gJhcgjejscNj7w_d0kwE_y39pvHY#xtor=CS1-10)\n\nThroughout last semester, there have been several occasions where these macaques have invaded students' rooms by sliding open the mosquito net and causing havoc inside, digging through plastic bags and ripping packets of food, defecating on the table, etc. (of course I'm complaining because I myself kena)\n\nJust talking to friends who stay in the NH halls area, it has basically become a \"norm\" seeing someone's room get raided or seeing monkeys camping the Cates food delivery drop-off point table.\n\nThere were several occasions where the monkeys would even appear at lift lobbies on upper floors of the halls to dig through the rubbish bins. The issue had escalated to the point where these monkeys were completely unafraid of people (would invade rooms even with people inside, would attempt to open bags at the NH playground even with adults and children there)\n\nUp til now, I still get updates that these monkeys have continued to wander common areas of NH halls.As for what have the school has done about it, they set up the \"long-tailed macaque committee\" to address this issue. Their first few actions were to change regular rubbish bins to monkey-proof bins (basically a bin with a latch that monkeys would not be able to easily open), and to set up signs in common areas that tell you not to provoke monkeys and to keep your windows closed at all times.\n\nThe tough part would be that with how tiny the NH rooms are, closing the outside-facing windows cut off so much air circulation that it makes staying in the room difficult if you didn't have air conditioning (even with the inside-facing privacy window open).\n\nI imagine that one of the fastest and most effective solutions would be to install locks on the mosquito netting panels so that they would not be easily slid open. (Due to the design, even something simple such as jamming the window tracks with a long removable object would theoretically work). Yet hall administration has yet to do anything significant about monkey room invasions apart from hosting dialogue sessions and \"monkey walks\".\n\nI believe Earthlink (environmental club) have been trying to address some of these issues to escalate to administration recently, but for now we have still been brushed off by administration to \"hide any plastic bags from view\" and \"keep all windows closed\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** monke messing with North Hill Residents, admin says suffocate in your rooms"

                "comment": "With regards to the NTU shuttle buses, I get the impression that the university management as a whole does not treat them with enough importance to run the services in a coherent manner. It appears that the management is happy to let students rely on the SBS Transit buses 179 and 199 plying through the campus, and the internal shuttle is mostly an afterthought.\n\nA key problem I have with the system is that **none** of the routes have a proper terminal to start and end. The closest you all have to a terminal is a haphazardly paved patch of land near the Graduate Halls where the buses park. This \"terminal\" is located not quite along the route but in between bus stops, so buses have to end at Saraca (Blue) or Hall 10 (Red) while starting from Opp Hall 10 (Blue) or the Grad Halls (Red).\n\nHowever, the route doesn't have a formalised start or end, so the bus drivers have to exit the \"carpark\", drive multiple rounds (up to three!) before terminating, to ensure that there is service across that gap. Anyone who understands bus bunching can tell you that having each trip be three rounds long will cause the buses to bunch up and the timings to be terribly irregular. The driver cannot guarantee that each of the three rounds will take the same time to complete! In contrast, at NUS where I'm based, the buses travel one round maximum and layover at a terminal that is along the route. So the departure times at the start of the route are always guaranteed to be regular - if a driver is fast and early, the break ensures he departs the terminal on time instead of too early, while if he is delayed along the way, he can speed up to reach, and subsequently depart, the terminal on time instead of late. Not to mention that if the drivers get more breaks, they'll have an easier life and hopefully drive safer.\n\nThe timings are also not coordinated, and appear to be based on when the drivers need to change shifts to drive for other contracts outside campus, so I've encountered the situation where I get \"kicked off\" the Blue at Saraca and the next three Blues are all terminating too. Would be far better if the Multi-round trips overlapped properly.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the management does not look at shuttle buses with the same seriousness as we do at NUS. I used to blame the choice of Tong Tar as an operator, as I generally don't have a good impression of them with their choice of off-brand Chinese buses (nothing against China but really? Step entrance Zhongtong Sunny?) and very cost-cutting 'chapalang' image, running with half the fleet being random coaches some of which bear advertisements for other shuttle services.\n\nBut I realised that RWS8, which is also contracted to Tong Tar, has a proper, exclusive, wheelchair-accessible fleet (also Zhongtong) bearing RWS advertisements and having working destination signage. In fact, the better buses in the current NTU shuttle bus fleet (Yutong) are hand-me-downs from the previous gen of RWS8! So with more investment, it's possible - Tong Tar evidently just doesn't see NTU as their most valued customer, I wonder why... (Meanwhile at Sentosa, ComfortDelGro Bus sends over buses that were used at NUS first...)\n\nI don't really know if all of this (the decision to invest more into internal shuttle) is within the control of Transport Admin or HAS or someone bigger, but I would encourage everyone to push ahead on these problems while being understanding of the constraints. I hope that one day when the constraints are overcome (like maybe there's an opportunity to construct or modify somewhere into a proper terminal) then a change will really be made to take advantage of that loss of constraint, and that change can only happen if students do think about these issues and voice them out. Don't give up guys!\n\n\\-The ISB Man of NUS"

                "comment": "> In 2019, NTU cancelled heartland shuttle buses under the guise of 'low ridership'\n\nDefinitely due to financial difficulty. The crappy on-campus shuttle service is also due to the unwillingness to pay a bit more to the contractors.\n\n> Lack of quality education\n\nThis is the issue of how NTU positions itself. Since university ranking does not look at teaching, it just gets ignored. Faculty members are also under the stress that the university tries to squeeze every bit of 'utility' out of them with an emphasis on research. In my view, this is unnecessary and not a sustainable way to retain the faculty members as it creates a vicious cycle: \n\npeople left -> higher cost to hire people (need to pay higher salary) -> more extraction from the new hires -> new hires left\n\nEdit: added the second part of the comment on education quality"

From the get go, it\u2019s very obvious which fac NTU prioritises. For students who take ureca, we are made to attend workshops that do not benefit our research areas at all (eg our projects are mostly interpretation with little to no data involved yet they force us to attend data cleaning, data sorting workshops in order to pass ureca). I\u2019m not sure if the administration even knows this or just assumes every student has to deal with data in their projects. Even in the template and guidelines they give us, it\u2019s obviously skewed to the sciences. Aim of study, methodology, results and impacts - these are not how a humanities paper is written. Even our profs (loveliest faculty members ever) are aware of this and are resigned to us having to skew our papers to fit ureca\u2019s requirement. Also, it\u2019s a known fact that it\u2019s much harder for humanities fac to get research grants/tenure, which is honestly a wasted opp because any one of us will tell you that our profs are really passionate and genuinely want the students to do well (which is why I was surprised when I heard about fac from other schools just plonking theory on their slides and reading off of it during lecture). Humanities profs are ones that really care about student wellbeing, they go out of their way to find us opportunities when they hear about our concerns, or if they know that a student needs help say, finding a job etc. I honestly find the lack of support for the humanities disappointing but I guess it\u2019s also the same in other countries where the arts and humanities are seen as non essential and disposable."

I took an EEE machine learning module, but all we got from the prof was a big bunch of messy slides of pure theory, and he would simply read through them during lecture. And the prof uploaded his slides (about 50-100 slides per chapter), in a format where we couldn\u2019t use Ctrl-F function (????). I have no idea why that restriction was there in the first place. I had to email in to request for the slides to be uploaded in a Ctrl-F-able format. The worst part was that the quizzes and final exam were based on memorising content. There was no coding involved in the entire module.\n\nI took an MS module that was based on pure memorisation as well. The worst part was that there were past year papers available in the printing shop. All we had to do was memorise the answer keys because there was a very obvious pattern of repeated questions throughout the years. I learnt nothing from this module. \n\nBack in NUS, all of my exams for my engineering modules at least included a one A4 sized cheatsheet. The exams consisted of application questions instead of definition questions.\n\nI spoke with other people that took these NTU modules with me, and all agreed that they sucked.\n\nApparently this is the norm for engineering students (memorising content for assessments)? Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nThis method of teaching feels very traditional and backward."

If the servers are fast and I fail to register my courses simply because I pressed too slowly or too early, that is my problem. However, when I have planned for numerous contingencies (I use multiple devices and multiple browsers for STARS), and I end up getting fucked over because of their shitty servers, it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. I was lucky that I usually end up being able to get the index I want anyway by doing quick changes with my friends or through add/drop, but I truly believe I am the exception, with most other students having to deviate from their carefully planned timetables due to the school's failings."

My uncle who also studied in NTU in the early 90s, was horrified when I told him my experiance, and lamented how NTU back in the 90s, was essentially a teaching university which was student-centric. \n\nDuring my time in NTU, there had been several complains about Lecturers with very poor command of English, who walks into every lecture, either disinterested or are bad in their command of language. The joke back than was how you are better of learning from Khan Academy and YouTube, than to actually attend lectures.\n\nI realised how true that was when in Year 2, I realised that all of my lecturers (esp those from India or China), were using TEMPLATE LECTURE SLIDES. These are basically slides that has been prepared by the publishers of the Textbook, which the lecturer than prescribes in their textbook list for the course. \n\nNow, I have had some awesome lecturers, who use these slides for visuals only. I have had lecturers who make their own slides, with some using self-written OHP slides.\n\nBut the majority of Engineering Lecturers, put in as little to no effort, by using these template slides provided by textbook publishers, and reading off the slides every time. \n\nMany of the issues that NTU is facing now, started appearing from Su Guaning's time, and continued on during Bertil Anderson. The whole notion of how NTU is a teaching university changed somewhere from 2005 onwards, with relentless prioritisation given to research and making teaching duties an add-on responsibility. Nothing wrong with that. But for a self-proclaiming World Class University, that aspires to attract Undergrads, they need to put much more effort to anchoring back NTU into a student-centric University."

It's well known as a \"tourist-attracting\" spot and has lots of tutorial rooms (big and small) for lessons. The Hive starts from level B5 to level 3, 8 floors in total, and has 3 lifts servicing the whole building. There's a few entrance points for the Hive but most common is the one at B4 and B5. However, I've come across various times where lessons are held on level 2 or level 3, which is at the very top, but when you enter the building from level B4 or B5 and attempt to take the lifts you instead end up taking the stairs. The lifts are ancient and move very slow. Whenever we attempt to take the lifts, they are either full or move very slowly, which is why it would be faster to just take the stairs. My friends and I have concluded that NTU only invested into the design of the building and not the lifts. Before anyone says strawberry or entitled, think \"Would you want to go climbing 6-8 flights of stairs for your lessons while carrying your bags and laptop, especially when most often your rushing to your next lesson in Hive from another building.\""

However, from what I recall, the only halal food available at South Spine is \n\n- Co-Op (western)\n- A Nasi Padang? Stall without halal certification\n- Stale vending machine sandwiches\n\n\nThere may be more i haven't eat at yet but as you can see, there's clearly a lack of halal stalls.\nThis also shows in the fact that us Muslims have to rely on Instagram pages such as https://instagram.com/ntu_halal_eateries?utm_medium=copy_link just to find halal food. \n\nThe article below summarises the problems we face and NTU clearly doing nothing about it (congruent to the issues you brought up to!) \nhttp://www.nanyangchronicle.ntu.edu.sg/news/2505halal.html\n\nBesides, non-muslims can equally enjoy halal food so it's not like only us Muslims will be buying from these stores. And, if there's more variety (instead of the same nasi Padang/or malay food),  then I'm sure the demand and sales would be better.\n\nI hope you can add this issue into your main post to let it be known how iNcLusIvE NTU is."

The management was terribly bad at handling and reacting fast in Mar/April last year that staff had to come to work everyday despite the govt informing of WFH arrangements. The solution to them was to segregate the office and separate each team but we were still seeing each other for meetings in the same building. It really depends how good each of the schools' leadership were and that their policies differs. Some staff were made to work alternate days but others were made to come everyday. The lack of quality and empathetic leaders, and the outdated mindset of staff who have been too long in the company and refuse to make catalytic changes, along with elite circle of Profs in their own clique, are some of the reasons why the administration has failed in some ways and it translates to an unpleasant experience for all."

                "comment": "Just found this thread. I agree with all of the mentioned points by OP.  and I wanna share my share of the story. \n\nMy background: An international student that had just graduated from SCBE.\n\nI went to an overseas internship in Jan 2020 in China. When the pandemic happened, my batch was asked (ordered) by the program officer to come back to Singapore else the internship will not be credited. I am an international student (the only international student in that batch of China internship program) and I do not have another home here in SG. A week before I came back (i.e., right after we are ordered), I wrote an email to HAS if I could have a hostel to stay in once I reached Singapore. No reply from HAS, and the program officer said she will check with HAS. I have sent few emails to HAS before the departure date from China. Till the departure day, I received no response from HAS. I was anxious as it was quite hard to even rent a room outside of NTU at that time. I came back on the 1st of February and the pandemic was not as serious as in March. Hence, I was not issued with a SHN. Even though I was not issued with a SHN, I went straight to the quarantine facilities in NTU (Graduate Hall 1, GH1) as I had no place to go. Within the two weeks stay in GH1, I emailed (no reply) and phone called HAS (The officer said she will see what she can do) numerous times. The 2 weeks stay came to an end and HAS had yet to get back to me. I asked the quarantine officer if I could stay a few more days in GH1 until HAS get back to me and the answer is no. I was left with no choice but to rent a place outside at a shady HDB (The owner did not register me at HDB and the unit itself is compartmentalized into 8 rooms) (I did not know that the owner had to register me at that time). However, I am still glad that someone agreed to rent me a place considered that I just came back from China. The best part was after I moved out from GH1, the quarantine facilities officer called me, saying that I have a bill for quarantining myself at GH1 (S$530++). The room at GH1 was great but the food supplied was terrible (sometimes with uncooked chicken). I did not complain during my stay in GH1 as I thought the stay was free. I raised this issue to NTU management and I just got a reply saying that he will look into this matter. :/\n\nThis was a very bad experience of mine with NTU (especially HAS).\n\nHowever, my school's management (and lecturers) are decent. The overseas program officer has no plan or suggestion at all on what's next for students like me but SCBE's course coordinator responded quickly and advised me on what I could do next. CAO also helped me a lot at securing a local internship. (If I am not mistaken, Ms. Ho was the person who handled my case, thanks Ms. Ho).\n\nOverall, I have close to zero issues with SCBE's lecturers as they are often helpful to the students. They take student's suggestions into considerations for their teachings and decisions. Most of them are very happy to offer extra hours to help students with their assignments and projects.\n\nOf course, there are still some mods that gave me bad experience (Unorganized notes and bad teaching, i.e., lecturer reading 1-to-1 whatever is written on notes w/o further explanation). My worst memory was a mod (Engineering Math) from a lecturer from SPMS. His accent is so bad that I gave up attending his class at all after the first lesson and studied entirely myself from the Internet. To be fair, I don't completely put the blame on the lecturer as he was trying his best too (but still...). These issues are still manageable for me (as I know where to search for the study materials) but I don't think my peers are happy with those lecturers.\n\nThese are the things that came to my mind for now. Will add on if I remember anything else.\n\nSorry for the bad English :X."

NTU does suffer in some aspects but much better than NUS in my overall experience.\n\nI had to switch schools because I was in engineering and I wanted to do psychology. I can tell you that ntu is a lot more caring towards its students than NUS. What makes me say that?\n\n1) Ntu Dean and head of department cares more than NUS. When I wanted to transfer course, I got rejected twice. Later I found out from my student advisor that it was for \"KPI reasons\". My only other option was to go to ntu. Not only that, I had to take leave of absence for health reasons. Not once in my nus course did I hear anything from the Dean or professors. In ntu they actually arranged a meeting with me to see how else they can support me and assist me in returning to my studies \n\n2) Ntu cares more for mental well-being than NUS (I can't say for physical because both wait times are abyssmal). I got an appointment much faster and they actually called to see which counsellor was best fit to my situation. Nus just sent me a last minute email expecting me to turn up in 1 hour.\n\n3) professors care more about you in ntu. In NUS, profs were often \"I didn't teach this segment you go find the dipstick who did\". Granted this wasn't their job but ntu profs were still willing to go through even though they taught different segments of the course. \n\n4) The admin staff were also more supportive overall. Email responses to staff (and profs) didn't take three working days.\n\n5) Internship ntu staff were also amazing. I got a no-allowance internship on my own and so there was no need to support me. But they found a scheme which allowed me to get some allowance in the end.\n\nOf course they aren't perfect. Before my transfer I had to submit some documents. But due to my leave of absences I didn't have (nor do I need) certain documents.\n\n1) the admin staff in charge of admissions kept asking me for said documents (6-7 times) and I kept responding if it's needed since I didn't have it. He said he would check before getting back to me. He didn't. And he asked for it AGAIN. \n\nGranted I know these are my experiences, but I just want to highlight that I personally find NTU felt much more amazing than my experiences in NUS."

Besides, with modules been graded according to the Bell curve, this complicates the whole guessing which mod you'll do badly in! \n\nThere was a mod I took which I was sure I wouldn't do well in because I just couldn't understand the concept, and I didn't get good grades for the project work - but surprisingly, that happened to be my best graded subject in that semester (I was shocked to get an A [my only A]). Now imagine if I had wasted my S/U on that?! \n\nFrom what I know, NUS get to S/U after finding out their grades. I know NTU wants to be special but please don't gamble our grades like this."

I remember one semester apparently one dept had a mass exodus of admin staff and the lower ranked people left behind were swamped with all the student enquiries while the higher ranked ones (usually also the same people who will be there for many years) are just behind the scenes doing idk what la. I remember distinctly because me and my friends were trying to secure a tutorial slot but there was only one guy handling everything, poor thing. And apparently it's still happening.\n\nBut our local unis bleeding academics is nothing new. There's always so much pressure from the institution to churn out publications and improve the uni's rankings and get the most cost/ranking/teaching benefits out from the acads they all leave. And the students just suffer because the upper management of the unis don't bother to look at the reasons why the acads are leaving."

You will not be charged school fees and your MOE Tuition Grant will not be affected. Then reapply during next year's cycle with your A Levels/Poly GPA.\n\nI've tried transferring from NTU to NUS (unsuccessfully) and from what the office told me the spaces are really limited. Your uni GPA has to be >4.50 to even get a chance of transferring.  Not sure if it's as competitive for SMU.\n\nThen again, you must have chosen NTU for a reason. You also have to justify why you dropped out of NTU - my advice, say you wanted to do a gap year to do internships. Your decision, just my 2 cents."

Maybe at least some things will be addressed.\n\nAlso, if you're already stuck with it, you can do your best to make the most of it, and I'm sure you can still come out strong and well-prepared for the world. As some other students have shared, there are good professors, so try to figure out who those are when choosing your classes. Knowing the problems with the system beforehand means you can be prepared and not be blindsided by them.\n\nIf eventually, you can become a voice for change, and one of a growing portion of the student body working together to make things better for yourselves, whether through your own initiatives, or by getting the administration to make changes, whether by negative or positive pressure, then that's also a good thing, and good practice for life.\n\nBut most important is your own education. Make sure you know what you want to have achieved by the time you graduate, and find the best ways to get there using what the school, and being in the school, makes available to you. Sometimes the most valuable things come not from the school itself, but from being with your fellow students or the other opportunities that become possible."

While I can't comment on the quality there, I know I had a good experience with the professors. \n\nI was from NBS, and while there are some middling professors, none were clearly bad, and there was a good amount of them who were *clearly* and overwhelmingly brilliant. I had a professor for business valuation that dissected abstract accounting and valuation concepts into bite-sized pieces and it was glorious.\n\nI know it sucks reading this right before matriculation.

I'm positive LTA can plan more buses that run from various parts of Singapore into NTU. It still serves the public because they can use the stations in between. Of course it means longer transit time than the direct shuttle bus but sitting on a bus ride throughout is convenient and a preferred option for some. We have more buses running to JB from various points around the island but pulau NTU? There's only 179/199 which you MUST take from boon lay."

For some of the core engineering modules, I can even use lecture notes and tutorials from year 2010.\n\nThe pedagogy is also extremely worthless. It encourages students to cram theories and spam tutorials to pass exams. Because most modules don't allow cheatsheet at all, we're forced to memorize formulas needlessly. \n\nThe practical component of the modules is either nonexistent or insignificant, so we end up producing engineering graduates who can't use oscilloscopes, write code or use solder. It's just a token inclusion into our curriculum so NTU can show that their curriculum is holistic.\n\nI've looked through the NUS curriculum and I still regret not choosing NUS instead. Even though EE may not be the forte of NUS, their modules are so modern and interesting.\n\nAnd don't get me started on how bad the social environment is. EEE is a dumping ground due to low entry requirement, and it's reflected in the students' attitude towards academics. For example, I've had a group mate who started to work on their part of class presentation at 7 am when the class was at 10 am, because she went drinking with her hall friends overnight.

Never stayed in halls so I have no idea what's wrong with it. \n\nAs for STARS, I never really had much issues with it during course registration. Then again, my cohort is relatively smaller so that may be the reason why the servers are able to cope. On the other hand, viewing exam results may take some time but I am usually not in the hurry to know my results haha."

Yeah the campus buses sometimes take a while to come but you can just take 179 or 199 and travel around campus with little to no issues since those buses come very frequently but with the additional public transport cost."

The S/U tool is meant to be used to allow people to take modules that they might be interested in, but not confident of doing well. Allowing them to take the module without fear of dropping their GPA. Also, it can be used for people looking to just put minimal effort into a module due to heavy core workload. You can also use it as a gambling tool, but that\u2019s up to us. \n\nThe S/U issue has been brought up many times by many students. But I\u2019m sorry to say that I feel that this issue really pales in comparison to the list of issues in the OP. And for that reason, I will not be adding this to the OP, or push for changes to the S/U system before the more urgent issues are solved."

I'm from SBS and everyone I have come across agrees with the low quality of education. I have also taken quite a few cores from LMS and the lecturers there were way better and nobody had complaints. I have many engineering friends and all of them have the same sentiment about the quality of education - it\u2019s not good.\n\nYes it's a small sample size, but if I had the means to make a survey and send it to all NTU undergraduates, I would do so.\n\n**EDIT: And it's really interesting how you claim that there are no complaints about the quality of education over at CS (amongst your peers) when your post -** [**HERE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/m7jzro/prospectivecurrent_scse_students_please_read/) **clearly states that a good proportion of former and current students are lambasting your school for outdated curriculum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How many percent of students agree that there was a lack of crowd management? I'm guessing it's just a small minority.\n\nI'm guessing you weren't on campus last year during semester 1? The whole of Singapore was on high alert and the streets/malls were virtually empty. But on campus, it was business as usual, with students being forced to attend online lectures at common areas, food establishments were as crowded as before COVID times and bus stops were overflowing with students."

And if the lecture has not done its job of adding enough value, why is there even a lecture at all.\n\nPersonally, I was lucky enough to be able to select most courses in all 3 local unis, but I also just want to get my degree over and done with.

Had a hard time understanding the prof's explanation. Consulted the prof on whether I can explain my own way and he told me why I couldnt follow his explanation. Then he got angry at me and said \"YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS IN JC! I AM NOT HERE TO SPOON FEED YOU\". The problem is that I was in Poly and when I told him I was from poly. He made this condescending remark on why poly students who arent even good enough for universities even bothered to apply for NTU and how I should just drop out instead.\n\nI lost all sense of motivation afterwards. I mean what is wrong with me trying to find a way for me to understand something by myself. Shouldnt be an educator be pleased to see one of his/her students taking initiative to find an alternate way of understand what is taught?"

Two bus stops between them and I'm supposed to teleport over in an instant. We literally spent the whole year being late for that second class and nothing was changed despite many complaints. This happened to quite a few other people in my year.\n\nAnd when it came to money they were so cheapskate on many student activities and always were finding new ways to charge us for stuff. The craziest thing is during my time there they made record profits, bought two additional (and unnecessary) campus buildings in Central London and then had the gall to try and fire more than a hundred research staff! The backlash was so huge they only ended up firing less than half of them but it was still messed up.\n\nI also think almost all uni online grade checking systems are crap. Have heard similar stories across multiple unis in the UK.\n\nIt's definitely not something to accept but from reading your post NTU doesn't sound all that worse than alot of unis."

It makes your whole argument bogus.\n\nI appreciate your activism and enthusiasm down here to voice out for student matters; I am also a current NTU student myself and some of the aforementioned issues you've described resonate with me on how NTU can improve itself better. But really, as I have seen your past activism and posts about how \"poor NTU provides for a proper education\" here before, posting on Reddit and complaining about them isn't going to bring any action to upper management other than spreading more awareness to the wider public (who I believe, are also not in a capacity to reform the school system as ex- or non-NTU students).

The wording they used in emails as in 'exception' made absolutely no sense, like they are implying it is not a right but a privilege that these students are not forcibly evicted within 14 days. Is housing not a basic need? How tone deaf can the administration be? Yes, I get that hostels, to a certain extent, are a privilege but this is more nuanced than that. It came with a promise and a responsibility for taking care of our students yet they fail to note that part.\n\nIt is even more ironic that they caused this big fiasco in the name of covid and fulfilling the 2-year guarantee for freshmen. Nothing wrong with using halls as a marketing tool, but something is definitely off when you're sacrificing your current students / breaking other promises just to keep their own promise to someone else. It's telling that NTU is more interested in raking in students than helping their own current students."

By bringing them to different part of the forest will not make wildlife encounter any less frequent. Bringing them to any other forest in Singapore will be just moving the problem from one area to another area (not to mention the local eco system relies alot on monkeys to spread seeds). These monkeys will have the similar amount of human encounters.And you got to consider that most monkey species (idk abt this specific species) have a territorial culture and they frequently eat and kill monkeys that encroach into their area. There is very little to no non cruel method to solve this problem. \n\nI feel for every other complaint though, NTU definitely fucked up most parts of their operations and student welfare. Just that this specific one is inevitable if you place a campus in the jungle. This issue plus it's remoteness was why I did not even consider NTU when picking a uni"

I really don't find it easy for LTA to unilaterally do anything to solve transport issues coming to/leaving campus; which is also the driving force towards hall space demand.

Are you joking? If you are indeed a current student you would know that the SU is a paper tiger and an extension of the administration. They have no real power or say in any issue. The administration uses the SU as their spokesperson and because of that the SU bears the brunt of student anger. \n\nIf the SU had any real power or influence in how the administration does things, you wouldn\u2019t see alumni that have graduated for over a decade saying that they have experienced the exact same problems that I have listed down (just read through the comments will ya?).\n\nAnd to reply to imntusenior\u2019s edit, I\u2019m also talking about IRL peers who don\u2019t use reddit.

Imagine if ur SMRT and SBS just came in irregular frequencies and lets you wait for up to 30 minutes (experienced multiple times personally) and having to wait for multiple buses to board, I don't think Singaporeans will accept that. Yoy may say that SMRT and SBS are companies and NTU is not, well, choose a better operator instead of Tong Tar or pressure them to do better.\n\nAs for modules, people cannot get their modules even if they followed the planned curriculum. Why? The servers  are worse than some cracked minecraft server ran in a kid's basement. Taking 30 minutes for a page to load? Imagine if Singpass did that! This problem has existed for so long, but management deems it unworthy of an investment not just for us, but the future batches as well :'(\n\nWhile I respext your opinions, I believe that NTU should do better, can do better and for some reason, just wouldn't do better. While NTU is an educational institution and you may say it lacks the resources, I would implore you to look at the decisions the management has made in terms of investments and decide if choosing reputation over students is the right thing to do!"

Some times students fail to see the bigger picture. Yes, some profs are shitty lecturers (NTU only cares about the research they churn out). Yes, NTU loves big fancy new projects that make the news. To what end, you ask? Well, all these contribute to arbitrary metrics that made NTU the best ranked young university. This means the degree you are getting will be held in higher regard all around the world.\n\nPassionate about shuttle bus, food and other issues affecting the student body? Run for the student union instead of give these places to foreign students who only want to pad their resumes. The student union is there to represent the student body and make sure the students are heard. But the student union is only as powerful/useful as the student body wants it to be."

Changing the duration of the quiz at the last minute, giving shitty slides with ramble-y and technical lecture videos and super vague grading criteria for projects etc. To make things worse, his quizzes are all in MCQ but done online, so there was a whole lot of cheating going on. i emailed the Dean about this but all i got was 'sorry for your experience, but it has already been marked fairly.'"

Even for companies, there are ones with good management. The management at the NUS looks way better. I do not know where exactly the differences are at the higher level.\n\nDoes NTU really charter buses from China to tour around Yunan gardens?  I think it's some tourist companies which are doing that, including NTU as one of the photo-taking sites in their Singapore tour. I know tourists who joined the week-long tour in Singapore and Malaysia were taken to NTU for photo taking."

Universities such as Harvard and Yale all have a huge amount of endowment funds, yet I haven't heard of anyone who studied or worked there claimed that the university's priorities were wrong. Again as a student or employee, I am inclined to interpret it as better management -- I was there for a year and it was truly different, even very different from the public universities. Is it just because their endowment funds are larger and thus they do not need to act niggardly and thus have better management? Is this also the reason that NUS has better services than NTU because it has a larger endowment fund? Misspending was a thing."

However, how many of us are willing to change our comfortable lifestyle that we have all grown accustom to?\n\nIt is the rich and powerful that holds the cards here in making a real difference. As humans we can be really selfish sometimes, as we can get too consumed by our own desires.\n\nIt is knowing all these facts that makes me feel sad for the future of humanity.

Anything other thing that is not air, water and food? Nobody will die without handphones and TVs but they are really nice to own.\n\nI think a better way is everyone asking themselves, is it OK if I don't buy it?

You guys not buying our stuff? Fine, I'll just move them to elsewhere to sell, same polluting manufacturing process, different place to turn it into money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>if we reduce the need to travel to work, we can also reduce the consumption of fuel, plus much more, such as a reduced use of air conditioning in offices, and a reduced wear and tear of tires.\n\nI'm not sure if WFH will really reduce energy usage overall, working at home using laptops with wifi still uses energy, nothing is stopping people from using air-con at home, sure energy usage in office will fall but wouldn't that make it a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>such as buying less clothes, going vegan, and not going for cruises,\n\ngoing vegan - so if we stop importing meat, does that mean we have to import way more vegetables to make up for the shortfall in nutrition that we formerly get from meat?  then what will happen to the demand for vegetables? Will we need to import way more vegetables to keep prices stable?  Will our food supply be less resilient if there are disruption because we counted out meat as our option? Also will cold storage be an issue? Frozen meat can last for months but not every vegetable can be frozen, chilled vegetables can only last for days before no one will find it appetizing. And how will the F&B adapt? Only veggie burgers available in fast food? How about restaurants? Hawker centers? How will they have to change their menu when they have to take out all the meat?\n\nnot going for cruises - 1 less option for people to have fun, cruise companies will exit Singapore since there is no money to be made here which means fewer companies to tax which brings me to the next point ...\n\nbuying less clothes (or things in general) - one consequence of buying less things is getting less taxes, whether is it from GST or businesses, how big of an impact will it be on Singapore's budget? I don't know but I certainly hope it doesn't affect the way we fund projects that mitigate effects of climate change in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, I know you are worried about the way we live as Singaporeans is affecting the climate and I agree the way we live isn't sustainable. But the truth is in a world where everything is connected, with the changes that we make, are we OK with the consequences that is not immediately apparent to us? Just like climate change affects all of us, these changes can also potentially affect as whole."

Unless there are proven health reasons not to eat meat, why should I?\n\nYou can downvote me all you want since I have karma points to play with. But you know besides the woke segment of the population most Singaporeans cannot be bothered too much about climate change. Personally, i think its too far removed from my current life for me to give 2 hoots about it. Sure, I would consider the environment before printing, or use my plastic bags to line my dustbins, or recycle wherever possible but nah not going any further. \n\nThere are other more meaningful and impactful causes to advocate for. Causes that make an immediate impact on people\u2019s livelihoods like racism, misogyny and homophobia. Thanks."

But what I can do is reduce my consumption of meat and gradually to move to \"energy efficient\" meat. For example, instead of having meat for my lunch and dinner everyday, I can slowly change to meat to one meal a day then slowly change to meat 3 times a week. At the mean time, I move from beef to pork and chicken, as they are less energy intensive to raise.\n\nLifestyle adjustments can be as simple as choosing to purchase more long lasting clothing brands than to support brands that engage in fast fashion (Like H&M and Zara), and try to make your clothes more long lasting like turning them inside out and put them inside a wash bag before washing them in the washing machine. Or avoiding taking using single use plastic like straws, utensils, plastic water bottle and plastic bag. \n\nSome nice to own items are bo bian, like laptops and hand phones because we use them beyond entertainment. We can do simple things, instead of upgrading your phone every year, make it every 2 to 3 years. Laptops, just make sure you do device maintenance every 6 months, like cleaning the fans, this can drastically increase your laptop's usability.\n\nTo be honest, I'm fine if the cruise industry is reduce or stop being supported given how much pollution they produced. Unlike smaller nations which depends on hoards of tourism from cruise, our main breadwinner, is still banking, services and high value manufacturing. We also don't earn much from them, especially their main source of profits is gambling and we already have two very profitable casinos here.\n\nWe can adapt to a certain extent, but the animals and the environment cannot. The IPCC has already stated this a Code Red event, that can threatened human survival, I don't know about you but if eating less appealing food and reducing consumption versus the potential collapse of human civilisation, I would pick the former. To me is either we do the lifestyle change ourselves or let the climate force us to do so."

I'll just address point 3.\n\n>Dover is not in a good state for preservation\n\nAfaik, you're a j2 student not specializing in environmental/biodiversity studies or anything. What makes you say this? Got source from a qualified professional?\n\nAs a matter of fact, I'll argue that it's in a good state for preservation based on its biodiversity numbers alone.\n\n- 120 species of plants and 158 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, snails, and insects \n\n- Around 45 per cent of the vegetation in the Dover forest has been classified as \"Good\" or \"Very Good\"\n\n- 16 locally threatened species of plants and 27 large trees of significance \n\n- Critically endangered Ficus virens, a mature tree that provides food all year round for a large variety of animals\n\n- Six locally 'critically endangered' or 'endangered' species \n\n>It's not even a forest, but merely an abandoned plantation\n\nYou are wrong that it's not a forest. Dover forest is grown on abandoned plantation land, and being grown on abandoned plantation land =/= it's an abandoned plantation. It's a secondary regrowth forest, specifically of the Adinandra belukar subtype. \n\n>It's not like you can integrate it into a nature corridor for animals which walk, at most it will be merely useful for migratory birds\n\nDover forest is surrounded by several significant wildlife habitats and forested areas like the rail corridor, clementi forest, btnr, and secondary forests in bukit batok and kent ridge. This connectivity is certainly exploited by animals other than migratory birds, like langurs. Also, 'merely useful for migratory birds' suggests you are unaware of how important migratory birds are. They are the ones that help control pests, pollinate your plants, and serve as food sources for other wildlife. \n\nSince we are on the topic of fragmentation. Urban heat island effect is certainly alleviated better when we have one large continuous chunk of forest compared to fragmented ones, much less scattered sapling trees along the roadsides."

You are basing your assumptions on the fact that everyone goes to the CBD to work, which is clearly not the case. As you said yourself- Jurong is a heavily industrialised area, and it will become even more populated with workers in the future when the port of SG gets moved there. And the comparison of Tuas to Punggol is not justified as well. Air pollution in Punggol is a result of our neighbours to the north, not our own factories. [There are no major manufacturing plants in Singapore, meaning that a vast amount of air pollution is caused by transboundary pollution.](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/industrial/2019/11/06/is-there-industrial-pollution-in-singapore-2/) This isn't a problem with Tuas because the region of Malaysia that borders the western side of Singapore is relatively rural compared to JB and Pasir Gudang.\n\n[Additionally, NEA constantly monitors the air around Jurong/Tuas and have found that ambieng air quality there is normal, and any weird smells are not harmful.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/parliament-smells-emitted-from-factories-in-jurong-industrial-area-not-harmful)\n\nI agree with you on the basis that Tanah Merah golf course is not a good place to build BTOs. But not for your basis of it being too far from the CBD. The 50000 workers at Changi Airport or the other few ten thousand people workers in the surrounding Loyang Industrial Region and Changi Biz Park would love to live in this area because it's so near. Rather, building BTOs at Tanah Merah Country Club is unviable because of one main reason. It's directly in the path of Changi Airport's runways and thus any BTO's constructed there must be super low. Additionally, the noise pollution caused will be unbearble just like you said."

Just because its a prime location for housing doesn't diminish its ecological value. I would like to also point out that a HDB environmental baseline study found that \"Dover Forest is home to at least 158 species of animals - including critically endangered ones - and 120 plant species\", thus making it a 'prime location' for conservation. Please consider its ecological value (along with its potential landuse/housing value) before committing to a decision to clear the forest.  \n\n\n2. I have asked my conscience, and it told me that a housing ballot is not the best way to promote social mobility. Targeted measures for lower income groups such as HDB grants and subsidies are a much better way. It is wishful thinking to assume that the lower income groups will magically be able to ballot successfully for these hypothetically highly popular housing flats, given the huge demand by non-lower income groups and even the more well to do demographics. Also, by extension of your logic, Toto/4D is a magic bullet for social mobility (ask your conscience if this is right).  \n\n\n3. Conservation of forests is non-mutually exclusive. Conserving Dover Forest will not necessarily cause Clementi Forest to be cleared (although I admit it may have some influence), or vice versa. We can both care about Dover Forest and Clementi Forest, as well as Tengah, or any other area of ecological and conservation value. If you keep plucking the lowest hanging fruit you will eventually have a fruitless tree.  \n\n\n4. I'm glad that you are trying to apply your understanding of physics and the principle of conservation of energy, but it is not as simple as that. Did you conduct a study on the travel patterns of the demography of Dover? Did you consider the proximity of their workplaces (and the potential Jurong CBD)? Did you conduct a quantitative study on how much in terms of energy costs you would save by building BTO in Dover as opposed to Tengah/Tuas, and whether this amount would be significant enough to offset the non-tangible value of ecological services and residents' perceived value of green spaces? Without these, you cannot definitively conclude that \"saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes\".  \n\n\nI propose a simple thought experiment: assuming the trains run on a constant schedule, how much energy/transport costs do you save if you board the train at Dover instead of Pioneer, given that your destination is Raffles Place?  \n\n\n5. I don't know enough about the property market to comment on whether or not the value of private homes in the area will be depressed over time. It is plausible, but then again I think it is idealistic to assume that developing HDBs in that area will build social cohesion and  dismantle the elite enclave.   \n\n\nI am glad that the students and youth are thinking critically about topics such as housing policy and environmental conservation, and I applaud your bravery to post such a controversial perspective."

Why don't we stop importing foreigners?**  \n>  \n>First of all, if I'm not wrong, purely foreign households cannot buy HDBs, so stopping the import of foreigners isn't going to make any difference in this case. Maids live with Singaporean households, and foreign workers live in dormitories. So they aren't exactly contributing to the spike in the domestic public housing demand, are they? **(Mic drop)**\n\nThis is absolutely incorrect. Foreigners do contribute to demand for public housing. Let me explain why.\n\nFirstly, not all foreign workers live in dormitories. We have roughly 1.7 million non-residents living in Singapore and only about 300k people living in dormitories. Obviously, most foreigners (workers, students and dependents) do NOT live in dormitories even if you take away the foreign domestic workers (around 230k). So, the remaining million or so non-residents living in Singapore have to live somewhere. Even if they cannot buy HDB units, they do contribute to the **demand** for it.\n\nSecondly, whole HDB flats can rented out to foreigners. In fact, HDB's [own statistics](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/renting-out-a-flat-bedroom/renting-out-your-flat/rental-statistics) do show that the number of whole HDB units rented out increased from 15,137 in 2009 to 48,195 in 2019, **more than tripling over the last decade**. The implications for this are that there are almost 50k Singapore households who no longer live in the public housing but hold onto their flat to earn rental income while living elsewhere. This means that there are 50k possible **spare** units that could have been released to the HDB resale market but the owners (who, may I remind you, are already living elsewhere) have not decided to sell them because they are subletted out, most likely to foreign workers or students. In effect, these HDB units are used as **investment properties** and the owners are acting as **landlords**.\n\nIf you restrict whole HDB units from being subletted or reduce the number of units leased out, you reduce the demand for HDB units for use as an investment property. The owners/landlords are likely to sell them away and increase the supply of HDB units on the resale market market, lowering their resale price and making them more affordable to resident buyers (citizens and PRs). One way to reduce the demand for HDB flats as investment properties is to do something about Singapore's non-resident population.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**2. It is a way to promote social mobility.**  \n>  \n>Many people do like the lottery effect, which such rare BTOs provides, for it is the only easy shot for such lower-income people to achieve social mobility.\n\nThis assumption that lower-income people go for BTOs in mature estates is... highly questionable. BTO units in mature estates are priced substantially higher than your average BTO in a non-mature estate, usually beyond the reach of \"lower-income people\"."

No matter how hard you try to justify the reasons that we need space for housing, it doesn\u2019t address the fact that these plots of land have been empty, unused for years. \n\nSure they are planned for housing. That\u2019s the keyword. It\u2019s only planned on paper and nothing more. One of them has even been reallocated from residence to become an expansion for an industrial park. This means that there are no solid plans for residential use at all. It\u2019s merely an earmark. (If you deal with HDB and other agencies you\u2019ll find this is a common practice - announce first, plan in detail later, in this case even a decade later nothing is planned) So the question now is: if you tear down a forest while there\u2019s still available land, which do you use first? The vacant land while your forest is destroyed? Or use the forested land while other land remains vacant? Either way you spin it, it will all come back to saying that there is _no urgent need_ for the land to be repurposed for residences. That has been the core reason of this debate. If we really need housing spaces that badly, sure take the forest down. But if you take time to understand how the government agencies work and pay attention to the deeper details, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s not the case. \n\n\u201cWe need them for emergencies like covid temporary dorms\u201d\n\nYes and no. We can see from the covid response already, not a single one of the plots of land in the vicinity were used. Instead they look towards large exhibition areas, vacated HDB blocks that haven\u2019t been torn down yet, etc because it\u2019s cheaper to repurpose them. And if this argument is true, we should just open up a new category \u201cemergency use\u201d instead of allocating it for residences. Because we have to be prepare for emergency all the time right? This spare land might as well be permanently left empty. Just like how you can leave a forested land permanently under nature reserve and leave it the f alone."

We could continue to have more in-depth discussions if you are willing to.\n\n>**It is a way to promote social mobility.**\n\nThis is a rather huge claim. Social mobility is really a huge issue. Having a bunch of new houses from establishing new residential estates will influence that is really questionable.\n\nAnd simply owning a good value house doesn't necessarily mean one can move up the social strata. There are so many unpredictable factors at play to lead to that eventual conclusion that without any substantiation, one would not be readily convinced.\n\n>**Saving this forest destroys other forests**\n\nOne forest is not necessarily mutual exclusive to another.\n\nDevelopmental plans are specific to site conditions, such as topography, soil types and stability, nearby infrastructure, height restrictions, GPR etc. All of these might not be the same at another site and hence a certain kind of development might not be suitable elsewhere. This claim might be true for some, but to generalize it for all forests is again, a very huge claim.\n\nBoth this and other forests could be destroyed, or both could be preserved, the fate of one isn't always dependent on the fate of another.\n\n>**Saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes.**\n\nFirstly, not all people work in CBD. Secondly, the trains and buses will run regardless of whether some people from an estate use them or not. Lastly, how significant is having a new estate on the general commuting patterns islandwide?\n\nLooking at the above,  I would say maybe your claim is valid, but most probably not significant   at all to be considered a benefit.\n\n>**Preserving this forest benefits the wealthy; destroying it reduces class segregation.**\n\nAgain, this sounds like a really huge claim. I don't deny that this could be a rich problem, an opposite of the NIMBY problem, but you are creating a false 'us vs them' argument here.\n\nIs it really only the wealthy benefitting? There are also not so wealthy people living near. To what extent can one curb class segregation simply with establishing a new estate?\n\n>**Environmental and heritage conservation, they are often in conflict with each other.**\n\nThat's a false dichotomy. Environmental and heritage conservation can always come hand in hand. It is highly context dependent, on what kind of environment impacts and what kind of heritage.\n\nFor example, Botanical Gardens. One could argue that heritage is preserved through the preservation of certain trees and historical elements, while the environment is also conserved because well, it became a park.\n\n>By destroying a part of the forest, you maximize the number of Singaporeans who can enjoy the lowered temperatures that the forest's remaining sections provide.\n\nI'm afraid that's not how Urban Heat Island works.\n\nWith reduced forest size, the capacity to absorb heat by the forest is greatly reduced. And also now on the original forested land, you have concrete which traps way more heat than any other natural material. So would the forest's remaining sections really still provide lower temperatures to the surrounding? I highly doubt so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs someone studying and working on urban planning, it's nice to see people like you trying to understand things a little deeper.

I would come to a compromise where only the plot of land nearest to the MRT station be developed into HDBs BTO flats that can be built as tall as possible in order to maximise the utility of the land while the remaining parts of the forests are developed into nature parks for the residents and students in nearby schools to enjoy and learn. Also, a million net gain of trees should be planted."

Dover is objectively a shitty forest (low diversity, dominated by exotic rubber trees, don't like the statistics about number of species fool you, it could very well be all exotics) compared to Bukit Timah or even buffer parks like Thompson or Chestnut which show some forest succession in certain areas. Most of Singapore's south is on depleted clayey soil which will not mature into good, biodiverse secondary forest due to the history of intensive rubber cultivation in the area. Case in point: the belukar forest in NUS campus and Kent Ridge, Dover forest can't ever achieve the biodiversity the Central Catchment or BTNR can barring massive human intervention (and even then, our knowledge of tropical forest succession still has holes and it's a 50 year process)\n\n\nDover is entirely dominated by rubber (an exotic) and birds are a poor indicator of ecosystem health as they can fly wherever they please based on what conditons suit them. Reptiles and amphibians have very limited mobility and their presence/absence is a more accurate indicator of ecosystem health. And Dover Forest's herp diversity is very poor.

If so, here comes the question:\n\nIf you look at the URA masterplan, large portions of  forested areas adjacent or nearby to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is drawn as residential land or reserved for development. The area being explicitly marked for development dwarfs Dover forest\u2019s size, yet I don\u2019t see anyone getting as agitated in wanting those areas to be preserved.\n\nAnd by preserving Dover, we increase the pressure to demolish and develop those plots.

I take the issue of climate change from the perspective of physics rather than biology, as a generic equation of balancing our carbon footprint, so it is true that I\u2019m not the most well-informed person about this issue. Just a few comments.\n\nFirstly, from a cursory observation of the forest, I can tell that it is split in 2, by a covered human walkway for the rich people up north. The forest is already fragmented, and the eastern portion is really tiny. I\u2019m not sure how capable is it in sustaining a decent animal population. If it is not able the sustain it, then there isn\u2019t much fauna worth preserving, and Dover forest should be destroyed. If it is able to sustain it, then the animals living in the east side should be capable of making do with what remains in the western section.\n\nSecondly, what you mention of animals other than migratory birds making use of the forest connectivity, that concerns me. From what I know, there aren\u2019t any eco links that bridges the forests together like the one along BKE. And I don\u2019t think animals are smart enough to make use of overhead bridges. I may be wrong, monkeys can be pretty smart. But if those animals do make use of the connectivity, wouldn\u2019t there be a lot of roadkills between the forests by now?\n\nAnd now, last point on urban heat island effect. That would be an argument for saving bigger forests like Tengah, Simpang, or even Clementi over Dover, since bigger = better. Dover doesn\u2019t really have a lot of depth to it. Of course, that\u2019s based on an assumption on my part which I would like to challenge: what is the minimum forest size where the urban heat island effect is considerably alleviated?"

I used to work at Tuas before, a company that handles shipping (gee, what a surprise right?). It was awful. I fucking hated my time there. It didn't even feel like Singapore. It actually made me feel like money was worthless there because there was just so little shops, places around to spend money. \n\nTo give more perspective, the vending machine was literally my BEST FRIEND because it was always there for me, until the guy doesn't refill it. \n\nMore urban development would have to be started there before people can actually 'live'.\n\nTL;DR Tuas fucking sucks. OP say 'touch your heart' and my heart says fuck tuas."

Do you know what kind of animals are in there? I\u2019ve been searching high and low on Google, and I can\u2019t find any details about that.\n\n2. Not wrong, there are better ways for social mobility. BTO is just one of them. Though we have less of this, we better remember to have more of something else. Otherwise social mobility might tank.\n\n3. True. I\u2019m just not very confident that public opinion will push for both forests preservation. If Dover is preserved to much fanfare while Clementi is destroyed as nobody is looking, that would be insult to injury.\n\n4. The truth is, I don\u2019t have an answer to that. But I can speak in terms of probability. The probability that a workplace (even if it is not a CBD) is nearer to a person is pretty high in Dover than in Tengah, in terms of travelling time. Perhaps Tuas will be closer to Tengah than Dover. But one-north, Ubi, Jurong East, and Tampines will be closer to Dover than Tengah. Perhaps not by a lot, but by some. You will need more fuel to get to those places by car. Of course it\u2019s worth noting that if you work in Pasir Ris it\u2019s unlikely that you choose to live in Dover. But those kind of commutes do exist, and one can look at the LTA Datamall API for such details.\n\n5. You can try looking at a few places about URA prices, as I did last time when I was discussing the issue with some Redditors. They think that the prices will increase as you are now nearer to amenities. But well, it does actually either stagnate or decrease. I don\u2019t think building poor people houses next to rich people houses will be the silver bullet which dismantle the elite enclave. But it helps to a certain degree. If it doesn\u2019t, the Ethnic Integration Policy will be dismantled for HDBs by now \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be useless to promote social cohesion amongst races?"

                "comment": "Hi. Some of the arguments are much stronger than the other. Especially the one on transport. Let me address your concerns.\n\n1) I will define prime location to be a location which holds a certain level of convenience and prestige that most Singaporeans do not get to reside in. Generally, that means that while there may be other prime locations that aren\u2019t near MRT stations, those which are near MRT stations and aren\u2019t on the far ends of Singapore are prime locations. Dover is a prime location. You have exclusive landed properties up north affording a certain level of prestige, and easy connectivity to the city down south.\n\n2) BTO as social mobility is indeed a joke. But as flawed as it is, it is still a mode of social mobility. If we have less of this, we must not forget to have more of something else. Lower-income people stand to have a chance to benefit from it. By the way, in this case I define lower-income people very broadly, it is people who cannot afford landed properties. This includes middle-income households living in 5-room HDBs or small condominium apartments. Maybe I should have cleared the miscommunication out. Those people would be relatively poor compared to those owning freehold landed properties.\n\n3) Clearing Dover forest provides zero guarantees but it provides more reasons to support whatever that is left. If we try to conserve everything, we will end up conserving nothing. The government will just proceed to chop the remaining trees and ignore the pleas because there\u2019s no sense of which to prioritise and which to not.\n\n4) Even if we assume that people work elsewhere, like one-north, Ubi, Paya Lebar, or Jurong East, the effect of the commutes average out such that an average commute from Dover is shorter than that in say Tengah. Of course, people tend to live closer to where they work. But that\u2019s not always the case. There are people whose workplace is in the wrong end of Singapore, in relation to their place of residence. And for those kind of people, living closer to the CBD or Circle Line is beneficial to them.\n\n5) It is all the more a reason to support the destruction of Dover forest because the rich benefits more from its preservation. And society stands to benefit from less class segregation if a more diverse class of people live there.\n\nNow to the second part.\n\n1) In that case then I\u2019m sorry that many Singaporeans with a foreigner/PR parent like me are to be blamed for being not true-blue enough.\n\n2) The argument still applies even if not everyone works in the CBD. See above.\n\n3) I guess you have a point? But still, we know that it will eventually happen.\n\n4) If you consider them to be exceptions, then man there are plenty of exceptions to make. Commonwealth. West Coast. Circuit Road. Tiong Bahru. Clementi. Toa Payoh. Boon Keng. Each has its own story, and hold memories to many. En-bloc destroys entire communities and causes a cultural genocide, especially when it comes to HDBs.\n\n5) To determine whether this argument is bizarre or not I will need to ask you the minimum forest size where there is still a significant urban heat island effect on the surroundings. If it is larger than Dover forest, then that\u2019s not a reason to preserve Dover forest. If it is smaller than Dover forest, it is justification to axe certain parts of the forest to maximise the amount of people who can benefit from such an effect."

As the OP said, would anyone want to live in ulu areas occupied by the golf courses? And are golf courses totally useless? Who knows if there are rich billionaires (whom Singapore have been trying to attract) that happen to be massive golf fans?\n3.\tIf Dover is preserved, the immediate land issue is not resolved and the HDB will simply find another plot away from the limelight to demolish. And this time, that plot will be further away from MRT and might possibly be in a height restricted zone, forcing HDB to demolish a larger forested area to house the same amount of people. Is that a better option for nature?\n\nIn the long run, yes, we should cut down less and try to repurpose land with high utility value for housing, such as *cutting down the huge area covered by landed properties*! But in the short term, it is inevitable to cut down forests and the focus should be to minimise its impact.

After all, it\u2019s just difficult to focus on many plots at once. While the spotlight is on Dover which hasn\u2019t even started deforestation, we have deforestation on Tengah, Gali Batu, Kranji, Lentor, Yishun, Punggol, Tampines North, Bedok South, Lim Chu Kang, et cetera. Indeed those places have been irrevocably changed and will never turn into what it used to be again. But there\u2019s still places which shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted, like Simpang. And we know that many of those parcels of land falls near an airbase, and will not be utilised to the same degree as if Dover is used instead, given lower gross plot ratios.\n\nThat\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from when I say, \u201csaving a forest destroys another forest\u201d. Not that it\u2019s mutually exclusive, but that the public has a really small attention span, and concentrating too much or tunnel-visioning on one forest when there are other bigger, more ecologically and environmentally useful ones out there being neglected and secretly demolished, won\u2019t help to combat climate change in the most optimal manner. All that is would be virtue signalling, and that\u2019s all. If we have to build in a forest, it will be better to demolish a forest and build 3 times higher, than to demolish a forest 3 times the size to accommodate the same number of households."

                "comment": "While the biodiversity may not be unique to Dover, the very definition of a (critically) endangered species is one that is 'considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.' Surely that means we should try to conserve each and every single individual of that species? These species are already at risk of extinction - which is all the more reason why we should ensure its diversification in locations, by maintaining its numbers/presence in dover. We don't want a situation where we have all of our endangered species concentrated in one or two locations, like the nature reserves. Not only does it severely limit the gene pool and promote inbreeding, once a disease strikes, that's it for the species. So yes, I daresay that the loss of Dover may *potentially* result in the loss of the endangered species.\n\nYou might say to just relocate the endangered wildlife to other forested areas. Well yes, but how sure are you that the animals will be able to adapt, reproduce, and thrive successfully in their new habitat? And again, this links back to my point abt diversification of gene pool by having the species be spread across various territories.\n\n>The area being explicitly marked for development dwarfs Dover forest\u2019s size, yet I don\u2019t see anyone getting as agitated in wanting those areas to be preserved.\n\nSimple reason, there wasn't the media hype, wasn't reported in mainstream media outlets. I believe the Dover forest issue blew up only after mothership did an article on the petition, correct me if I'm wrong. Admittedly aside from people jumping on the bandwagon, there are also people who care just enough about conservation to defend Dover forest, but not enough to find out abt other issues that's not reported as widely. I can say in all honesty that I'm the latter, so I wasn't aware of this before you pointed it out. Still, it's a step forward in awareness.\n\n>And by preserving Dover, we increase the pressure to demolish and develop those plots. Is it really a better option?\n\nWho knows? Nobody can say for sure. But if all the attention is already on Dover (and not on these other plots of forest), and noise is what you need to get the govt listening, then I can see why environmentalists are fighting for its conservation."

It also serves as a stopover point for migratory birds on the East-Asian Australasian Flyway, according to the NSS, meaning it's important for allowing raptors like sparrowhawks as well as smaller passerine birds a place to recover after a fairly arduous journey.\n\nThe flora found there isn't too commin either. Working off an NUS paper I found, it seems there are ~20 species nationally endangered found there, and even one presumed extinct (the magenta cherry tree). Certainly much more ecologically valuable than your rather dismissive claim that it's an abandoned plantation would suggest."

In fact even though I used to live at clementi avenue 1, exactly in between clementi n dover mrt, i would take it over living at dover mrt whr there are NO amenities. \n\nSP is a school zone, don't think anyone will build a mall there bc it will distract students. Hence it is a bad idea to use it for housing only. I urge you to look at it from a supply demand perspective. I worked in the cbd since i graduated. Just bc dover is nearer than jurong west doesn't mean it makes a big difference to my fellow commuters. Many of them choose to stay in queenstown, cck, bedok etc. Choosing a BTO has a lot of factors like proximity from their parents, amenities, etc. \n\nBtw, not sure why you think it's a personal attack on you by saying u r from SST.

                "comment": "> public is paying too much attention on one tiny plot of forest, to the point that everywhere else appears neglected and not rigorously discussed, on whether they have the same, less, or more value when it comes to preservation. \n\nWell yes I do agree with that. In fact, as some other commenters have mentioned, this is , at least to a certain degree, the result of the bandwagon effect. \n\nThe disproportionate amount of attention on this specific plot, which undeniably has relatively less value compared to other forests, made this whole 'conservation' thing very questionable. Not that there are no environmentalists out there truly concerned, but how many amongst all those who commented truly care about nature? \n\nThen again, it's not necessarily a bad thing. More attention on one can bring people's attention to the wider topic and other areas (hopefully), and spark debates and discussions, which is evident here in this thread of yours. \n\n>  That\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from when I say, \u201csaving a forest destroys another forest\u201d. Not that it\u2019s mutually exclusive, but that the public has a really small attention span, and concentrating too much or tunnel-visioning on one forest when there are other bigger, more ecologically and environmentally useful ones out there being neglected and secretly demolished, won\u2019t help to combat climate change in the most optimal manner \n\nI see. Indeed. With land scarcity around, choices are really limited. The balance between development and conservation is very intricate, and people are spending their whole lives dedicated to it. Maybe it's possible to have no forests cleared in Singapore from now on, but the costs, the impacts, the price of alternative solutions, are we capable of handling them? \n\nUrban planning, which could also include the public transport planning which you are interested in, is really complex. More often than not, it's about trade-offs, sacrifices, compromises. Everything comes at a cost. Ultimately, the discussion should not be simply about how bad one decision is, but rather, what are the pros and cons of this decision versus another, what is the value of this land use versus another. Truth is, nothing is truly equal in this world, somethings naturally have higher value than another. \n\nYes there is irreplaceable value in a secondary forest, but how does it compare with a primary forest?  Yes the land can be left as it is and develop somewhere else, but how does it compare with developing here instead? \n\n**Always plucking the lowest hanging fruit will inevitably result in having no fruit at all in the future, but not plucking ANY fruit right now and you wouldn't even survive to see tomorrow.**"

The smaller birds listed were listed as being seen flying over the site. As for reptiles and amphibians, green crested lizards won't magically go extinct if Dover forest is destroyed. Asian softshell turtles may even be someone's unwanted pet. If destroying Dover forest means less encroachment on nature reserves, it is a sacrifice we have to take. The ideal scenario of course is no more encroachment anywhere from now on and instead a focus on forest succession (Dover, being part of the nutirent poor Southern Ridges and an abandoned rubber plantation, can never succeed into a mature secondary forest like in the CCNR and will instead become Adinandra belukar forest like in Kent Ridge) and connectivity (even so, Dover's position barely connects it to anywhere given the relatively poor biodiversity of the Southern Ridges) but let's be real URA would never let that happen."

Is building *tall buildings* right under the airplanes flight path a good idea?\n\nPerhaps the Tanah Merah golf course is the most ideal utilisation of land given its location!\n\nAnd none of your point answers my argument about the immediate need for land. Forest can be cleared quickly. The same could not be done for land already utilised. It is only fair that the government give advance notices and enough period of time to wind down. \n\nThe leases to many golf courses aren\u2019t renewed and those are already in the plan to be redeveloped. In that case, we are simply taking future land to use it *now*, and then run into the same problem later and increasing pressure to clear other forested lands.\n\nAnd to whoever is misusing their downvote button, this post already is prefaced by the two words \u201c**unpopular opinion**\u201d.

There are some basis, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be quoting sources here and there in the main passage. Anyways, with regards to my opinion on transportation, my stand is derived from what I observed in a few datasets from the LTA Datamall API a couple of years back. People who live further away from the city commute further, on average. Did some basic calculations with the carbon footprint of an average public bus, train or private cars and how many big trees there are in Dover with Google Maps. The data is probably fairly inaccurate, but the numbers doesn\u2019t look very good for me. I don\u2019t have the resources myself, but it is what it is.\n\nAnyways, it is easy to disprove a point. It can be difficult to prove a point to the point where there is no way to rebut at all. That I agree. Otherwise, we won\u2019t have people who have to spend their lives in fields like geography and urban environment. That\u2019s why when I see opinions of biologists and urban planners in here, I take their opinions much more seriously. Because they know a lot more things that I don\u2019t.\n\nAlso, the last paragraph is a terrible misrepresentation of what this unpopular opinion is for. It is a straw man argument. There is no way for me to argue logically with that. So I won\u2019t.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve also looked up on the use of the phrase, \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d, in case I used it wrongly.\n\n> Constructive criticism is the process of offering **valid and well-reasoned opinions** about the work of others, usually involving both positive and negative comments, in a **friendly manner rather than an oppositional one.**\n\nUnlike some other redditors who have offered me grand insights on the diversity of species in the forest, you haven\u2019t really managed to offer anything but comments of a cynic (in the few threads that you have made on this post), so\u2026 uh, I won\u2019t be able to reply to you and you specifically from here on."

There is a supposed backlog of applications for BTOs. Why would Dover magically solve this? It hinges on the idea that some people will get it and thereby become enriched because they can sell for a lot after MOP is done.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t social mobility. It\u2019s literally a lottery. You have no way to ensure that the BTOs will go to those that actually need it. Also, those really poor? They actually can\u2019t afford BTOs. So you\u2019re still ignoring that subset. What you\u2019re actually trying to promote is a lottery for the middle class. \n\nHave you even been to the area? If you see the responses about the large plot of land in Ghim Moh, I know exactly where that is. Why would you want another large forest to be torn down and become a literal field? \n\nAnd this idea of everyone wanting to live centrally is also flawed because not everyone works in the city centre. I know a doctor couple that loves living in Upper Bukit Timah (so not the expensive part) because their clinic they work at is in the west. That also applies to other people who work in the West. The same thinking would also apply to those that work in the East or any other part of Singapore that is outside of the city centre to be honest. But it\u2019s easy to forget that because most younger ones seem to want to work in the city centre, which I suppose makes sense, but ignores reality."

And by looking at some of the more questionable decisions (reserved presidential election, POFMA), people's concerns are founded.\n\nIn a country where we embrace diversity (culturally and workplace) perhaps our political scene could do so as well."

Similarly, for every mistake, I am mindful whether it's the minister fault or the gaps of the civil service.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, the parliament (directly elected by the people) sets the bills and laws. If having such achievements (credit is to politicians and civil service, not just the politicians)  mean that they can sweep questionable decisions e.g. elected presidency, POFMA under the carpet, having a strong mandate only sends the signal that more of actions can be condoned. Hence the blank cheque argument."

A lot of the things that you have listed are, for lack of a better way to put it, items that would have had to be done, regardless of which party is in power. \n\nHowever, if you consider the gripes that people have, a bunch of these come down to fundamental ideologies, such as freedom of speech, protecting the Constitution or equality to all. These are much more difficult issues to address but they do impact how we move forward as a society in the future. Do we allow people to speak freely or have fear that they will be hit with governmental interference such as POFMA, do we really want our Constitution to be amended easily (because that is how it is right now) and do we want to allow people who are \u201cdifferent\u201d to feel as if they are not prejudiced against. \n\nIt\u2019s not as if the Govt can ignore the bread and butter issues like the economy and jobs because that would constitute a complete and utter failure on their part. If they didn\u2019t even handle that, they would be in trouble. But just handling those issues alone constitutes a passing grade in my book, not a good or great grade."

They do not take into account the other factors and hence seem like a very simplistic overview. It may sound good listing them out, but you need comparisons. \n\nWhy did they build this, was it built before the need arose or is it just fighting fires constantly?\n\nHere are some things to think about.\n\nPioneer generation package, 9 billion. How much has been disbursed? \n\nSame with merdeka generation package. What is the comparison?\n\nChas card for chronic illnesses. How much do you think someone gets from this? For a chronic illness, you would spend somewhere between $600 to $3000 a year on drugs, consultation, treatment, etc As a diabetic, i looked into this, i can get $28 for the whole year.\n\nHospitals & polyclinics are still overcrowded, tried to get an appointment at a polyclinic lately? Or a hospital bed? The fastest wait for my aged parents was 12hrs, this was in feb this year. How long have we had a shortage of hospital beds? Since before the last election.\n\n$8 heart surgery... i needed an mri scan, used my medisave. You can only use $300 for a scan that costs $1300. Specialist at sgh, $400, cannot use medisave. The battery of blood & urine tests, cannot use medisave. Getting results of those tests, $100. Cannot use medisave. \n\nPaying to get your test results....think about that. I get an annual check up at my gp, all in $200 plus. \n\nGST, many countries with gst do not tax basic goods like rice, flour, bread, sugar, oil. We tax everything. And its not a flat 7% tax. By the time you buy something, how much tax has been paid?\nDistributor brings in product x for $100. Gst $7.\nDealer buys it for $150. Gst $10.50\nConsumer buys it for $200. Gst $14.\n\nEducation - we spend millions on foreign students. But we don't have enough for our own students? We have things like the pocket money fund, raised from our citizens, but the govt pay for foreigners? We don't have enough places in local universities for singaporeans, so instead of making more available, we bring in FTs to plug the gaps? That does not make sense. Could the courses not be enlarged? Could more courses be offered? \n\nTransport - the govt studied HK's MTR system before building our own mrt. \n\nThe mrt was built to handle a population of around 3 million. It was also built without any plans to cater for our current population. \n\nHK runs 8 carriages per train, 5 doors per carriage. 40 doors\nWe have 6 carriages per train, 4 doors per carriage. 24 doors.\n\nWhich will move more people? Can we add carriages to the trains now? Lengthen the platforms?\n\nBangkok also built a similar system, which is currently underutilised, they planned for 8 carriages & 5 doors. But currently only running at half capacity with 4 carriages.\n\nWho planned better?\n\nLRT - more firefighting. Poorly designed, poor quality, plagued with problems.\n\nAll that aside, no maintenance. \n\nAll the points above, where was the planning? \n\nSure, its not easy, but the govt is the highest paid in the world, as many have said. Does real madrid aim to be in the top 5? Man U? \n\nI was a pap supporter, i believed in them. But they're just  trying to live off their glory days now. \n\nName 1 issue in the last 10 years that they solved, and did so well, that made you go \"wow\". \n\nNow can you think of any issue in the last 5 years that was badly managed?\n\n Too many things have gone bad, the pettiness, the fixing of opponents instead or problems, the \"i can, you cannot\", i can bring up the past, but you cannot. The not admitting fault... does it remind you of any teenage relationship that you had?"

Its not about PAP or WP or SDP, its whether Tom or Jimmy is more capable in helping me. \n\nBut the reality in Singapore is far from that, and sadly the GRC system in SG is not any help in this either. And when it comes to national issues, only twice in the history of PAP did PAP members vote against party lines, so when you're voting for PAP candidates you're voting for PAP stance on national issues too. And if you're voting for PAP you're also voting for a polarisation of stance on national issues.\n\nVoting shouldn't be this complicated, i agree. But because of the super-majority PAP does enjoy in the Parliament, it makes this issue so much more trickier than its supposed to be. If the SG Parliament is more balanced between both parties ,then voting for the better guy in this situation would be the easiest thing to do. \n\nSo there will be people voting opposition solely because \"anything but PAP\". Which is a shitty stance to take, but not a completely stupid one after-all. Because due to SG's small size and homogenous culture ( like literally a MP can live in Bukit Timah and contest in Marine Parade ) there are people who are more keen on issues on a national stage rather than in their own individual constituencies. They rather a shitty(?) handling of their GRC for more representation in the Parliament."

Anyone who tells you that the PAP could lose all their seats in a freak result is not being honest with you. In that situation, any coalition government is likely still going to include the PAP. \n\nBut coming back to the point at hand: if we talk about the policies, the truth is that we won\u2019t know what the impact will be because a bunch of them are relatively long term plans.

Both sides have their arguments on whether or not we should have a reserved presidency for a specific race and the arguments on POFMA. \n\nI actually don't think it is that easy for any government to pass good policy. Our neighbours in the north are a perfect example of this, given our geographical location and similar historical roots. Given they are a country with natural resources, they are probably able to survive all the flip-flopping (and infighting) on policy issues.\n\nThe most important thing is arguably having balance, as you highlighted with the examples of several mixed and coalition governments around the world. We will need to find our own balance over time. The ruling party believes this balance is best achieved via NCMP, while the opposition believes it can be achieved by denying a supermajority. Time will tell what is true balance Singaporeans that want."

This is actually the main point of discontention between political parties. If let's say one party proposes additional healthcare subsidies, the other may just reject it because they deem it as insufficient or because they disagree with its costs. We see this in the US where almost all bills are rejected because of the political affiliation and beliefs of their representatives.

The point of the post was to bring people back to being objective. Sure you can be unhappy, but what exactly are people unhappy about? Is it because people are not feeling the benefits as you mentioned, or is it because they are unhappy over something else. Also, does it mean that if you did not feel the benefits, the policies have had no impact on others? \n\nWe really seem to be losing this objectivity during this election period, especially in the heat of all the rhetoric from both sides. People can vote for whoever they want, but they should think through clearly the reason why they are voting for them."

E.g. the race restrictions on the Presidential Elections. \n\nI would say that if you truly want to achieve balance in the government and not let the majority party get away with any changes in the constitution, denying PAP a super majority in the Parliament is the only way to go. And c'mon does anyone really think that having 9 NMPs in the Parliament is really going to provide any sort of balance in the Parliament? It just gives additional voices in the debate, but PAP MPs are still going to vote along party lines regardless of what the opposition or the NMPs bring up.  \n\n\nPAP does incredible things i agree, but having a clear distinct super majority in any Parliament is bad. It defeats the purpose of having a sizeable number of people in the parliament involved in the decision making if >90% are just going to vote the same exact thing."

More of a Party vs Party Scenario rather than a PAP vs Opposition Scenario. This helps to get rid of so many stigmas from either side, and also maybe the Opposition parties will do more than just craft their mandate against PAP. Shouldn't the parties fight to convince us to vote for them with their plans and promises, rather than trying to bring the other party down? \nAnd even though having multiple parties form the Parliament may not make the decision-making as smooth and fast as it is now, but i rather there be some sort of check and balance done in passing constitutional decisions rather than the situation we have currently.\n\nBut yeah, probably any of these drastic changes won't happen for the next few GEs. But Im all for change and at least some sort of diversity in decision making in SG. And i think we're also seeing an increased competency from the Opposition candidates, so maybe voting Opposition can be a viable option for some of us now, so here's to hoping that the future GEs would be much more balanced than it is now."

                "comment": "> # Bus, MRT ridership halves amid coronavirus outbreak\n\n> Public transport ridership has halved since the coronavirus outbreak emerged in January, and is expected to fall further when stricter stay-home measures kick in today.\n\n> This is from a fall of 20 per cent or so last month, reflecting more people working from home now.\n\n> The Land Transport Authority (LTA), which provided the figures yesterday, also said it is training transport ambassadors \"who will be deployed progressively from this week\" to remind commuters to keep a safe distance from one another.\n\n> Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan told the House yesterday: \"We accept the fall in demand for buses and trains. It means that Singaporeans are staying at home more, and doing what they need to do around their immediate neighbourhood.\n\n> \"This is not the time to use our public transport to get to the other side of Singapore for your favourite hawker dish.\n\n> \"When the Transport Minister had to suspend ERP (electronic road pricing) and COE (certificate of entitlement), and discourage the use of public transport, you know the situation is serious.\"\n\n> LTA told The Straits Times the demand for public transport has dropped by around 50 per cent since the start of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n> The elevated set of safe distancing measures, including full home-based learning and the closure of most physical workplaces, that kick in from today till May 4, \"is expected to further lower ridership\".\n\n> Nominated MP Walter Theseira, an associate professor of economics at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said the anticipated further drop in ridership should be enough to allow safe distancing on buses and trains to happen.\n\n> With this, public transport operators will not be able to recover costs, he added. \"It's clear that with these measures, train operators are going to need subsidies, and for buses, Government will see more losses.\"\n\n> In cities which have implemented \"lockdowns\" to combat the pandemic, public transport ridership figures had plunged by as much as 90-plus per cent, according to Israeli mobility app company Moovit last month. Two weeks ago, New York City cut back bus and train services as ridership plunged by as much as 90 per cent.\n\n> Meanwhile, Nominated MP Yip Pin Xiu suggested staggering school hours when home-based learning ends. This, she said, will avert the \"large crowds in trains and buses\" in the morning and when schools end.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

Too little demand, they're better off taking taxis. Too much demand, (there should just be) a regular bus service.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM FOR ON-DEMAND BUSES\n\n> On-demand bus services exist in various cities worldwide, with varying degrees of success.\n\n> Kutsuplus, which began operating in Helsinki in 2013, ended operations after two years as the authorities deemed it too costly.\n\n> And in January Chariot, - which operated in various US cities and was owned by carmaker Ford - announced it was closing shop.\n\n> However, local start-up SWAT - part of the Goldbell engineering and transport group \u2013 says it still sees a future for on-demand bus services.\n\n> The firm has existing projects in Singapore, Australia, and Vietnam, and is expected to begin operations in Indonesia, The Philippines, Japan and China in the coming months.\n\n> \n\n> SWAT was one of two firms participating in the LTA's on-demand bus trial, with the other being United States-based Via.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cWith increasing congestion due to rapid urbanisation and infrastructure limitations, we believe that on-demand ride-pooling in buses is the way of the future,\u201d said SWAT chief executive and co-founder Jarrold Ong.\n\n> He added that such services can provide efficient public transport in areas where traditional fixed bus routes are not viable.\n\n> The most successful roll-outs have been in providing first-and-last mile connections to train, metro and trunk bus lines, he noted.\n\n> Mr Ong noted that while SWAT\u2019s primary focus is on working with governments to provide its services as part of public transport, as well as with companies for employee transport arrangements, it is also exploring other areas such as the use of autonomous vehicles.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

                "comment": "> # Longer wait for trains during off-peak hours possible in future: Khaw Boon Wan\n\n> SINGAPORE - Commuters may in the future have to wait longer for trains during off-peak hours, as part of efforts to better match demand and supply.\n\n> Noting that demand for train services is not uniform throughout the day, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that managing headways better will help to reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the system.\n\n> Mr Khaw, who was speaking on Friday (Aug 30) at the SBS Transit (SBST) Sengkang Depot to celebrate improvements in rail reliability, noted that in July, the MRT network recorded a mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) of over 1 million train-km. This measures the distance travelled before a train fault that lasts more than five minutes.\n\n> It is now time to extend the focus from immediate fixes to also include longer-term sustainability, he said.\n\n> On longer intervals between trains, Mr Khaw said there is scope for this during off-peak hours, and that he will encourage the rail operators to experiment with such measures in their train lines.\n\n> Matching of supply with demand \"should lead to better customer service\", he said.\n\n> Citing the example of Taipei Metro and Hong Kong MTR, which have train intervals of up to 10 and 14 minutes respectively during off-peak hours, he said: \"By adjusting train frequencies based on commuter demand, they optimise the use of resources.\n\n> \"This also reduces unnecessary wear and tear on the system that drive up downstream maintenance costs.\"\n\n> Currently, SMRT and SBST trains arrive at stations every five to seven minutes during off-peak hours.\n\n> Mr Khaw noted that longer intervals between trains is already the case for the Changi Airport and Tuas West Extension lines.\n\n> It is the same for bus services.\n\n> Cost-efficiency is another key area of focus, Mr Khaw said, adding that new efforts and initiatives by SMRT and SBST have led to total savings of more than $25 million.\n\n> One such initiative is an SMRT-developed simulator that allows the train operator to more effectively repair their tracks. SMRT said the machine, which was introduced in 2018, can reap about $70,000 worth of savings a year.\n\n> Train operators have, in recent years, expressed concerns about higher operating costs.\n\n> Related Story Vivian Balakrishnan explains what planners are doing to keep costs of transport system down\n\n> Related Story New rail facility in Tuas aims to reduce MRT line testing closures\n\n> In July, SMRT Trains reported mounting losses on the back of higher operating expenses. In the 12 months to end-March this year, losses hit $155 million - almost double from a year ago.\n\n> Spending on repairs and maintenance accounted for about 71 per cent of rail-fare revenue, up from just 45 per cent three years ago.\n\n> Meanwhile, SBS Transit's Downtown Line has registered losses of $125 million over the past three years, while its train division also lost tens of millions of dollars.\n\n> The Transport Ministry had said that such losses were not sustainable and that higher fares would be needed in the face of rising subsidies for public transport.\n\n> Beyond cost savings, Mr Khaw said train operators are also looking to boost non-rail revenues.\n\n> The Land Transport Authority recently outsourced the rights for retail and advertising on the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) as part of efforts to improve the line's financial sustainability.\n\n> This marks the first time non-fare businesses, which are currently run by MRT operators, have been outsourced.\n\n> The move is expected to bring over $164 million in concession fees for the LTA over the 16-year concession term.\n\n> Mr Khaw said: \"The two appointed non-fare operators are expected to bring in significantly more non-fare revenue per rider as compared to today.\n\n> \"Given this promising outcome, LTA is exploring how we can expand the outsourcing framework to other train lines.\"\n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

However, the Singapore government actually owns large swathes of the economy, which does count as 'social ownership' in Marxist and democratic socialist thought. In policymaking, the Singapore government often uses that market power as a lever. The government, however, embraces capitalist thought to reduce overreliance on welfare (maybe a little too much, but nowhere quite as bad as in the US). \n\nI think the fact that many policies are actually rather leftist is often ignored by the local populace, and is a really good observation that you made. The largest single source of government revenue, and hence the largest source of social policy funding, is actually not even taxation anymore; it is from government-linked corporations like singtel and sovereign wealth funds!\n\nTry putting that into a political alignment compass/spectrum. A government that funds social policy using socially owned means of production (leftist!), but also via a glorified hedge fund (state capitalist?). Singapore can even be argued to be slightly more socialist in this regard than, say, China after DXP but before the 21st Century, where the populace has essentially zero control over the means of production. In Singapore, state-owned enterprises do bend to popular pressure as the ministers need to remain electable, especially for companies like SMRT.\n\nOn the other hand, attracting foreign companies and promoting local startups directly via government grants seems distinctly capitalist. I think the Singaporean system is really rather unique and often (but not always) takes the best ideas from various sometimes contradictory schools of thought. I do really like your thoughts on the book! It really has always been kinda obvious in my mind that ideological purity isn't a desirable trait at all, and I don't understand why so many leftists and libertarians insist on it."

Most Singaporeans aren't going to think this way, though, because when you're only seeing one thing of yours for long enough, you can only really ever see its flaws.... grass is greener, etc, and I think it might be a societal attitude to complain in general.\n\nHonestly, I agree with you that he's blunt and hilarious throughout, and honestly when I was reading through it the first time I was just like - \"balls. Endless, iron-clad, *balls.*\" That's what he had, and what he did throughout.\n\nI disagree with you that you can ascribe all of his policies to him as a monolithic figure: he certainly took on a lot of the credit and the blame, but the cabinet ministers that you comfortably dismiss in this post are *also* key and familiar figures to a lot of my generation growing up. This isn't like looking back at Winston Churchill (even though technically LKY did in this book) or Abraham Lincoln or even Alexander Hamilton - you are talking to a people who were within two degrees of this history playing out - either they lived through it themselves *or* their parents / older relatives did. For instance my father was in the second intake of the National Service (NS) that this book mentions - and that means that I could - and did - ask my father about his experience colored by the specific happenings in the book.   You have the benefit of being able to get to a ridiculous number of primary sources even if they're not educated or computer-literate (which is... rare, given the impacts of the policies that LKY implemented). Goh Chok Tong, for instance. For reader comfort (especially if your reader is more familiar with complicated policies being simplified down to one person), I understand this tendency, but I would warn against *yourself* as the writer making this mistake.\n\nI also think that the character of the Singaporean people (both at the time and in the present) plays a very large though to-Westerners invisible part in the book - and it's absent from this review. It's mostly contextual, and that focusing on his policies and looking at numbers is, while valuable, in a way missing a very key point. LKY was very, very aware of his people's character and ways of thinking, in part because he shared some of it himself - it's in some of the quotes you mention, even. And so he and his ministers were able to reshape things around key levers that almost all of his population shared, even with the general diversity and race - there were some key commonalities that have come ahead now to define \"cliches\" and/or in some ways memes now in Singaporean culture...especially in the boomer generation, which is the generation that was born into and lived through his reshaping of the country.\n\nIf you're looking to publish to Western audiences, I think it would be worthwhile to learn a bit more about this aspect - if you're making *any* recommendations, say, for America to learn, you need the underlying context, too.\n\nEdit: I do really appreciate the research you put into the numbers and the observation of that continuous tinkering around the policies that LKY and his cabinet did, though - that's a *very* good observation and useful for recommendations, because he doesn't outright say it in his book - he's a very paternal figure in a lot of ways, laying down The Law and all that."

The more sensationalist media for a longer time, the more bipartisan, etc.  I'm from (in) a slightly less bipartisan country (but also, a smaller country) in that people are more driven to focusing on the party rather than the policy, and because of the more moderate political views there's a fair bit of coalition going on *anyway.* It makes it harder for tribalism to take root when it's not a \"if you're not with us you're with *them\"* thing going on... and all the associated outcasting and demonizing of the out-tribe is difficult when *your* tribe just allied with theirs.\n\nThere are still two major parties here, and traditional clusters of parties - ecology party with our left, for instance, and all of them with major voter blocs - but the independent parties have been known to switch sides as well. \n\nDXP was tutored by LKY and thus that, combined with the mainland *Chinese* natural character and the times back then, led to a slight difference in that China was quite a bit larger than Singapore and so had a slower feedback loop - it was diluted by necessity. \n\nOf course the local populace ignores the \"leftism\" of the policies - the Singapore left is very different to the American left as other posters brought up in this thread; but also that it's very hard to pick out the \"leftism\" among all the authoritarian messaging - I'm sure this will come up more in OP's second post, though (\"you are free to agree\")."

As OP's point about carrying scooters into homes shows, the PAP gave Singaporeans ownership and thus shifted the metric of governance from \"do I agree with their ideas\" in the 50s and 60s to \"am I happy with my finances\".\n\nThe latter question is much easier to answer and persuade with, because you can't argue with tens of thousands of HDBs, hundreds of thousands of new jobs and a vastly improved quality of life.\n\nTo this day, this attitude still holds true in many of the older generations (like my parents) as well as young adults, who are used to (and often take for granted) competence in government. One only has to look at the responses to the great train delays of the early 2010s to get a picture of how Singaporeans expect the best from public services and how falling short of previous standards can lead to widespread annoyance. During election season, the questions that many Singaporeans ask is \"do I trust xyz party to run the country?\" rather than \"do I agree with the policies of xyz party?\"\n\nIt's neither objectively good or bad, but such focus on results has most certainly changed the Singaporean psyche, leading to the kiasu-ism we see where results are everything and not buying into the rat race almost turns you into a pariah. Make of this what you will, but I personally doubt we can continue with this mindset."

You mention it a bit, but I want to emphasize that there's a useful purpose in focusing the review on LKY in particular. He's quick to lavish praise on Keng Swee, Rajaratnam, and the rest for their central roles, and reading the book I definitely got a strong sense of the number of capable and talented leaders Singapore relied on for its growth. When I considered the task of condensing it for an international, largely unfamiliar audience, though, I had the choice of either introducing them to a quick succession of impressive figures, or really underscoring the point of one man's remarkable leadership.

Though, hindsight, as you point out.\n\nI'll have to check out his non-memoir stuff to have a look at it then! Based on the international relations portion of *this* book and the other memoirs he seems to have been rather incisive (albeit from a very British/Chinese point of view), I'll have to see where the broad generalizations are coming from."

                "comment": "> I had the choice of either introducing them to a quick succession of impressive figures, or really underscoring the point of one man's remarkable leadership. My impression was that people would retain more from the second option\n\nThat's certainly fair enough - for a comprehensible read it's a much easier thing to do and write about, *especially* given that - as someone else mentioned on this thread - LKY taking much of the credit was very much a public relations policy...especially to politicians in the West, hilariously enough... *because* it was easier for people to deal with him and his very blunt...LKYness as a known quantity, while allowing him to slip certain things by using his ministers when they were wheeling and dealing. Which I suppose indicates another point of his remarkable leadership, and his ability to delegate. On the other hand, there's already a lot of scholarship about LKY, and not so much about the other very important leaders, so I'm not sure that narrowing the focus that much more is that good a thing - from a recent Western source at that (recent as in whenever you publish this). Perhaps a brief introduction at some point about those other leaders and/or in an appendix, and then simply mentioning those names as influences underscoring LKY's leadership?\n\nNote that there is a significant if qualified reaction against LKY in Singapore culture - you can see that on this thread itself - so any attempt at glorifying him to a Western audience is going to run up against significant backlash from Singaporeans (which, given our diaspora, means it's going to pop up on your reviews), especially those from a younger generation and/or those who resented his policies from the older...and more from those who *left* - even I left for a reason as much as I admire LKY. I think - so imo only - that presenting a more rounded picture would be good for a deeper dive, while focusing on LKY's primacy is good for a brief summary or \"A Westerner's thoughts\" kind of approach. While a good middle ground (again, imo) would be to acknowledge the success of the PR policy of LKY leading above and beyond *while* hinting at and leading to scholarship *about* those other figures. \n\n>  One of my biggest takeaways from a policy standpoint was the importance of evaluating policies not in an abstract, idealized context, but with a clear view of the actual cultural forces on the ground.\n\nAs I mentioned, there's the benefit of a *lot* of primary sources you can hit - while obviously at the moment Singapore's borders are closed and for good reason, there are any number of biographies - Goh Keng Swee, for instance, published a biography as did Rajaratnam, which can serve as a point of comparison as to underlying cultural attitudes in terms of what accords with LKY and what *doesn't.* \n\nOn the other hand, you can also look at what forces drove the coolies out of China, for instance, and what the kind of people that came over look for; while a lot of the policy in the book is high-level politicking with some minor coverage of the results, there was also a culture that came together out of the \"melting pot\" of a lot of races mixing together in close quarters; the predominance of Chinese (which impacted the race riots and the Malaysia situation or were impacted by it). It's more useful to look at mainland Chinese culture around the turn of the 20th century, since that's about when and where the culture of the first Chinese immigrants started from. Look at, perhaps, Roots, by Oliver Chong, an autobiographical play that was specifically about someone tracing back their roots to a small village in China; and what that would imply.\n\nI definitely have *thoughts* and *opinions* on this and starting points, and this reply is getting very long - would you like to take it to PMs?"

This is a good thought, though, and if I do pull this out again and try to polish it to a state worth actually trying to get somewhere official, I'll most likely do this.\n\nI'm familiar with a lot of the backlash against LKY, though of course more from distant observation than from an insider standpoint. When addressing a Western audience, that backlash is much of what people have already been exposed to. The general attitude towards Singapore tends to be \"cool that they manage such a high standard of living, but such a shame they used such an authoritarian quasi-dictatorship to get there\". As my review makes obvious, I think that's a pretty myopic attitude to have predominant in Western consciousness, one that ignores the elegant approaches Singapore has taken for problems that continue to lurk in the US and elsewhere. \n\nI wrote this proceeding from an assumption that people are more familiar with the bad about Singapore than the good, and that there's a lot of good worth celebrating and noticing. I'm less than impressed with the political situation in the US right now, and I feel like a lot of the trouble is coming from a general refusal to properly learn from the political experiences of other countries (outside maybe western Europe). Much of what I write here is colored at least a bit by that.\n\nOf course, I'm still far from an expert, only an interested amateur. I'd like to get a more rounded picture over time and understand more of other key figures and the worthwhile scholarship, so I appreciate the starting points you've pointed to (and I'd love to hear more of your *thoughts* and *opinions*!

He has an excessively verbose style of communication (his writings frequently run on for several thousand words when he could have conveyed the same ideas in half the length), and quite often he makes speculations that are not entirely evidence-based (or at least the evidence available does not necessarily support his interpretations), without always explicitly specifying that those are merely speculations. There are a few areas with which I am more familiar than him, so I know that some of the things he writes are subtly wrong, which makes it difficult for me to appreciate his other writings on things I don't know much about."

No, see, if it was something on the *scale* of the Big Dig I'd be - well, I wouldn't be pleased but I would understand. No, we're a small country - population-wise roughly equal to Singapore, even if the landmass is much larger, so not getting shit sorted over more than *ten years* is really shit. Part of that has to do with the way that power is rarely held for more than four years per party and leader, with the longest (and most constructive) stretch happening with a nine-year term. \n\nIt's understandable, but frustrating, that whenever a party comes into power and makes changes they *have* to think about the short-term because that's what's keeping them in in the next election, and if the vote swings the other way (as it will of course do because \"edumacated\" and lowest common denominator voters) all the progress of the previous party gets eliminated. I see this in America as well, but even worse, because at least in a small country like mine the inertia is less, so even though it's a terrible thing to keep swinging back and forth we're at least not afflicted by *too* many things from say, a contemporary to Clinton.\n\nEdit: I agree with you about disillusionment. Where I am also houses the same core demographic for my country as the SJW radical left movement in the states, and growing up in it was a constant fucking battle, *despite* being part of the community that the SJW community is supposedly fighting for. And of course jumping from *that* into NS was a fucking hilarious cultural shift... and then *back* for uni."

I personally enjoy his speculative writing a great deal, including the verbosity, but I agree it's not for everyone. The research analyses, though, are my gold-standard for evidence-based writing, and [the authors of some of the papers he reviews](https://twitter.com/matthewckeller/status/1126380891243188224?lang=en) concur. \n\nNo writer is perfect, but he rigorously cites his sources, draws from a wide pool of evidence, and is careful to present a range of perspectives. When he gets a point of research wrong, he's quick to acknowledge it, including [a prominent list of significant mistakes](https://slatestarcodex.com/mistakes/), and he regularly promotes critical responses of his work. The commenters there also tends to be on top of things and are quick to point out weaknesses. Generally speaking, I trust him to present a fuller picture and to be ready to acknowledge the limitations of his understanding more than almost any other writer around."

Although this isn't linked to me losing my card, my deets were probably stolen via some online site (still can't figure out which), or when I ate at some dubious restaurant.\n\nSome tips:\n\n\\- If you're overseas and using mainly cash, keep your debit card securely somewhere else since you'd be mostly using your cash. I keep it in my backpack; in a secret compartment unreachable from outside (some may argue to never keep your valuables in your bag; but like I've said it's in a super secret compartment not accessible from outside, and I also look after my bag at all times)\n\n\\- In iBanking, you can lower the threshold that'll trigger a OTP alert and also when you'll receive a notification. I've since lowered them to the lowest possible value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very likely that you'll get your money back in full so fret not and enjoy the rest of your worktrip!"

I found out my entire bag was gone and checked my ibank immediately and almost all my money is gone from the account already (so like within 0.5-1 hour). Lucky that account is my \"spending\" account so usually only have ~$200, but at that time i had around $660 and $630 was gone. I reported to OCBC and they did give my money back (after like a month+), except the $100 liability. Maybe next time the card you bring to travel overseas can be linked to a separate account with only $100+ in it. Still can use to buy some stuff when you run out of overseas currency, and when you need to use the card for big purchases can transfer from your other account. More troublesome but at least if you really do lose the card, the loss is minimal."

                "comment": "I think at this point of time, majority of the population, especially in Singapore, is totally clueless about the security vulnerability of the decades old SMS technology. they are not aware that it's almost totally unencrypted and can be subjected to man in the middle attacks like SS7 abuse and other ways be bring intercepted to receive the SMS OTP for online transactions.\n\n[Why You Shouldn't Use SMS for Two-Factor-Authetication](https://www.howtogeek.com/310418/why-you-shouldnt-use-sms-for-two-factor-authentication/)\n\nGoogle has long ago identified this security flaw and prompted it's users to move on to its new prompt based 2FA method way back in 2016. And it has only been recently implemented across banks in Singapore last year in 2017. Whereby Banks here are also now trying to do away with 2FA via SMS when trying to log in to your internet Banking. I can see why Banks are rolling out these changes quietly without much elaboration because that's when customers and cardholders all go nuts knowing that the SMS OTP has always been their last and best line of defence when it comes to safeguarding their money.\n\nthe best part is seeing comments scolding the bank for making unnecessary changes like these and don't fix what is not broken and doing this is not user friendly and makes life difficult for them and they want it to be revert back to SMS else they will take their money out and put it with another Bank.\n\nall I can say is, I'm not sure if this move from SMS to device based 2FA prompt and OTP is something mandated by the MAS, if it's not, and any of the Banks that I'm currently banking with were to tell me don't worry they will not be making this move, I'm definitely taking my money out from them instead. \n\nAnd other than banking, please also migrate your other online accounts from SMS 2FA to device based 2FA instead (if that site supports it). You can start it off right here with your Reddit account. there are many device based OTP generator app out there and the best part is that you just need to choose 1 and it should allow you to add your various different online accounts like Google, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, AWS, PayPal, Discord, LastPass, Dropbox, Snapchat and more. \n\nI'm personally using the Microsoft Authenticator because I'm using a Samsung S9+ and the Microsoft Authenticator is the only one that supports unlocking of the authenticator app via Iris.. on top of the usual PIN/Fingerprint offered by others."

                "comment": "> #New rail infrastructure adds to rising costs of public transport: PTC chair Richard Magnus\n\n> SINGAPORE: The Public Transport Council (PTC) will consider the rising cost of maintaining new rail infrastructure as it goes into its annual fare review exercise, PTC chairman Richard Magnus said on Thursday (Oct 19).\n\n> The council will also consider whether free pre-peak travel and lower off-peak travel fares will be made permanent.\n\n> Mr Magnus wrote in a blog post, titled\u00a0Balancing Sustainability and Affordability, that the council \"cannot turn a blind eye\" to rising costs as it has to ensure the \"viability of the public transport system\".\n\n> He detailed the cost of investments in public transport, such as the new Downtown Line and bus contracting subsidies.\n\n> The Government\u2019s investments in new rail infrastructure will cost S$20 billion over the next five years, and comes on top of S$4 billion to renew, upgrade and expand rail operating assets, he wrote. Another S$4 billion will be spent on bus contracting subsidies over the same period.\n\n> \"While these investments are a necessary part of the Government\u2019s push to improve the public transport experience, they raise operating costs and impose a heavy cost burden on taxpayers,\" he said.\n\n> OFF-PEAK TRAVEL REVIEW\n\n> The PTC will also review the findings of the Free Pre-Peak Travel and the Off-Peak Pass trials.\n\n> The council will assess if the tiered fares to incentivise off-peak travel should become a permanent feature, Mr Magnus said.\n\n> \"The concentration of travel within a few hours each day is resource-intensive and inefficient. A more sustainable solution is to spread out travel demand across the day.\" he said.\n\n> \"The council is therefore evaluating travel patterns to determine how a differential fare mechanism can best help smoothen travel demand in Singapore.\"\n\n> Mr Magnus highlighted that Singapore\u2019s rail fares are among the lowest in Asia, and considerably lower than those in Australian, European and North American cities. The council has also got feedback from commuters that fares are affordable through focus group discussions, he said.\n\n> \"We must, and will, continue to keep the voices of our commuters firmly at the forefront, even as we consider the rising costs. We will announce our fare decision in due course,\" he said.\n\n> [Source](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fare-review-adds-to-rising-costs-of-public-transport-magnus-9325772)\n\n---\nv1.1 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md)"

Demand was certainly high at that point of time, and a price surge is one incentive to get more Uber cars on the streets.\n\nUber's 5x price surge (which, I agree, is ridiculous) was probably an automated mechanism that was triggered due to extremely high demand (my guess). Disabling surge is only an act of goodwill on Uber's part and wasn't something Uber had to do; they're after all a business that survives on profits.\n\nWhether Uber decides to refund the surges charged is also entirely their choice, but I guess in their best interests they would."

[But there is a non-evil reason behind this.](https://medium.com/@jimbumbulsky/the-true-economics-of-ubers-surge-pricing-2ed9de90fcae)\n\nUber's marketing point (maybe not clear in Singapore) is that you will always get a car when you request for one. Price is the way it differentiates between the urgency of a customer. A passenger heading to the hospital to see their parents on their dying bed would have gotten a car while a rich office person may have just decided to spend the 5x surge fee on a nice dinner in the city. The price serves as a mechanism to allocate drivers to the most in need passengers. \n\nWithout the surge pricing, there would be no way of allocating cars based on need. Whoever presses the button first would get the car. Uber would not have cars available in that area, and no one can get a car. Surge pricing makes the passenger reconsider.\n\nCredit card payment of Uber also means you don't have to worry about the cost yet as you rush off to your important destination. Uber can also refund some of the fee after negative PR pressure before the bill comes in. "

However, I don't agree with that as uber markets itself and acts like a public transport taxi service but at the same time uses such predatory business tactics. If they want to market themselves as a taxi alternative, then play by the same rules with regulation of drivers, cars, availability and fares. If they want to be private car hire then market themselves as that. That's a reason for regulations to safeguard interest of the public with regards to public transport. Looking back to the days of unlicensed taxis in the past, I would say that a dose of regulation is good for this industry. If free market was in play for public transportation, then your bus and mrt fares will be 10 dollars cause who's going to compete with them? You might understand their business model and identify them as not a public transport, but is it the fault of the commuters not understanding that, as uber has marketed itself as a taxi alternative and not a private hire alternative.

But the price is made clear with the app. \n\nWhether it is possible for Uber and the drivers to abuse the system and inflate the prices is unclear to me (i never use before).

In fact one common mistake for us is to chase the surge, only to enter surge zone and surge ends. \n\nI think normal surge up to 2x is quite ok, anything more or due to natural disasters as in the States, or due to trains failing, the surge should be capped at, say 3X. \n\nDriving for uber is stressful, cause you keep thinking and looking out for surge, chasing it, or upon getting it have to deal with picky customers since they are paying for surge pricing. That's why I'm still sticking to driving for Grab only. \n\nEdit: surge pricing and estimate is clearly shown in passenger app. They will ask you to key 5x go confirm they know the fares are 5x before booking goes through. \n\n Complaining after knowing that's going to be the price, oh man, quite retarded to be honest.

                "comment": "You clearly missed the context of my argument. What I'm saying is surge pricing is bad for public transport, because public transport is to cater for the public and not just the rich and fares are regulated to prevent pricing out the folks of a certain income level. If uber doesn't try to portray itself as a public transport provider and instead portray itself as a private chauffeur service with variable prices, there's no issue with that. If essential goods with not much substitutability are based on demand and supply alone, things that are essential such as transportation will be priced out of reach of people of certain income. Just like public and private hospitals, there's nothing wrong with private hospitals charging more, but don't advertise themselves as public hospitals and charge private prices as that is preying on most people's preconceived expectations on public goods."

Ticket sales started at 12pm, and the counter service at APO managed to secure the 4 VIP tickets, and charged us exactly $1248.00. \n\nHowever, for some unbelievable reason, he didn't manage to get them to print!!!! Why??? Nobody has a clue. So they had already taken our 1k+, but we didn't get our tickets.\n\nUnderstandably infuriated, I called Apactix and Singpost to question: why couldn't the counter service officer do a SIMPLE and frankly elementary level skill of printing 4 tickets? I was then advised to send them an email including the receipt and our Apactix account number and they would get back to me.\n\nA week later, Apactix's customer service officer Cien contacted my sister, and told me this, in their words:\n\n\"We will refund you the tickets in full, and give you 4 Cat 1 tickets, as all the VIP tickets are out of stock.\"\n\nI double-checked with her, in my words: \"You will refund all $1248, and give me the Cat 1 tickets? So essentially I don't have to pay anything?\"\n\nShe replied, \"yes. Can I have your address so that I can mail you the tickets?\"\n\nI gave her my address and forgave them for their mistake. After all, it was an honest mistake.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks later: no tickets have appeared. I'm confused; you told me that you would mail them, and then I don't see any tickets in my mailbox? So I Facebook-messaged Apactix, at which they replied that they would get in contact with my sister.\n\nTurns out that the tickets got lost in mail! Apactix did not give me the option to choose what sort of mailing (keep in mind, these tickets are worth in total $992, they LITERALLY sent almost $1k worth of goods in NORMAL MAIL). So they told my sister that she could go down to collect the tickets at Sportshub, which we were fine about.\n\nShe went down to collect the tickets on 5/9/2017 at Sportshub, got terribly lost for an hour, but yay she finally got our tickets! And so we thought the saga was over.\n\nBut it wasn't.\n\nToday, 6/9/2017, my sister received a call from Apactix. She was very confused, and passed the phone to me.\n\nThey told me, to my ears, without any joking spirit at all:\n\n\"The Cat 1 tickets you have are of paid value, and you will have to pay us the $992+ (incl booking fee).\"\n\nWhen I heard that, I almost started laughing.\n\nSo firstly: your customer service officer told me, with her own words written above, that the tickets would not be charged to me. Secondly, you had TWO WEEKS to get back to me about this, for not only 1 mistake, BUT MULTIPLE MISTAKES.\n\nAnd now I'm expected to pay? \n\nI asked to speak to the manager, Clarence. Who then proceeded to tell me, with his own words:\n\n\"This was an honest mistake from my staff, and I apologise, but you will have to pay in full. If not you have the choice to cancel the tickets.\"\n\nI replied him: \"Clarence, frankly, is your sorry worth $1000?\"\n\nHe could not reply me.\n\nSo let me repeat this story:\n1. You don't educate the staff who are selling your tickets on how to utilize the system, leading to me losing out on the tickets that I wanted.\n2. Your customer service officer tells me, which I confirmed twice with her, that I will be refunded in full, followed by being given 4 Cat 1 tickets without any extra charge.\n3. You send my tickets worth well over $900 in normal mail, without giving me the option to choose what sort of mail I want, despite the tickets being worth almost the amount of a diamond, thus losing my tickets.\n4. You wait 2 weeks to tell me that I am expected to pay IN FULL for tickets that I was given as a concession for not being able to get my VIP tickets.\n5. You don't even offer me anything, except a few simple words of \"sorry, my staff made a mistake\". And you tell me I can just simply cancel my tickets, even though I've waited MONTHS for this concert. Appalling, really.\n\nAs I reiterated to your customer service manager, your line is NOTHING. When people in hospitals make mistakes, it costs lives. They pay hefty amounts of money to the people who've lost family members. And you? You can't even give me a good reason. \n\nRest assured, I will be filing a report with CASE. I sincerely hope no one else has to deal with this business again.\n\n---\n(Posted on APACTIX Facebook) \n\nMy real life account of what happened with APACTIX, and IME, who til today have not responded to any of my queries. Do NOT support these people!!!!! They care absolutely nothing about customer satisfaction; it's almost comical to see how terrible they are at their jobs. "

This will definitely be something I'll look forward to checking out every month now.\n\nA couple of years back I attended an orchestra performance of the music from Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers.

Grab users are currently able to view upfront the cost of a private-hire GrabCar ride, which is a fixed price.\n>\n>But they can view only the estimated cost of a taxi ride, as it is based on the metered fare.\n>\n>The new fixed fares for taxis will, however, be subject to dynamic fares - also known as surge pricing - in which prices increase during periods of high demand.\n>\n>CHOOSING CABS\n>\n>The reason why most of us take taxis nowadays is to avoid the surge pricing periods that Uber and Grab implement.\n>\n>ADMINISTRATIVE EXECUTIVE COLIN CHEN, 29\n>\n>BETTER OR WORSE?\n>\n>Taxi companies should ensure that dynamic pricing improves and not worsens the matching of supply to demand for taxi services.\n>\n>SECOND MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT NG CHEE MENG\n>\n>These changes were spelt out in a document that Grab will be issuing to cabbies, seen by The Straits Times.\n>\n>Private-hire car services offered by Grab and Uber are already subject to surge pricing - making them generally cheaper during the off-peak hours but more expensive than metered taxis when demand is high. It is not known when the new system will come into effect.\n>\n>Grab declined comment when contacted yesterday.\n>\n>The Straits Times reported last week that Trans-Cab and Premier Taxi were working with Grab on plans to implement dynamic pricing.\n>\n>ComfortDelGro, the largest taxi operator here, confirmed it had also written to the Public Transport Council regarding plans to implement its own dynamic pricing.\n>\n>National Taxi Association executive adviser Ang Hin Kee said that while dynamic pricing could help cabbies earn more, it was important that taxi fares remained \"competitive\", compared with those of private-hire cars during peak periods.\n>\n>Commuters said surge pricing could drive them to look for alternatives.\n>\n>Digital director Ameera Begum, 29, said it would provide \"no incentive\" to turn to Grab taxis over a private-hire ride.\n>\n>In a Facebook post yesterday, Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng said that it was \"not unexpected\" that some commuters would be uncomfortable with the introduction of dynamic pricing.\n>\n>\"However, those who prefer not to use this new option can still choose to pay for a booked taxi by the meter,\" he said, adding that dynamic pricing would not apply for street hires.\n>\n>Mr Ng also noted that supply and demand would determine whether fares would be higher or lower under dynamic pricing.\n>\n>\"Taxi companies should ensure that dynamic pricing improves and not worsens the matching of supply to demand of taxi services,\" he said, adding that the matter would be discussed further during the Transport Ministry's budget debates later this week.\n>\n>\n\n\n===\n_^This ^bot ^was ^created ^by ^/u/LFlare, ^being ^too ^poor ^to ^afford ^ST ^subscription ^fees._\n\n_^[Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=LFlare&subject=[StraitsTimesNewsBot]%20)_"

It says on the SNRSI web site:\n\n\" Singapore has announced in parliament in October 2012 that it will not pursue nuclear power at this juncture with current NPP technology. It will wait for NPP technology and safety to improve further before reconsidering this option. However, Singapore needs to strengthen its capabilities to understand nuclear science and technology, in order to assess the implications for Singapore of evolving nuclear energy technologies and regional nuclear energy developments. \"\n\nSo I'm sure they would be very happy if you could study nuclear fusion and bring that expertise back. They just have a certain budget and decided not to give a scholarship in this area, because it's not close to practical application yet. It's blue sky research, and you will find that across all kinds of fields (e.g. biology), Singapore doesn't give a lot of monetary support towards blue sky research.\n\n&#x200B;"

It can supplement our energy needs but it cannot be backbone power. \n\nStorage of solar energy is not the same as storage of fuel. If solar is to become backbone power, then we need it for day and night. Batteries and capacitors will be prohibitively huge and costly and fossil footprint will be high. High cloud cover in singapore doesn\u2019t help. Since the cells are connected in series, if even one of them is in the shade, it cuts off current from all other cells. \n\nCentral station solar power is a viable source of backbone power as opposed to panel-on-every-rooftop but it requires large amount of space. Even if we do it in Malaysia, transmission of power over large distances will be a problem."

I'm personally trying to get into Airport Police since I live nearby and I'm tall (my FI and CM keep saying height good for APD).\n\nOverall life in NS SPF is pretty easy going I'd say. Just listen to what you're told to do, don't break any rules and make friends. You'll be fine. :D"

                "comment": "> I'm sure there are equally fulfilling vocations in various different forces but for SPF I do agree that being an NPCO is a life changing experience. \n\n\nFirst off, getting into SPF itself is already pretty cool. Like SCDF, once you finish training in SPF, you're put on the ground and you work alongside the regulars who are the same 'vocation' as you doing the same thing. So there's a lot more equal treatment and people really feel like part of the team.\n\nbut as for my take: I'm presenting the general view. (also NPCOs get promoted to SC/SGT regardless of qualification) but just comparing the other big ones in SPF like SOC or PCG. \n\nSOC: training, more training and mostly staying in base. don't really 'do' much or learn much (at least not about 'police procedure' as opposed to 'tactical procedure'). When deployed, basically just for presence.\n\nPCG: daily patrols unlike the above. but there's hardly any activity. mostly like a glorified sentry on the sea watching out for illegal immigrants. most of the time just sitting in a boat looking at the sea.\n\nTranscom: i hear the training isn't very good and this is apparent to most people as well. i don't think many people would actually favour this over npco.\n\nOCT: staff positions mostly. it's useful in a certain way, but for an NS experience to look back on, staff positions can be pretty lame. Of course the difference is you can tell others you were an Inspector. OCTs that get posted to line positions, now that's more interesting (e.g. the PCG ANO posting isn't too bad).\n\nlike honestly, NPCO experience (and the other ones like APD, and even Transcom etc) is the one that best carries over to future life. Good experiences to share and you learn about dealing with people. Yes, dealing with ordinary people not just dealing with uniformed people. problem is NPCO isn't that easy to get anyway."

I've been here since '96 and whenever people ask me why, I tell them:\n\n* It's safe. \n* It's clean. \n* The economy is relatively great, even when it's bad.\n* The food is stunning. \n* It's easy to get around. \n* It's modern. \n* It's efficient as hell.\n* I got a better education here (PSLE, O Levels, A Levels) than I could have ever hoped for back in the UK. I'm forever grateful for that and, as I can't do national service (long story), I want to pay my dues by contributing to the economy for as long as I can.\n\nI will eventually have to leave, though, and it'll be for the following reasons:\n\n* Culturally, we're still not there. Movies, music and theatre are major plus points in a city for me and eventually I'd like to live somewhere that has a better arts scene.\n* After a while, I am going to get restless and feel confined. Every time a friend leaves, they say the same thing - they love it here but they need something new. It's funny, the Singaporean culture of constant change eventually breeds a desire to change your surroundings.\n* Personal reason here, but my other half lives in the USA and I will have to make a move out there before long. And frankly, that excites me - going from a country smaller than greater London to a country where they have a state bigger than France is just mindblowing.\n* Beer. Unless something changes massively in five years. \n* The heat. Oh dear god, the heat. \n\nIt'll be a mixed day when I do leave, though. This place is awesome and whenever I hear a fellow expat bitch about Singapore I want to slap him around the face and bellow THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! HAVE YOU EVEN BEEN ON A TRAIN YOU FUCK?\n\n\n"

I met a research scientist from A*STAR at a conference last year in Buenos Aires and after a bit of a talk he said he could try get funding for me to come over and do some work with his group. That worked out so I'm here for 6 months to do science!\n\nFantastic place you have here. I'll be sorry to leave in 2 months."

Reasons why?\n\n* Low tax\n* Safe environment\n* Stable economy and good environment for businesses\n* Awesome food that is also cheap\n* Not as bureaucratic as the UK\n* Great airport and an awesome airline (I travel a hell of a lot so at least I know I'm going through a good place and in the case of delays I know I'm not going to be too fussed as the airport here is pretty good).\n* Close proximity to SE Asia and Western Australia where my sister lives. \n\nThings I don't like:\n\n* The heat. Why can't it snow?\n"

(Joking)\n\nI came here by chance and I liked it here - it's got economic freedom, decent law and order, great variety of food, and clean streets (i'd be outdoors all day if it wasn't so frigging hot). I also like the Asian melting-pot nature of the city. So I stayed.\n\nI can't stand the heat. I like the outdoors but the heat is such a deterrent. But I'm learning to live with it.\n\nI don't understand expats and foreigners who complain about the place and the people - because they came here of their own choice in the first place. I mean, wtf. If anyone deserves to complain, it's a local, because you didn't have a say in where you're born."
