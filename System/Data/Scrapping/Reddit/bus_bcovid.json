                "comment": "hi,yes they are. buses have a statutory lifespan of 17 years, which can be extended to 19 (19.5 maximum). the original superbus, the aircon leyland olympian, has already been retired. its successor, the volvo olympian (basically volvo bought leyland and continued production of the olympian) are in the process of retirement. one particular trivia - one of the leyland olympians in our fleet is the last leyland chassis ever to be produced in the whole world. that bus is now preserved by a uk based enthusiast, and is (i believe) the only leyland olympian not scrapped.there are other buses undergoing retirement as well.from sbs 1) volvo b10ms - basically, almost every non-wheelchair accessible single deck sbs bus is a volvo b10m, apart from a few cng volvo b10bles found mostly in the west. 2) sbs transit's mercedes-benz o405s were also retired a few years back. theyy have different bodywork from their smrt counterparts and are also older, with different gearbox. i don't have much memories of them as an enthusiast though. they retired when i just entered the hobby, but i liked their front wheelarch because i could sit there and pretend to be the driver (was still a little kid then)3) scania n113crb. they were already retired when i came into the hobby, so i have no memories of them. 4) dennis dart. they were the shortest public buses in singapore at time of retirement at 9.4m (standard buses are 12m). mostly found on services 92 and 42, though the 92 ones were retired early, while the ones on 42 served until the end of 17 years.from smrt -1)  mercedes-benz o405s. they're the characteristic boxy buses that you see on almost all smrt services. believe it or not as robust and as modern as they look and feel many of them are approaching 17, 18, 19 (the oldest) years old. their bendy variants are also getting retired. they're a bit younger at 17, but with the new double deckers coming in and lta's (and probably the public) stance towards bendies, they have not received any lifespan extension. 2) the scania l113crl, its retirement was quite recent in fact, just last week. they're the \"old looking\" buses that used to be found on routes 178, 187, 852, until their progressive retirement started this year. a different variant of the scania l113crl, the same chassis but a different bodywork, was retired in ~2012. probably the worst ever bus that smrt bought. they also used to be found often on 178/187/852 - they're the dusty, squeaky \"old looking\" buses and their aircon was crap. glad they're gone, but us bus enthusiasts used to chase them a lot because they mostly only appeared on 178/187/852, so any other service was quite the special occurrence. they're actually newer than all the o405s and they retired before their lifespan was up. most likely due to the horrible condition they were in.3) the hino hs3krk and dennis lance. these were also retired early due to the poor condition of the buses - they were about 13~14, maybe 15, at the time of retirement. the hinos were the last japanese bus bought by smrt and were found around cck, the dennis lances were based at ang mo kio depot and served yishun.most buses that are retired end up in the scrapyard - most at kranji, a few at other places. some have been exported to other countries - the sbs transit mercedes-benz o405s have been refurbished, re-engined and rebodied and are now running as public buses in thailand.pics:leyland olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/22193-6/sbs9000s-51.jpgvolvo olympian: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/8732-6/800x600xvo3x-premium-shentonway.jpg.pagespeed.ic.l-sfbdpuly.jpgthe volvo and leyland olympians are quite similar on the outside but there's a few notable differences, including engine type on the later volvos, the dashboard, lack of power steering for the leylands (made them very hard to steer) and 2 rear grilles on the leyland instead of 1 on the volvo.sbs transit mercedes-benz o405: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/622-10/sbs3798m-ct8.jpgsbs transit volvo b10ms: they came in several batches with different bodywork. all variants are going off now, some at 17 years and some at 19.http://www.sgbuses.com/d/47-10/sbs694z-99-sbs746h-96.jpg mark 3, retired in 2012http://www.sgbuses.com/d/9670-6/sbs886l-39.jpg mark 4 duple metsec, majority retired, ~40 out of 115 left in servicehttp://www.sgbuses.com/d/2633-8/sbs2631s-156.jpg mark 4 walter alexander strider. some are retiredhttp://www.sgbuses.com/d/2977-8/sbs2795c-15.jpg mark 4 duple metsec dm3500. just started retirementsbs transit scania n113crb: http://www.sgbuses.com/d/334-10/sbs3692j-225.jpg all retiredsbs transit dennis dart -

developed in 2015 by the then-infocomm development authority and the land transport authority - said it will cease operations on jan 1 2020.> advertisement> advertisement> beeline allows commuters to book private bus rides using a mobile app, with its routes determined by crowdsourced suggestions.> in 2017, the service reported having 130 routes and 19,000 monthly bookings.> \u201cthis decision will allow us to optimise our efforts and resources on developing products and services that can deliver benefits and convenience to more citizens,\u201d beeline said in a statement, adding that it had \u201csuccessfully served a number of singaporean commuters\u201d for four years.> it noted that beeline\u2019s code had been made open-source, to allow others to \u201ctake advantage of our codebase, building on it to create applications and platforms to help improve first-and-last mile connectivity in singapore\u2019s transport system.\u201d> advertisement> advertisement> separately ride-hailing giant grab is also ending operations for both grabshuttle and grabshuttle plus come january.> the two services differ in that grabshuttle - which is powered by beeline - operates on fixed-routes and timings.> meanwhile, grabshuttle plus - powered by canadian technology start-up rideco - offers dynamic bookings, similar to those of grab\u2019s ride-hailing offerings.> grabshuttle plus operates in areas such as punggol, sengkang, bedok, tampines and pasir ris, as well as routes to and from kranji camp ii and sungei gedong camp in the west.> these developments come after the lta ended a six-month trial of on-demand bus services in the joo koon and marina-downtown areas in june, citing the \u201chigh technology costs\u201d associated with offering such services.> redirecting of resources> in response to queries from cna, grab said the decision to discontinue the services \u2013 which it noted were introduced to meet the needs of a niche segment of riders \u2013 was unrelated to the shutting down of beeline.> > instead, it is aimed at allowing the firm to redirect its resources to \u201cfurther improving our core transport services to better serve our customers,\u201d said a spokesman for the singapore-based firm.> > grab declined to give ridership figures for either grabshuttle or grabshuttle plus, but noted its grabcoach service \u2013 which allows uses to charter buses for up to 40 people \u2013 will continue.> cna has contacted the government technology agency (govtech) for comment on beeline's decision to stop offering on demand buses.> > services like grabshuttle may not have been well-utilised and thus not financially viable for a private enterprise like grab, said singapore university of social sciences transport economist walter theseira.> he added that operating a successful transit service is difficult to do so profitably, noting it requires both reliable demand and customers who are willing to pay.> \u201con-demand services are (especially) hard because you need the demand to be just so. too little demand, they're better off taking taxis. too much demand, (there should just be) a regular bus service.\u201d> > not all doom and gloom for on-demand buses> on-demand bus services exist in various cities worldwide, with varying degrees of success.> kutsuplus, which began operating in helsinki in 2013, ended operations after two years as the authorities deemed it too costly.> and in january chariot, - which operated in various us cities and was owned by carmaker ford - announced it was closing shop.> however, local start-up swat - part of the goldbell engineering and transport group \u2013 says it still sees a future for on-demand bus services.> the firm has existing projects in singapore, australia, and vietnam, and is expected to begin operations in indonesia, the philippines, japan and china in the coming months.> > swat was one of two firms participating in the lta's on-demand bus trial, with the other being united states-based via.> > \u201cwith increasing congestion due to rapid urbanisation and infrastructure limitations, we believe that on-demand ride-pooling in buses is the way of the future,\u201d said swat chief executive and co-founder jarrold ong.> he added that such services can provide efficient public transport in areas where traditional fixed bus routes are not viable.> the most successful roll-outs have been in providing first-and-last mile connections to train, metro and trunk bus lines, he noted.> mr ong noted that while swat\u2019s primary focus is on working with governments to provide its services as part of public transport, as well as with companies for employee transport arrangements, it is also exploring other areas such as the use of autonomous vehicles.---1.0.2 | [source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

(sure, the counterargument is that you can put on and take off the sticker, but then if you put on the sticker at that point in the mrt, because you needed a seat at that time, then what? it imposes an explanation to the person giving up the seat as well. \"why do you need to seat? what injuries do you have?\")beyond that, this sticker has a lot of problems drawing distinctions of able-disabled binary where we should look beyond that and give to those in need. lta is purposefully drawing this line within the public transport spaces with the social good in mind but without considering other social factors.in addition, socially engineering this is not going to help, especially when intersectionality of age and disability has not been considered: i wanna see how a young person with sticker compete with the middle-aged and elderlies without stickers."

                "comment": "the answer is simple but not easy: to remove the categorization altogether beyond able-disable binary. essentially, it means when you give up this seat to this person, the schemas of the disabled and its current nuances are not used for or against the person. the difficulty (or ridiculousness of it, for most people) is that \"how can this be possible?\". but by allowing stickers, you reinforce that notion. so while not having stickers has its own issues, it's by far leading to the desired direction in the bigger picture.it gets a lot more theoretical (not that it does not impact reality), but i think the point isn't so much for us to deconstruct and reconstruct a whole reality at this point. what we want to see is whether lta has considered these medical ethics and social implications when pushing this idea instead of going ahead just to fulfill someone's improvement kpi and favourable performance index."
